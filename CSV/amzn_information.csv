Wal-Mart reports Q4 earnings February 21;2/18/2017;"What's HappeningRetail giant Wal-Mart (WMT) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on February 21. The company will report its quarterly numbers before the market opens, with the consensus calling for earnings of $1.30 per share, on revenue of $130.97 billion. The stock has risen a modest 0.3% on the year.Technical AnalysisWMT was recently trading at $68.87, down $6.32 from its 12-month high and $6.52 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for WMT are bearish but the stock is showing signs of a possible trend reversal. The stock has recent support above $65.50 and recent resistance below $69.25. Of the 23 analysts who cover the stock, eight rate it a ""strong buy"", 12 rate it a ""hold"", and three rate it a ""strong sell"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 5 STARS ""Strong Buy"" ranking.Analyst's ThoughtsWMT shares have been trending higher over the last month, but in order for the stock to build on its recent gains the company will need to show solid results for its fourth-quarter. Brick and mortar retailers have been punished in recent years by growing e-commerce competition, most notably from Amazon.com (AMZN), but Wal-Mart has made big strides in recent years to improve its online business. The company has invested a lot of money in its online business, and Wall Street wants to see ongoing improvements in the company's online business. Last quarter the company reported a 21 percent jump in online sales, much stronger growth than the 12 percent gain it enjoyed the previous quarter. Wall Street will pay close attention to the how strongly online sales grew in the most recent quarter. In addition to the company investing heavily in its e-commerce business, it has also been investing a lot in its employees, with additional training and wage hikes, which most analysts agree is starting to result in higher customer satisfaction, but the investments are hurting the company's bottom line in the short term. Earnings are expected to fall by 5.9% this year, before remain relatively flat in 2018. The earnings decline has been priced into the stock, which now trades with a P/E of just 14.9, so as long as the company is able to post results at least in-line with the consensus the stock should continue to make back some of its recent gains.Stock Only TradeIf you're looking to establish a long stock position in WMT, consider buying the stock under $69.00. Sell if it falls below $62.10 or take profits if it gets to $79.25.Bullish TradeIf you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on WMT, consider an April 60/62.50 bull-put credit spread for a 20-cent credit. That's a potential 8.7% return (50.4% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 9.0% to cause a problem.Bearish TradeIf you want to take a bearish stance on DE at this time, consider a June 75/77.50 bear-call credit spread for a 30-cent credit. That's a potential 13.6% return (41.8% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 9.3% to cause a problem.Covered Call TradeIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basis on a new position, you may want to consider an April $70.00 covered call. Buy WMT shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the April $70.00 call for a debit of $67.50 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 3.7%, and a target annualized return of 21.6% (for comparison purposes only)."
The Best Investments for an IRA;2/18/2017;"An IRA is a fantastic way to build long-term wealth, but it   can be tricky knowing which stocks or ETFs are best to own in   one. There are thousands of publicly traded companies and ETFs to   choose from, and they don't all deserve a spot in your portfolio.   How do you separate the good from the bad? It can help to   establish some ground rules. For example, are you a growth   investor, income investor, or value investor? Or are you a little   bit of each? OurIRA centercan help you figure out what approach is best for you, and   then, it's time to get down to picking investments. To help get   you started, here's one growth, one income, and one value   investment I think you ought to consider buying in your IRA.Getting in on growthIf your time horizon is 10 years, 20 years, or longer,   investing in companies that are reshaping big and growing   industries can be savvy. Disruptive companies can deliver   significant revenue and profit growth that can fuel   market-beating gains. For example,Alphabettransformed how we search and use information,Pricelineturned the travel market inside out, andNetflixre-envisioned how we consume video entertainment. In each of   these cases, investors savvy enough to tuck these stocks into   their IRAs were rewarded with massive returns: Since 2004, these   three companies are up 745%, 6,879%, and 8,121%,   respectively.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();While any one of those stocks could still be worth buying in   IRAs today, I thinkAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) might be an even better bet. Amazon is reshaping   retail, and I think there's plenty of room left for sales to   climb. Why? Because, according to the Census Bureau,   e-commerce sales account for just 8.4% of total retail sales, and   that's despite their growing 15% in the past year. I think   e-commerce companies will continue chipping away at traditional   retail, and if I'm right, then perhaps there's no company better   positioned to benefit than Amazon. The company's already the   biggest e-commerce company out there, and in 2016,   Amazon's net sales increased 27% to $136 billion. That's   pretty amazing growth for a company its size, but it may only be   the tip of the iceberg. After all, Amazon's revenue is still only   one-third ofWal-Mart'srevenue.Amazon also manages data in the cloud for many of the   country's biggest companies, and its Amazon Prime service is   carving out an important presence in entertainment. If you're   still not convinced, simply consider that Amazon's virtual   assistant -- Alexa -- may only hint at how Amazon thinks it can   transform our lives in the future.Dividend heroesHistorically, stocks that pay dividends outperform their   non-dividend paying peers, and because IRAs are tax-advantaged,   those dividend payments can compound over time and potentially   boost your retirement nest egg.As a refresher, traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax   dollars, and dividends paid to investors on investments held in   traditional IRAs aren't taxed until they're withdrawn in   retirement. Alternatively, a Roth IRA is funded with after-tax   dollars, so dividends paid on investments held in them may never   be subject to income taxes, as long as you follow the rules   regarding withdrawals. Additionally, unlike traditional IRAs,   investors don't have to make withdrawals from a Roth IRA during   their lifetime, so owningdividend   stocksin Roth IRAs can really make a lot of sense.If income investing sounds like your cup of tea, one way to go   about owning dividend-paying companies in your IRA is to buy theProshares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF(NYSEMKT: NOBL) . This ETF owns about 50 mid- and large-sized   companies that have increased their dividend for at least 25   consecutive years. If you buy this ETF, you'll gain exposure to   household names likeClorox,McDonald's, andWalgreens Boots Alliance. You'll also get exposure to many lesser-known top dividend   stocks like steelmakerNucor, Inc.Buying a bargainWhen it comes to buying value stocks, I'm a fan of buying   top-notch companies at fair prices. Thus, it may not be   surprising that I think investors should own top-shelf healthcare   stocks in their IRA, likePfizer, Inc.(NYSE: PFE) .With over $50 billion in sales and about $15 billion in   adjusted income annually, Pfizer is a world-class leader in drug   development and marketing, and since 76 million baby boomers are   getting older and living longer, the demographic argument for   owning Pfizer's shares is compelling.Admittedly, drugmakers have gotten a lot of bad press lately   because of their decisions on drug prices, but that bad press   means investors can get this top stock at a 12% discount to its   price last summer. Importantly, because new drugs and savvy   acquisitions are fueling growth, rising earnings means investors   are only paying about 12 times forward earnings estimates to buy   Pfizer's shares.Pfizer's dividend is another reason why this stock could be a   smart buy for an IRA. Last year, the company returned $12 billion   to investors via share buybacks and dividends, and in December,   Pfizer's board of directors declared a $0.32 first-quarter   dividend that's 7% higher than last year. With a healthy dividend   yield of 3.93%, I think this stock makes a lot of sense for IRAs.10 stocks we like better than PfizerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Does Thinking About Your IRA Give You Heartburn? Let Us Help;2/17/2017;"An IRA is a fantastic retirement saving tool, but many   Americans don't take advantage of it, and when they do, they fail   to make the most of it. If you're among them, don't worry. Here   are some rules to help you build a bigger nest egg with an   IRA.What are IRAs?As a refresher, you can get big tax benefits by saving money   for retirement in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.In 2017, you can set aside up to $5,500 of your earnings in   either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA or a combination of the   two. If you're 50 years old or older, then you can save up to   $6,500 of your earnings in an IRA.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Traditional IRAs can be funded with pre-tax money, which means   that money you put in now isn't taxed at your current tax rate.   Instead, that money, and any future gains, are taxed when its   withdrawn. Because of this feature, traditional IRAs can make   sense if you think your income tax rate in retirement will belowerthan it is today.Alternatively, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money,   which means you're paying taxes on your contributions now so that   you can withdraw them -- and future gains -- tax-free in   retirement. Because of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make   sense if you expect your income tax rate in retirement to behigherthan it is today.Some important IRA withdrawal rulesIn the case of a traditional IRA, if you don't wait until   you're at least 59.5 years old, the IRS will charge you income   taxes on any money that you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty, unless   you qualify for an early withdrawal exemption (more on that in a   minute).In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions   tax-free at any age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA   has been established for at least five years. However, any gains   that you withdraw prior to reaching age 59.5 can be subject to   income tax and penalties.Both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs do allow penalty free,   early withdrawals in specific instances. A full list of these   exemptions can be foundhere, but the big ones to know about include purchasing a first home   (up to $10,000), or payingcollege tuitionfor you, or an immediate relative, such as a spouse or child. The   rules for taking advantage of these exemptions can be quite   complex, so make sure you consult a tax professional before   taking any early withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want   is a surprise at tax time!Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think   you'll need to withdraw contributions five or more years from   now, and you won't be 59.5 years old or qualify for an early   withdrawal exemption at that time.Navigating the IRA income capsIn order to qualify for a tax deduction on a traditional IRA   contribution, your modified adjusted gross income has to be below   set limits if you, or your spouse, are covered by a retirement   plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribute to a Roth IRA,   your modified adjusted gross income needs to be below set limits   too.Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job   at explaining adjusted income limits for IRA'shere, but in short, if you're single and you are covered by a   retirement plan at work, you can take the full deduction on a   traditional IRA contribution if your adjusted income is below   $62,000 in 2017. You can qualify for a partial deduction if your   adjusted income is between $62,000 and $72,000.If you're single, you can make a contribution to a Roth IRA as   long as your adjusted income is less than $118,000. You can make   a partial contribution if your adjusted income is between   $118,000 and $133,000.If you're married filing jointly and covered by a retirement   plan at work, then you can take a tax deduction on your   traditional IRA contribution, as long as your adjusted income is   below $99,000. A partial deduction is possible if your adjusted   income is between $99,000 and $119,000.If you're not covered by a plan at work but your spouse is,   then you can make a tax deductible contribution to traditional   IRA if your adjusted income is below $186,000 or a partial   deduction if your adjusted income is between $186,000 and   $196,000.If you're married filing jointly, you can contribute to a Roth   IRA as long as your adjusted income is below $184,000. A partial   contribution can be made if your income is between $184,000 and   $194,000.If you think you're close to these limits and you're unsure of   how to calculate your modified adjusted gross income, you can   read up on the subjecthere.How to invest in an IRAOnce you've contributed to an IRA, you'll need to pick some   investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think   carefully about your age, your health, and the number of years   you have until you begin withdrawals.If you're young, in good health, and have plenty of years to   ride out the inevitable recession, then an IRA that includes   stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual funds can make sense.   Usually, buying and holding stocks and ETFs for long periods of   time is cheaper than buying an actively managed mutual fund, so   make sure that you balance the potential return, risk, and   expenses associated with these choices.Some investors may prefer owning individual stocks for the   long term, such as disruptive growth companies likeAmazonorAlphabet. Other investors may prefer owning an S&P 500 ETF that   tracks the stock market's returns more closely. If so, a low-cost   S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is theVanguardS&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . It has an annual expense ratio of just   0.05%.It may also pay off to own dividend-paying stocks in an IRA.   Because IRAs offer tax advantages, dividend payments can compound   over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially   tax-free. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed   non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the performance ofdividend   stockstends to be lower during periods of rising interest rates, when   they have to compete with bonds for income investors'   attention.Overall, building a diversified IRA that includes exposure to   stocks and stock ETFs can provide financial security in   retirement. For example, if you're 30, and you contribute $5,500   per year for 35 years and earn a hypothetical 6% return per year,   then you'll have a nest egg valued at $612,886 at age 65. That's   not chump change, so make sure that you take advantage of this   powerful savings tool.The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees   completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)   behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known   ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your   retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as   much as $16,122 more... each year!

VMware, Inc. (VMW) Keeps the Momentum Going;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) may not be one of the first companies that comes to mind when you're thinking about cloud services stocks. But, it should be.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrBelieve it or not, VMW is one of the top enterprise cloud services and virtualization companies out there. And, its growth up to now, while impressive, is just the beginning. In the past 12 months, VMW stock has almost doubled.That sounds compelling, but the underlying story is what makes VMW's rise something you should understand, especially if you're looking for exposure in this massively disruptive market.Simply put, cloud computing means that your computer doesn't need to have individual software packages for each specific job you want it to do. In the old days, you ran a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, a design program, etc. And, every machine had to have its individual software suite.The rise of networked computers meant that all of this software could be stored on a network ""library"" and each user could access what they needed.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe next iteration of these networks were housed in the ""cloud,"" which simply implies a virtual space built into servers. One of the primary advantages is the ability to access your information from the cloud, regardless of where you are or what computer you're using.Cloud computing has been around for a long time, and companies such asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have been using the cloud for many years.Now, companies of all sizes are migrating to the cloud, and within the cloud universe there both public clouds (where many people have access) and private clouds (where only select people have access). VMW provides the ability to develop each of these systems, and also facilitates unique access between public and private clouds.Why Don't We Hear Much About VMware?VMWare is actually owned byDell Technologies Inc(NYSE:DVMT) subsidiary,EMC Corporation(NYSE:EMC). Last April, Dell bought EMC to become the largest privately-held tech company in the world. So, VMWare is a cloud-based, publicly-traded branch of this major tech player now.Part of the reason you don't hear about VMWare as much as its competitors is because the company's relationship to its owners is a bit convoluted, and analysts aren't very confident in figuring out how to value VMW stock. Their loss is your gain.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideQ4 and full-year numbers were posted in late January, and they show how strong VMW stock remains. Earnings beat analyst expectations and revenue continued to grow at a solid clip. A new strategic partnership with AMZN's cloud-computing juggernaut, Amazon Web Services (AWS), adds some serious firepower to the VMW arsenal. It also helps the company remain competitive in a very dynamic field.When you have a tech parent like EMC and a tech partner like AWS, you are doing very well. These brands are major players in the enterprise sector and will open even more doors for VMW in the future. VMWare stock is on a significant growth trajectory that should last years, not months.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) may not be competitors, but you can trade them as if they are. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();I am a fundamentally driven trader. Meaning I like to set my risk based on solid fundamentals. Tesla and Twitter are both perceived as risky bets. This is not a slight against either of them; I am merely saying that their fundamentals have yet to grow into their valuations. Tesla has a few obstacles ahead it. I get the potential but for now it's a speculative play in my book.A few days ago I suggestedclosing TSLA long profits and roll into TWTR longs. I did so because I didn't have room for both speculative trades in my portfolio. The move turned out to be an instant win as that day marked the high in TSLA and a coincided with a spike in TWTR.Click to EnlargeTesla Stock has a cult following. But on Thursday it caught a downgrade that caused a 3.9% drop.It won't be long before TSLA fans start touting great entry points. Personally, I reiterate my skepticism in its fundamentals so I won't be buying the stock.3 Dow Jones Stocks That Are Weighing You DownOn the other hand, I remain a fan of the TSLA stock price action. So, I like selling risk in Tesla options.I am always looking for opportunities to cautiously catch the falling knife. The easiest way I can do it is by repeating what has worked in TSLA, which is to sell risk against extreme opinions. I am not reckless so I always leave plenty of room for error since I never assume that I will pick the perfect time of entry. In this case, I will nibble with a first tranche trade then add to it as price unfolds.The Trade:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $11.50 to open. The 30% price buffer gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success. My breakeven point is $173.5 per share. Selling naked puts is dangerous and is not suitable for all investors especially on a speculative high-priced stock. So I can modify this trade to carry less overall dollars at risk.The Alternate:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185/$180 credit put spread. For this collect $1 to open. If successful, this trade yields more than 25% on money risked. Selling a spread limits my maximum risk to the width of the spread less what I collect to open.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Ready for a BreakoutI am not required to carry these trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses. Selling naked puts is dangerous especially in markets hovering at all time highs.

Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling Now;2/17/2017;"Warren Buffett loves buying great stocks at fair prices, but   he doesn't hold onto every stock he buys forever. Sometimes,   he'll sell stocks after he's made a healthy profit. Other times,   he'll sell because something has changed to make the company less   attractive to him.Knowing what stocks Buffett's selling can be important because   his investment company,Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) , is so big that when he sells, it   can cause share prices to drop. That's a risk investors might not   want to take!Luckily, Berkshire Hathaway files a 13F report with the SEC   every quarter that shows exactly what he's been selling, and that   can keep you from being unhappily surprised. For   example, Buffett sold shares inWal-Mart Stores(NYSE: WMT) ,Deere & Co.(NYSE: DE)  andVerizon(NYSE: VZ)  in Q4. Should you sell those stocks too?makeArticleAd();Bailing on bricks and mortarWarren Buffett has been a longtime owner of Wal-Mart Stores,   but he's been selling shares in the retail giant since last   spring, and in Q4, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in   Wal-Mart by 89% to 1.4 million shares.Image source: Wal-Mart Stores.One reason Buffett may be selling Wal-Mart is because the   company has been under fire from online retailers, and   maintaining market share against those retailers has been   hard.Wal-Mart is nowhere near as troubled as some other traditional   retailers, but retail sales figures, and Wal-Mart's own   financials suggest Wal-Mart's best days may be behind it.   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce industry revenue   jumped 15.7% year over year in Q3, 2016, and it now represents   8.4% of total retail sales.Wal-Mart's most recent quarterly earnings report from November   shows investors just how tough its been to compete against online   retailers likeAmazon.com. In Wal-Mart's fiscal third quarter, its sales grew by an anemic   0.7% to $118.2 billion, and through the first nine months of   fiscal 2017, its sales also grew by just 0.7% to $355   billion. For perspective, consider that Amazon.com's net   sales surged 27% to $136.0 billion in 2016. Based on that   comparison alone, it's understandable why Buffett no longer wants   Wal-Mart to be one of his biggest holdings.Farming for profitWarren Buffett was betting that Deere & Co. could   recapture some of luster last year, and it seems the farm   machinery maker lived up to his expectations.Deere & Co.'s shares came into 2016 trading in the $70's.   But, after a big run up, they finished the year trading at over   $100. With Deere's shares rallying to all-time highs, it appears   Buffett decided not to push his luck. In the third quarter, he   sold 874,185 shares, and in the fourth quarter, he sold his   remaining 21.1 million shares.It's anyone's guess if Warren Buffett will buy shares in Deere   & Co. again, but if he does, it's probably not going to be   for a while, unless of course, Deere's shares sell-off, or farm   income climbs. In 2016, farm income was the lowest since the   recession, and that caused Deere's net revenue to fall 8% to   $26.6 billion.Deere & Co.'s ability to turn a profit despite slowing   equipment demand is impressive, but the outlook for 2017 doesn't   provide a lot of conviction to buy Deere's shares at lofty   levels. The USDA net farm income forecast for this year puts it   at the lowest levels since 2002, and Deere is projecting that   equipment sales will dip by another 1% in 2017. Thus, Deere   & Co. may be worth buying only if share prices retreat    Until then, patience is probably best.Wrong numberVerizon may be the country's biggest wireless carrier, but   that fact alone wasn't enough to keep Warren Buffett a   shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway sold almost all of its stake in   Verizon last quarter.We may never know exactly why Buffett soured on Verizon, but   since Buffett has ownedVerizon sharessince the middle of 2014, it's possible, depending on the exact   timing of his buys and sells, that he was able to book a   double-digit percentage profit on his investment in Verizon, and   if so, then that gain might have been enough to convince him to   sell into growing industry uncertainty.Last year, Verizon decided to buyYahoo!to merge it with its AOL business, but after a high-profile data   breach, pressure has mounted for that deal to be renegotiated to   reflect damage to Yahoo!'s brand. Rumors are that Yahoo! may   agree to a $250 million haircut to appease Verizon, but even at   that lower price, it's not a given that this deal will be a big   win.Adding to Verizon's uncertainty is the fact that it might   need to do more deals just to keep pace withAT&T. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, and this week,Time Warnershareholders approved AT&T's $85 billion acquisition offer.   As competitors push deeper into video, Verizon could have to make   its own big splash, and that could be costly. Depending on how   costly, that could be enough to send investors to the sidelines.10 stocks we like better than Verizon   CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

In this visual computing space, Big Data, virtual reality (VR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are three major disruptive forces that lean heavily on quality rendering and fast processing.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteSimply put, Big Data packages large data sets and then analyzes them to find any discernible patterns or trends. For example, a store can figure out what day and time is best for 30-something women to buy a shirt. Visualizing these data sets is very helpful in analyzing this process.VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are not only the hottest technologies in gaming, but are already revolutionizing other fields where interaction is highly prized. For example, medical schools are using AR tech to virtually operate on an augmented cadaver, rather than physically operating on one. The possibilities are just being tapped at this point.IoT is another technology in its infancy. As artificial intelligence and bandwidth merge, opportunities are appearing everywhere, for instance in ""smart"" cars, homes, offices, you name it. One of the best examples nowadays isAmazon.com, Inc's(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa orAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home device, where you can do everything from order a pizza to set your thermostat just by talking to the thing. It recognizes your commands and then, through its connectivity, turns your request into reality.NVDA is already working with many major car companies to create the next-generation car dashboard, as well as other interactive possibilities. It is helping scientists manipulate molecules and atoms to build better drugs. And, it's building the chips that are featured in the newest gaming system fromNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY).These are just a few reasons that NVDA is up 282% in the past 12 months.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeservePart of this big move was because the entire semiconductor industry was weak because demand had slackened. But, this is a cyclical industry and it's ""game on"" once again. Plus, NVDA has shown that it's more than just a graphics card maker at this point. It is on the leading edge of the next generation of visual computing.NVDA numbers for Q4 were recently released, and the stock came down from its 52-week highs on the news.But, this is simply the pause that refreshes. The numbers were still impressive and there is significant untapped growth for NVDA stock. Management's guidance may have been slightly conservative, but it's likely that stellar growth will remain in Nvidia's future for many years to come.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Sorry, Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Not a Short!;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock isn't cheap, to be sure. Even with TWLO more than 50% off late September highs, the stock still trades at over seven times the midpoint of its 2017 revenue guidance. And that multiple excludes the company's $300 million in cash. Meanwhile, the price-earnings ratio for Twilio stock is infinite because the company is unprofitable, and rather sharply so. 2017 guidance implies an operating loss of $13 million to $17 million on a non-GAAP basis.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrIn other words, for every dollar of revenue Twilio generates this year, it expects to lose at least 4 cents, plus another 3 to 4 cents in stock-based compensation. (That dilution is excluded from Twilio stock's non-GAAP figures.)So ifAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is overvalued at 62 times earnings, TWLO stock must be even moreso. And that should make Twilio stock a tempting target for short sellers.But it's not that simple. TWLO is a growth stock after all, and growth stocks can stay elevated for a long time. Short sellers indeed have targeted TWLO stock, one reason shares have declined so sharply of late. But as those same short sellers say, ""Valuation is not a catalyst."" And recent history proves them right.Yes, The Numbers MatterValue investors, in particular, often criticize stocks like TWLO, with more than a bit of frustration in their voice. ""I guess, for growth stocks, the numbers don't even matter."" (AMZN shareholders surely are familiar with that sentiment.)The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverBut that's not the case. A company like Twilio isn'tsupposedto be profitable yet. It's not even a decade old, which isn't a long time in the competitive tech space. It's investing money in attracting new customers to its cloud communications service, which is what it should be doing. There's no need to forego that spend for profits now, when that spend can drive far more profits later.Purely from a valuation standpoint, it's too simplistic, particularly in the PaaS/SaaS space, to look at profits without context. It's better for Twilio to spend a dollar on sales and marketing now - even if that adds to its net losses - if that dollar is worth $3 in sales later. And the reason cloud stocks have been so hyped - and so highly valued - is that $1 upfront doesn't just lead to $3 later … Rather, it leads to $1, or even $2,  for years and years and years.So there are investors who are taking the long term - and, dare I say, fundamental - approach toward Twilio stock. TWLO's valuation is based not on what it's doing in 2017, but what it can do in 2020, or 2025. That leads to quite a bit of volatility, as seen in TWLO's short time on the public markets. But that volatility doesn't mean TWLO longs aren't paying attention, and it doesn't mean TWLO is failing. Most notably, for short sellers considering TWLO, it doesn't mean Twilio stock willkeepgoing down.Sentiment MattersOf course, there are fundamental arguments for TWLO stock to continue to tumble. Unlike more well-known cloud plays, Twilio has relatively low gross margins since it still has to pay network providers who transmit calls and text messages. Revenue growth is guided to slow in 2017, to 33%.With similar deceleration, sales wouldn't double again until 2020. $700 million-plus in sales at even 15% operating margin still implies barely $100 million in operating profit. That, in turn, probably puts EPS under $1 - and TWLO stock's 2020 P/E multiple above 35.But investors should look at recent history in the cloud space. Pretty much every high-flying SaaS or PaaS stock has had similar concerns. And pretty much all of them have held up just fine.Workday Inc(NYSE:WDAY) bottomed in early 2016 near $50; it's since rebounded sharply, and now trades at over 10x revenue.Veeva Systems Inc(NYSE:VEEV) was a popular short seller target in 2015; it's at all-time highs, with sales multiples similar to that of TWLO.Splunk Inc(NASDAQ:SPLK) is near a 52-week high - and trades at over 8x revenue on an enterprise basis. A high valuation doesn't mean a bad stock - at least in the short term.Bottom Line on TWLO StockSo there are two concerns when shorting a stock like TWLO. The first is that as long as near-term performance is enough to keep bullish investors happy on the long-term prospects, the stock is unlikely to come down. With Twilio coming out of a strong Q4 that beat expectations, that sentiment seems likely to stay positive for at least the next couple of months.The second is that a short seller on TWLO can be right and still lose badly. ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,"" the old saw goes. But the market also can berationaland just flat-out wrong. A short seller, however, only profits when the market realizes it's wrong. And that can take a long time.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Ready for a BreakoutTo be sure, short sellers continue to target Twilio stock. But it's a dangerous game. Just ask short sellers of WDAY, VEEV, SPLK or, most notably, AMZN. Timing is key. And right now, the timing does not look right, at all, for a short of Twilio stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Dow Jones Stocks That Are Weighing You Down3 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy That Will Energize Your PortfolioThe postSorry, Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Not a Short!appeared first onInvestorPlace."
WWDC 2017: Here’s What Apple Inc. Might Reveal;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced the date for its yearly developer conference. WWDC 2017 will take place in San Jose, starting on June 5. What can you expect the company to announce at the Apple event?makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAs a developer conference, Apple usually focuses on software at its June events and WWDC 2017 will follow the same pattern.The company likes to offer hints at what its upcoming operating system releases hold with demos during the keynote presentation.With the iPhone dominating Apple's bottom line, iOS 11 - the next version of AAPL's mobile operating system - is bound to get the majority of the stage time.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Isn't Coming Back. Just Ask Buffett.You can expect to see the latest versions of Apple's other operating systems to be shown off as well. We'll find out which California geographical feature macOS 10.13 will be named after, along with the latest new features for Mac users. Apple Watch's watchOS and the Apple TV's tvOS will also get mentions.WWDC 2017: What About the Hardware?Software is exciting to app developers. For everyone else, maybe not so much, especially when it's just a teaser or dives into technical details. What really gets people's attention - especially from an Apple event - is new hardware. AAPL doesn't put an emphasis on revealing new products on stage at these developer conferences, but there have been exceptions, including:Mac Pro at WWDC 2006iPhone 3G at WWDC 200813-inch MacBook Pro and iPhone 3GS at WWDC 2009iPhone 4 at WWDC 2010MacBook Pro with Retina Display WWDC 2012New Mac Pro at WWDC 2013Historically speaking, we may be overdue for a hardware announcement and there are two possibilities that come into mind for WWDC 2017.WWDC 2017: iPhone 8?It's been many years since AAPL chose its summer Apple event to take the wraps off a new iPhone. It's a long shot, but there's a possibility the company may choose WWDC 2017 to unveil the iPhone 8. Why?First, there's the significance of the June conference date. 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and the very first one first went on sale in June, 2007. Then there are the rumors that Apple is planning toramp up iPhone 8 production in June, which would be earlier than usual.But the most compelling reason why the company might show off the iPhone 8 early is the developers in attendance. We're pretty sure AAPL is going to make sweeping changes to the iPhone 8. Besides design changes, that could mean anything from an optical scanner to a mini version of the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar replacing the Home button.The company will want apps available at launch that make use of any new hardware and that means bringing developers into the loop early. Apple may decide to let the cat out of the bag at WWDC 2017 so developers have a chance to learn about the new features and capabilities.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingAnother possibility on the hardware front is a revamped Apple TV. AAPL has been struggling with its set-top streamer with sales once again dropping off. It recently hired the former head ofAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV division tohelp turn around the Apple TV's fortunes. One of the big missing pieces from the Apple TV is relatively easy to fix. A new box with 4K support would address the issue of being stuck in the 1080p era when everyone else is doing Ultra HD, and it's possible Apple could have this ready for June.Of course, we have a few months to wait until we find out for sure. Watch InvestorPlace for coverage of WWDC 2017. Once the keynote wraps up on June 5, we'll be posting on all the major Apple event reveals.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAmazon.com, Inc.

This Is the Biggest Risk Facing Costco;2/17/2017;"Costco(NASDAQ: COST) has been remarkably steady in a climate where   other retailers have struggled as more consumers move at least   some of their shopping online.That's at least partly because whileAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and other digital retailers may offer comparable   (or even better pricing) they can't equal the warehouse club's   shopping experience. Certainly many consumers go to Costco   because of price, but others shop there because of the fun of   discovering what deal may be offered that day or what   limited-time seasonal merchandise may be on the chain's no-frill   shelves.Of course, some people also visit the warehouse club because   of the free samples, while others enjoy the ability to get a   cheap meal before or after shopping. It's a mix that has kept the   chain growing despite it having a very limited online   business.makeArticleAd();Costco posted a decent 3% increase in United States comparable   store sales inDecember 2016and a fairly impressive 6% gain inJanuary 2017. Those may not be Amazon-like growth numbers, but they are   increases that the vast majority of retailers would be thrilled   to have.The problem the chain faces -- and it's a big risk going   forward -- is that people are shopping in stores less and less.   Eventually it's possible, maybe even probable, that Costco's   immunity to this trend -- which has impacted so many other   retailers -- will end.Image source:YCharts.com.Where are people shopping?While it may feel like a massive amount of the total retail   sales have moved online, in reality, digital sales only accounted   for 8.4% of all sales in Q3 2016, according to data from the U.S.   Census Bureau. The problem for retailers, as you can see on the   chart above, is that the number has been steadily climbing.The Q3 2016 data represents a full 1% increase year-over-yer   from Q3 2015. Online sales have not made massive gains each year,   but consumers are migrating and given the increased ease of   buying things online, there's every reason to believe the trend   will not only continue, but accelerate.Those increases may not impact Costco at first but they are   clearly hurting other retailers. A number of chains including   Sports Authority, Linens-N-Things, Borders Books, Circuit City,   and others have gone out of business over the past few years   while a handful of top names are teetering on the edge in   2017.It's possible that some of those losses actually have helped   Costco, but at some point the death of physical retailers will   push more consumers online. With less physical shopping choices   consumers may simply decide that shopping is something they   mostly do online and some, maybe many, could fall out of the   Costco habit.As other retailers close Costco could gain customers or     people could decide to shop online more. Image source: Getty     Images.How can Costco fight this?The warehouse club chain has committed to beefing up its   digital presence and it has shown some strong early results. On a   global basis in Q1 2017, ""total online sales were up 8% in the   quarter and 7% on a comp basis,"" according to CFO Richard Galanti   in the company's earnings call with investors. The CFO also   pointed out that during the week of Thanksgiving and the two that   followed, digital sales rose by the low-to-mid teens.Galanti reiterated that the company would be investing in   improving the digital experience by doing things like making it   easier to check out and improving the returns process. Growing   digital sales is a small hedge against customers shopping in   stores less, but most consumers are not likely to stay Costco   members, paying $55 or $110 a year, to mostly shop at a   website.For Costco to deal with the risk posed by the declining amount   of money being spent overall in physical stores it must invest in   making sure its warehouses remain destinations. That means   increasing spending on everything from sampling to making sure   its in-house restaurants remain a very cheap way to eat a meal or   snack. The chain has to expand its focus on making people want to   come to its stores because as they buy more and more online it   could become harder to get them to leave the house just to   shop.10 stocks we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Ready for a Breakout;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Thursday, Feb. 16, shares ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) once again got very close to a breakout above their 2016 highs. Thus, Amazon stock caught my eye for a trade setup that could lead traders to topple over each other while chasing the stock higher. Traders and investors would be wise to keep a close eye on AMZN stock again in coming days and weeks.makeArticleAd();Some of the highest probability trades in my eye occur when many market participants are positioned the 'wrong' way and a stock begins to turn, thus quickly forcing traders to reverse their bets. This often leads to explosive moves in stocks higher or lower.This phenomenon often occurs at critical turnaround points in the broader stock indices when they become heavily oversold. When most traders have turned bearish and the market no longer has any sellers left, the path of least resistance goes to the upside, leading short sellers to cover their bets and see the market rocket higher.AMZN Stock ChartsSimilar setups occur in single name stocks at both oversold and overbought conditions as well as around critical breakout or breakdown points. AMZN stock currently finds itself at such a technical juncture where a squeeze higher to fresh all-time highs could soon occur, which in turn, may force skeptics to chase the stock higher at all cost.Click to EnlargeOn the multi-year weekly chart, we see that Amazon stock's ascent over the last few years albeit steep has come in an orderly fashion where periods of consolidation were followed by breakouts.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverNote that the yellow 50-week simple moving average held the stock as support in early 2016 and again in November that year. Although upside momentum has been making lower highs ever since the momentum high in late 2015, there is hope for momentum to begin turning higher again soon.Click to EnlargeOn the daily chart, we see that following the early February earnings report, AMZN stock shot lower, but that this sell-off was capped at a one-day event. After a few days of pausing, Amazon stock resumed its push higher and earlier this week, it revisited its pre-earnings report highs. Note that this current juncture also coincides with the previous all-time highs in AMZN stock from October 2016. From here, there is no need to over-complicate things. A break and hold above $848 could open up the next upside target for Amazon stock around the $880 area.Like what you see?

What's in Store for The TJX Companies (TJX) in Q4 Earnings?;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();The TJX Companies Inc.TJXis set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Feb 22, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.6%.The question lingering in investors' minds now is, whether TJX Companies will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, TJX Companies has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.87%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.00, reflecting a year-over-year gain of 1.35%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $9.47 billion, increasing 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.TJX Companies forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. As per the latestEarnings Preview, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline marginally by 1%, while revenue is projected to improve by 4.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTJX Companies is one of the few retailers which have managed to stay afloat amid troubled waters of the retail sector. In fact, the shares of TJX Companies have declined 1% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks categorizedRetail Wholesalesector which has witnessed a decline of 3% in the same time frame. Most of the retailers are losing their market share to the online giant Amazon.com Inc.AMZNas more and more buyers are opting for the convenience of buying through the internet.TJX Companies has been posting modest earnings and revenue growth in the past few quarters driven by improvement in consumer traffic, higher margins and solid comparable-store sales growth.The company has reported positive comps growth in the past 30 quarters supported by higher traffic. Its fresh collection and widespread sourcing machinery has helped it maintain a loyal customer base. The trend is anticipated to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS SurpriseTJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise|TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, The TJX Companies is also taking steps to rejuvenate its loyalty program. The program has been a huge success with approximately 8 million members enrolled already. Moreover, during the third quarter company has added special rewards for key segments of the program. This is expected to boost sales in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company is anticipated to witness a dip in margins owing to higher wages paid to laborers as announced earlier in fiscal 2016. Moreover, foreign exchange remains a concern due to weakening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar is expected to affect the fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.Based on the guidance issued during third-quarter fiscal 2017 conference call, TJX anticipates earnings in the range of 96-98 cents per share compared with 99 cents reported a year ago. For the fourth quarter, the company expects comps growth of 1-2% over last year's strong 6% increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TJX is likely to beat earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to surpass earnings estimates. However, that is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP for TJX is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.00. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:TJX currently has a Zacks Rank #3. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the retail companies that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Dollar Tree Inc.DLTRwith an Earnings ESP of +0.75% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Heading to $160 on Video Capabilities;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking excuses to not likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and avoiding FB stock is just plain dumb. Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, I gave FB stock a Strong Buy rating with a 12-monthprice target of $150. With the earnings report now in behind us, I'm inclined to raise that target to $160.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIndeed, FB stock is no bargain when shares are near all-time highs, but the company's revenue growth engines are certain to significantly impact the bottom line. Although management didn't scale back on plans to increase capital spending, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the social media giant was aiming for shorter-form content, has made clear that FB intends to dominate video, which is where the bulk of its capex will go.And, that spending has already begun.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Last week Facebook hired Mina Lefevre, former head of scripted development atViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIA). This hire can only be for one reason: to increase Facebook's transition toward developing original content. Contrary to popular opinion, Zuckerberg is not pushing Facebook to become a television network, nor does he envision the company competing withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). His drive to become a ""video-first"" company has everything to do with selling more ads.From my vantage point, the reason Facebook must spend money is because it has begun to experience a problem thatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) craves: It has run out of ad space on its news feeds. But, Facebook doesn't want to sacrifice the user experience without first knowing what sorts of videos users will want to see - and how to make them less intrusive.To that end, Lefevre, whose track record at Viacom-owned MTV Networks includes producing teen-focused content, is a solid hire. To the extent Facebook's shorter-form content can put it into the realm ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertising juggernaut YouTube, it would have been money well spent.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeIn that regard, given Zuckerberg's Midas-like qualities, it would be a mistake to avoid FB stock solely on the fears of high capex. It would make more sense to focus on the return Facebook can realize from its investments.Bottom Line for FB StockFacebook - as it promised in the third quarter - has signaled that it will be in a period of transition. Investors, however, are now taking their time to see how the increased spending balances out with management's warning of slow ad growth. While this might put FB stock in limbo, now is also the time to look at the big picture. And my crystal ball says to own FB stock, don't trade it, and wait for $160.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Labor Issues Could Cause Problems for TSLA Stock;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is pulling back after nearing all-time highs, and it's possible that concerns about Tesla's labor force are part of the reason for the modest decline in TSLA stock. Last week, it was reported that TSLA factory workers had contacted the United Auto Workers about creating a union.makeArticleAd();Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)One Tesla workerposted an essay online, criticizing working conditions at the company's facility in Fremont, California. Tesla CEO Elon Musk replied angrily, stating that,""I find this attack to be morally outrageous.""For its part, the UAW has said that the decision to create a union is up to Tesla workers.Fundamentally, the impact of a potential Tesla union on TSLA stock likely won't be very significant - at least not directly. But, the kerfuffle over unionization highlights the potential political pitfalls that Musk and Tesla must navigate. In an increasingly polarized country, consumers are starting to act like voters - every day, and that implies some potential risks for Tesla stock.The Fundamental Impact of a Tesla Union on Tesla StockIt's tough to parse out what a Tesla union would do to TSLA earnings. Management doesn't break out precise wages, for instance. But, we can get close to a reasonable estimate. In 2014,Tesla told the state of Nevadathat its Gigafactory would employ 6,500 employees, with annual total wages of $353 million.The company has almost the same number of workers (6,200) at its Fremont plant, according to a December report, with plans to expand that plant and add another 3,100 jobs. A rough assumption that wages are relatively similar would imply that (post-expansion) potential Tesla union workers would earn at least $500 million per year in wages.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveConsidering Tesla's current shipment status, that's a large sum. Trailing 12-month sales are less than $6 billion. But, even with TSLA stock based on where Tesla is going, a wage hike could justify a material change to TSLA's valuation. Even a 20% hike would add $100 million-plus in costs, or approximately $65 million per year after tax. That's roughly 40 cents per TSLA share per year;at a 30x multiple, higher wages could take as much as $12 off the fair value of Tesla stock.However, that's an imperfect estimate for a number of reasons. Tesla's focus on technology likely means the company will require fewer workers over time. Plus, TSLA can find other costs to cut to offset wage pressure, as many companies do.Still, fundamentally, there is reason to believe that a Tesla union could have a modest impact on Tesla stock. It doesn't look like unionization would ruin the company, as some commentators believe happened toFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) before the financial crisis. But, there is the possibility of a Tesla union having an impact on long-term earnings, and, as such, the long-term price of TSLA stock.The Perception of Tesla and Tesla StockWhere the issue gets dicier for Tesla, in my opinion, is relative to the company's perception. Since last year's presidential election, consumers increasingly vote their politics with their pocketbooks. Liberals against President Donald Trump have boycottedAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Macy's Inc(NYSE:M) (including subsidiary Bloomingdale's, Inc.) and many others.Conservatives have shunnedPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP),Kellogg Company(NYSE:K) and a myriad of other companies, including Amazon. (Evidently, though, the AMZN boycotts aren't holding very strongly.)That leaves Musk, and Tesla, in a tough spot. This isn't the first time TSLA has faced reports of underpaying its labor. Last May,The Mercury Newsreported that the companypaid workers a mere $5 per hourduring a construction project. Management responded by pointing out that it hadpaid its subcontractor $55 per hourfor the labor. And, of course, there was yet another political storm when Musk met with President Trump soon after the inauguration, despite howls of protest from some supporters.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe catch for both Tesla and TSLA stock is that the company can't divorce itself from politics. It's a ""green"" company, which draws admiration from the left. It is emphatic in its intent to be ""Made in America,"" which likely endears the company to Trump. But, Tesla and Musk need to walk the line very carefully to appeal to both groups.Bottom Line on TSLA StockA Tesla union could put Musk in a bit of a jam. He needs to keep the pro-labor left happy, while also protecting TSLA stock shareholders, and his company's cash as it builds out his infrastructure. Push too hard against the workforce, and liberals will see Musk as another heartless capitalist. Give too much, and investors will see Tesla as a company run for its employees, not its shareholders - and potentially the next 2008-era GM.It's a difficult dance, and if anyone can do it, it's likely Elon Musk. But, he will have to dance very carefully.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Beaten-Up Cheap Stocks: Are They Bargains?;2/16/2017;"The market is not a perfect value-weighing machine. Sometimes,   stocks trade at dirt-cheap or sky-high valuations for good   reason. In other cases, there's a plot twist just around the   corner and Mr. Market never sees it coming.Today, I'll take a look at three incredibly cheap stocks and   figure out whether their low valuations are reasonable or unfair.   The companies under the lens for examination areFitbit(NYSE: FIT) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , andMacy's(NYSE: M) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Fitbit has lost a stepFitbit shares have plunged a massive 57% lower in 52 weeks,   includinga 30% drop in a single daytriggered by weak fourth-quarter guidance.The stock is trading at just 14 times trailing earnings and   19% over Fitbit's book value. About 42% of all shares were sold   short a month ago, as if investors are waiting for the other shoe   to drop -- hard.So is this a dramatic overreaction that could lead to a   soaring bounce, or is Fitbit in serious trouble?In the latest earnings call, Fitbit CFO Bill Zarella admitted   that consumer demand for the company's health-monitor tools is   softer than expected. The company is a leader in a once-promising   market, but the market opportunity is turning out to be smaller   than Fitbit thought.In other words, today's step counters and pulse trackers might   just be a fad without staying power. It's quite possible that a   real market for these features won't emerge until the hardware   can be found as a freebie in your next cereal box, or thrown in   as a no-cost bonus in another product. If so, there's no real   value to be found in fitness trackers -- at least none that will   stick around for the long haul.Fitbit's strongest asset is its solid balance sheet. Backing   out $3 of cash per share, the stock would actually be trading at   just 3.9 times trailing earnings. Armed with $672 million in cash   and short-term investments but no long-term debt at all, the   company has a few years' worth of financial support that lets   management take risks and try drastic strategy shifts in order to   relight the growth fires.Personally, I would hardly back up the truck to the Fitbit   window. A small, speculative investment might be appropriate   because the company might be able to find new markets. I could   also be wrong about the faddish nature of fitness trackers.But one-hit wonders never catch a second wind, and I wouldn't   be surprised to see Fitbit falling into that wistful category. If   Fitbit is a bargain, it's a terribly risky one. Keep your buys   small, and be fully prepared to lose it all. This is a gamble,   not an investment.First Solar is waiting for a moment in the sunLike Fitbit, First Solar has seen share prices crashing in   recent months. The stock has plunged 43% lower in 52 weeks. Also   like Fitbit, this stock is objectively cheap -- First Solar   trades at just seven times trailing earnings, or 2.7 if you back   out $20 of net cash per share from the share price. Furthermore,   both companies used to sport rambunctious sales growth figures,   but have slowed down considerably in recent years.But that's where the similarities end.Rather than a potential fad, First Solar works in a field of   explosive growth opportunities. Solar production and installation   costshave fallen 90% in a decade, making the technology a serious alternative to oil, coal, and   natural gas. First Solar's stalled sales growth will continue in   2017, or maybe even turn negative for a variety of political and   operational reasons. But the long-term value here is undeniable,   and First Solar is a proven leader in this industry.Solar stocks in general are primed for a rebound today -- andFirst Solar more so than most.Yes, this is a genuine bargain. You can quote me on that.Macy's bricks-and-mortar messRetail veteran Macy's can't quite match First Solar's or   Fitbit's extreme one-year market drops, but share prices have   indeed plunged 55% lower in about 18 months. The fall of 2015 was   not kind to Macy's investors.Mind you, 2016 really should have roughed the stock up even   further. Here's why:M Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.Macy's has seen its revenue sliding south over the last four   quarters, which wouldn't be a huge problem if profit margin was   on the rise. Instead, the store chain's profitability is   plunging. Managementrecently closed down 100 locations, even in profitable markets. Same-store sales fell over the   holidays. There isn't much good to say about Macy's these days.   Like most of its bricks-and-mortar peers, the retailer is   fighting for its life against online retailers led byAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .This company does seem open to trying new ideas, such as the   Backstage discount-store-within-a-store concept or the   smaller-sized BlueMercury beauty outlets. But the age of big-box   retailers is drawing to a close, and none of these admirable   moves will do much to delay the inevitable.Macy's had better embrace the online retail market   wholeheartedly, before it's too late. A handful of old-line   department stores will make it, but most will die defending the   outdated business models they hold too dear to kill.Sadly, Macy's seems destined for the great outlet store in the   sky unless management makes some drastic attitude changes.   Management still insists that the in-store experience always will   form an effective weapon against online sellers. The company's   financial reports don't even break out online sales so they can   be discussed or analyzed.It's not too late to turn the sinking ship around, but it'd be   an unlikely and difficult turnaround battle -- and Macy's isn't   even thinking about the core problem in the right terms yet.   Until further notice, then, Macy's low share price is more of a   falling knife than an inviting bargain.10 stocks we like better than First SolarWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What's in Store for Wal-Mart (WMT) This Earnings Season?;2/16/2017;"Retail giantWal-Mart Stores Inc.WMT, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 21. The question lingering in investors' minds is, whether the company will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 5.1%.Wal-Mart forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest ZacksEarnings Preview, we note that the above mentioned sector's earnings growth looks disappointing. Total earnings for the sector are estimated to decline 1.0%, while revenues are projected to improve 4.8%.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseWal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteLet's delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let's look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at $1.30, down 12.8% from $1.49 delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $130.9 billion, up 1% from the prior-year period.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Wal-Mart is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positiveEarnings ESPfor this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Wal-Mart has an Earnings ESP of 0.77% as both the Most Accurate estimate of $1.31 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. The company has a positive ESP, which increases the predictive power of earnings beating estimates. However, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, it is to be noted that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Influencing the QuarterWal-Mart has been striving to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence and boost sales. It has delivered positive comps in the U.S. in the last nine quarters. Moreover, traffic improved for the eighth consecutive quarter, owing to the company's efforts to modernize stores for higher footfall and improvement in consumer spending. The company continues to expect positive comps year over year at Wal-Mart U.S. in fiscal 2017 results.Wal-Mart expects U.S. comp sales growth in the range of 1−1.5% for the 13-week period ending Jan 27. Sam's Club comp sales, without the impact of fuel sales, are expected in the range of 1−1.5% for the fourth quarter.Coming to the share price movement, Wal-Mart's shares have increased 4.2% in the past one year, little higher than the Zacks categorizedRetail-Supermarketsindustry's growth of 2.6%.While Wal-Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter, top line remains sluggish due to the deflationary pressure the industry is grappling with.Wal-Mart is also making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives to compete with the biggest online retailer, Amazon.comAMZN. The company is also making efforts to improve its customer service. In this regard, on Jan 31, the company started offering free two-day shipping to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 on over 2 million items and that too, without any membership fee.The company competes with Amazon's Prime shipping program, which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping with additional features like a streaming video service. This project will replace Wal-Mart's existing shipping program named 'Shipping Pass' that charge shoppers an annual membership fee of $49.In addition to offering two-day shipping to stores, Wal-Mart continues to offer same-day store Pickup on many items and Online Grocery Pickup at more than 600 locations across the country. The company intends to expand this service in the coming year.Wal-Mart is also expanding in e-commerce business through acquisitions. Earlier in Feb 2017, Wal-Mart increased its stake in Chinese eCommerce website, JD.com Inc., to 12.1%, up from the 10.8% stake it had in Oct 2016, and its 5.9% stake in Jun 2016.After the acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart is also aiming to acquire a stake in India's largest eCommerce firm, Flipkart Online Services Pvt., in order to expand in the fast-growing online retail market. Recently on Dec 30, Jet.com acquired Boston-based footwear-shopping website ShoeBuy, which will give Jet.com access to expand in the footwear industry.Moreover, the Bentonville, AR-based company is paying higher wages to its workers and training them to improve its stores performance. However, these initiatives have increased expenses for the company. This, along with unfavorable currency, will take a toll on earnings.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fred's Inc.FREDhas an Earnings ESP of +15.79% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Groupon's Stock Soars As Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates On Solid North America Performance;2/16/2017;"Groupon's (GRPN) stock rose over 20% on Thursday, after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings, with both revenue and adjusted profits beating market expectations. The company also revealed inits annual reportthat it had paid nothing for the acquisition of its competitor LivingSocial last quarter, a company which was once valued at $6 billion.In terms of financial results, Groupon reported 2% year-over-year (y-o-y) growth in revenue to $935 million, against market estimates of about $913 million, driven by solid growth in North America. Its adjusted earnings were 7 cents per share against consensus estimates of 2 cents per share. In terms of geographies, the company's gross billings, revenues and profits declined in international markets, owing to its strategy to focus on the North American market and move away from certain low-margin goods businesses.Groupon has already shut operations in 23 countries in the last 24 months, bringing down its international presence from 47 countries in January 2015 to 24 countries by the end of December 2016. By the end of the second quarter this year, Groupon aims to bring this down to 15 countries primarily in North America and Europe to further streamline its operations.makeArticleAd();North America ResultsNorth America, which has been the primary area of focus for the company, reported revenues of about $651 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.5% on a y-o-y basis. Gross billings for the region improved by 6% over the prior year quarter to over $1.1 billion while operating margin improved dramatically from (-0.4)% in Q4 2015 to 5.3% in Q4 2016. The renewed focus on North America led to an addition of 2 million unique customers during the quarter, including 1 million customers added from LivingSocial.Outlook for 2017Groupon provided its 2017 full year guidance in the recent earnings call in light of the acquisition of LivingSocial, exit from several more international markets, and cost benefits associated with the company's streamlining initiatives. Groupon expects gross profit of $1.3-1.35 billion in 2017 compared to $1.36 billion in full year 2016. It also expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $20o million and $240 million, against $178 million in full year 2016.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"
Fidelity Investments' Revenue And Profit Rose In 2016;2/16/2017;"Known for managing millions of retirement accounts, college   savings plans and regular taxable-investment accounts, Fidelity   Investments on Thursday said 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9   billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses   produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of   19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.""All businesses contributed to our strong results,"" a Fidelity   spokesman said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');The 2016 profit increase reversed a profit decline in   2015, when profit fell $325 million, or 9.8%, from 2014's $3.282   billion.""Fidelity is profitable, strong, innovative and driven to   growth,"" said Jim Lowell, editor-in-chief of Fidelity   Investor, an independent newsletter. ""That's not true for many   financial services companies.""The 2015 profit erosion was caused by spending on staffing and   technology to compete with tough rivals.Operating expenses fell slightly to $12.35 billion in 2016   from $12.4 billion the year before.""The slowdown in expenses is because Fidelity is starting to   see the benefit in Abigail's (Johnson) leadership,"" Lowell said.   One way she has cut spending is by centralizing functions,   eliminating redundancies in information technology and   compliance. ""There's more efficiency,"" Lowell said.Across all of its stock mutual funds, technology was   Fidelity's largest sector as of Jan. 31 with a 20.3%, according   to Morningstar Inc.Fidelity's top U.S. holdings wereApple(AAPL),Facebook(FB),Amazon(AMZN),Alphabet(GOOGL) andMicrosoft(MSFT).Apple's stock has surged 22% since shortly after the election.   It has a so-so 76 Composite Rating from IBD. Facebook has a 90   Comp Rating and is trading near its all-time high after breaking   out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. Amazon has risen   12% this year, has a 76 Comp Rating, and has formed a   cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 843.94. Alphabet's Comp   Rating is 69. Microsoft has a weak 60 Comp Rating. It has   uptrended since June.99 is the highest possible Comp Rating, which is on a scale   from 1-99.Fidelity also reported a record $5.7 trillion in investor   assets under administration (AUA), up 10.6% from year-end   2015.Total discretionary and nondiscretionary asset flow for the   year was $218.9 billion, up 15% from 2015 flow.Discretionary flow includes flow to and from managed accounts,   mutual funds, exchange traded funds and collective investment   trusts.Nondiscretionary flow goes to and from investments not managed   by Fidelity, such as other firms' mutual funds and individual   securities.At year-end, Fidelity serviced 27.5 million members of   workplace retirement plans. It serviced another 8.9 million   retail households, plus 8.7 million institutional accounts.Those totals were 6%, 6.8% and 4.1% higher, respectively, than   at year-end 2015.Fidelity mutual fund managers found it harder to beat their   peers in 2016. Fidelity mutual funds beat 58%, 68% and 70% of   their peers for the trailing one-, three- and five-year periods   that ended Dec. 31. They outperformed 72% of their peers in   the one- and three-year periods and 71% of their peers in   the five-year span.Still, the outperformance rate was high. ""To beat 58% of your   peers and have that as a bad year - most fund companies   would kill for that number,"" said newsletter editor   Lowell. ""The falloff reflects the difficult time active   managers had during the six-week Trump (inspired) market run-up.   Odds are they'll be back to outperforming 70% or more in 2017.   That is excellent.""The annual report is a must-read mainly for Fidelity   employees, who control 51% of the voting stock, while the Johnson   family controls the other 49%.Abigail Johnson is chairwoman of parent company   FMR. She succeeded her father, ""Ned"" Edward C. Johnson III, late   last year, shortly before her 55th birthday. Ned Johnson had been   chairman since 1977.Fidelity was founded by Abigail's grandfather, Edward C.   Johnson II, in 1946. His father, Samuel Johnson, worked in the   family dry goods business at the C.F. Hovey department store.Abigail's brother, 52-year-old Edward C. Johnson IV, is   president of Fidelity's Pembroke Real Estate division.Going forward, a key challenge for Fidelity is persuading   customers - especially mutual fund investors - of the   value of active management. ""Broad indices are holding fair or   fully valued stocks (after the long market run-up),"" Lowell said.   ""Active managers can look at which stocks have the best cash   flow, best defensive characteristics, best growth opportunities,   rather than buying bundles of high-priced stocks passively.""Behind The 2016 ImprovementFormally, the annual report is for Fidelity Financial   Services, which consists of Fidelity Investments and the other   financial services lines of parent company FMR. It excludes FMR's   nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate   operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money   from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from   mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in   net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity   with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset   count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market   funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin   Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin   Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds - mainly exchange   traded funds - reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net   outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus   ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That   made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net   inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor   Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent   report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to   a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly   outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997   billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow - there were 314   if them - had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its   ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2   billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds   and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5   billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock   mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4   billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3   billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI   U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion.   And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality   Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.Money Market FundsIn addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive   net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data   for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8   billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund   (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash   Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflowwas driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President   Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar,   expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve   and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research   services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out   from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange   Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose   redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in   time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt.   Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group   are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In   turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want   their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to   penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells     Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In     2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual     Fund Net Inflow"
Amazon.com Is Giving Us a Closer Glimpse of Its Prime Subscriber Numbers;2/16/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) doesn't like to give Wall Street more information   than it has to. It took a long time for the company to show   investors the financials of Amazon Web Services, its cloud   computing platform, and it was already a $4.6 billion business by   the time Amazon did. But Amazon's reporting a new revenue   category for its retail operations that gives us a small glimpse   into how big Amazon Prime is.In its latest 10-K filing, Amazon reported a line item called   ""retail subscription services."" The segment includes ""annual and   monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime membership, as well as   audiobook, e-book, digital video, digital music, and other   subscription services,"" according to the SEC filing. Those   services brought in $6.4 billion in revenue last year.The number could give us a hint as to how many Prime members   Amazon has.makeArticleAd();Image source: Amazon.com.The minimum number of Prime membersOver the past few years, management has given us some hints as   to how many Prime members Amazon has. Here's what management   said, and what it implies for Amazon's membership numbers.YearWhat Management SaidMinimum Number of Prime Members Implied2013""We now have tens of millions of members             worldwide.""20 million2014""Worldwide paid membership grew 53% last year.""30.6 million2015""Worldwide paid Prime memberships increased 51%""46.2 million2016""Tens of millions of new paid members joined the             program in just this past year.""66.2 millionHow do those numbers compare with subscription revenue?What's interesting about these implied numbers is that   subscription revenue grew at the same rate as Prime members last   year -- 43%. Subscription revenue grew 62% in 2015, faster than   the 51% growth in Prime membership. So while Prime is definitely   the biggest factor, it's not the only thing contributing   revenue.Audible, with its ""millions of subscribers"" paying at least   $14.95 per month, is a sizable factor as well, at least 5%. Add   in a few Kindle Unlimited subscribers and some Amazon Music   subscribers, and it's possible Prime accounts for as much as 90%   of Amazon's subscription revenue, asMorgan Stanley's Brian Nowack estimates.That implies the average global Prime member pays at most   $86.93 per year, if we presume Amazon has at least 66.2 million   of them.That number seems a bit high, considering two-thirds of   Amazon's sales come from outside the U.S., where Prime is usually   less expensive. For example, over 10% of total sales came from   Germany last year, where Amazon charged just 49 euros ($52) per   year for Prime last year. Japan accounts for about 8% of sales,   and Prime costs just 3,900 yen ($34) per year. Prime in Canada is   just 79 Canadian dollars ($60.50).Considering the impact of lower-priced Prime subscriptions   around the world and regular promotions in the U.S., it's likely   the average Prime member pays closer to $80 per month. At that   rate, there are as many as 72 million total Prime members around   the world. A more conservative estimate might be the midpoint --   69 million.But the number could be even higherAmazon doesn't count all the cash it receives from Prime   members as revenue when they sign up for the service. Instead, it   amortizes the yearly fee over the 12-month membership length.   Each month it transfers a certain amount fromunearned revenueto its revenue.As such, estimates using revenue from all of 2016 can only   provide an average number of Prime members for the full year. And   since the number is going up, Amazon's current Prime membership   numbers are certainly higher than its average membership numbers   from last year.Considering the holiday season is prime time to sign up for   Prime (pun intended), sign-ups are likely backloaded in Amazon's   fiscal year. The result is Amazon has significantly more Prime   members than what its numbers can tell us. While Amazon gave us a   glimpse at how much revenue its Prime members are producing, it's   still obfuscating the actual number of members itself.Regardless, it's a very big number, and it's still growing   rapidly. That's as much as Amazon investors can ask for, and it   should make them very happy.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Go Long Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock for Free;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast August I wrote about how to get paid fromWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM). The trade on WFM stock was a success, and I created income out of thin air.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Today, I want to reload for another run of income from Whole Foods.Although Main Street's opinion of Whole Foods is high, Wall Street lost its love for WFM. But this has created an opportunity to sell downside risk against the extreme pessimism that currently plagues the stock.The predominant stance of analysts is a ""hold,"" so the threat of downgrades has abated. This usually means that the count of incremental sellers is low. Furthermore, bears have failed since last September to break the recent flat channel, so maybe this is as bad as it gets for now.Don't confuse my commitment to go long WFM stock here as a statement of optimism. It's not. This is me betting that the worst case for the stock is mostly priced in here.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn't Done Correcting YetI don't want to worry about the intermediate-term on this one. So I will go out in time and use leaps to accomplish my goal. This trade can be done using the August expiration.How to Trade WFM Stock Right NowThe Trade - Bullish WFM:Sell the Jan 2018 $20 put for 50 cents per contract to open. By selling naked puts, I've committed to buying the stock at my sold strike should price fall below it. I only do this if I am willing and able to own it at that price. My breakeven point is $19.50 per share.I chose $20 because it would put me long WFM stock at a level that allows for another level reset lower should traders decide to further punish the stock. The 34% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success.I can alter this trade into a credit put spread to better fit a small account.The Alternate - Bullish WFM:Sell the Jan 2018 $23/$20 credit put spread for 42 cents per contract to open. This has a smaller price buffer but still yields 16% on money risked if successful. The benefit of this trade is that it carries a smaller worst case scenario.I won't hedge my bet yet by selling credit call spreads on WFM stock yet. I am confident that I would be able to manage the price action in the short-term for this long-term trade.I am not required to hold these trades into expiration.

Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRoughly half of American homes no longer have an old-school telephone, relying instead on cell phones and smartphones. IfAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA report inTheWall Street Journalsuggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.The Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New TelephoneTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers:replacing the home telephone.The idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services likeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found thatnearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline.But, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.Apparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Amazon's Echo is home to Alexa, withover 5,000 skills. These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.The Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.So, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephoneandsave consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.The Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a TelephoneWhile the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.TheWall Street Journalarticle lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.Amazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.It's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, theFCC lists a series of limitations to 911 servicewhen home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.Calls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteDespite the challenges,The Wall Street Journalsays its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability ""the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers."" And, that move could happen later this year.The question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe postWould You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc.

BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) Stock Is the Best Investment of the Century;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince going public in 1999, the asset management firm known asBlackRock Inc.(NYSE:BLK) has been the best investment of the 21st century.makeArticleAd();Yes, it's better thanAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), a lot better. It's up 2,670% in that time, and it has been paying dividends in a rising stream since 2003. Payouts started at 20 cents per share and now bring in $2.50 each quarter. An income investor who got in on the 1999 IPO, paying $14 per share, is now collecting $10 per share in dividends each year.Some of the capital gains are a trick of the light. BlackRock did not participate in the ""dot-bomb,"" the collapse of Internet stocks that began in early 2000 afterTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) gave AOL 60% of its equity in a merger. BlackRock doubled in value that year.If you start calculating after the dot-bomb wreckage cleared, BlackRock is up ""only"" 1,000%, against a nearly 5,400% gain for Amazon during that time.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also outpaced it since going public in 2004.The point is that with few exceptions, like the 2008 stock market collapse, the value of BLK stock has consistently increased. And, even during that crisis - where its market cap was cut in half and other companies collapsed completely - BlackRock did not cut that dividend.America's Best Banker?CEO and co-founder Larry Fink is not often mentioned in the same breath as bankers like Jamie Dimon ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein ofGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS); he just does better for his investors.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveBlackRock wasfounded in 1988with operating capital from Pete Peterson of the Blackstone Group, from which it separated in 1995 after a dispute withStephen Schwarzmann, orchestrated withPNC Financial Services Group Inc(NYSE:PNC), whose investment arm came into BlackRock in 1998. BLK went public a year later at $14 per share.Since then, Fink has gone from strength to strength. BlackRock was hired to clean up the mess of the 2008 meltdown. BlackRock Solutions unwound the toxic mortgage assets. Plus, the same year it was hired for that job (2009), BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors and its iShares franchise.BlackRock's tech assets include Aladdin, an investment system from BlackRock Solutions, andiRetire, a retirement investment framework offered by other financial advisors.Hedge in the Age of TrumpAs BlackRock has grown, it has developed a knack for taking deals others wouldn't even consider - and making them work.Right now, for instance, BlackRock is spending $500 million renovating the Willis (nee Sears) Tower in Chicago. In 2015, BLK bought the 108-story landmark, the world's tallest building when completed in 1973, for $1.3 billion.For BlackRock, that's a small deal, actually. It's currently buying First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-producing energy projects like mid-stream pipelines, grabbing for Trump's infrastructure moneywith both hands.Fink is skeptical of the Trump rally, and of the President's plans for the dollar. Fink still loves the Mexican peso and is worried about the future of the global economy in the age of Trump. But, BlackRock keeps politics and business separate, its response to the travel ban mainly a letter to employees.BlackRock's ETF business hasmore than $1 trillion in assets.It considers Russia a buy, but is skeptical of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne joins BLK as an adviser.Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!During the fourth quarter of 2016, BlackRock againbeat analyst estimates, earning $852 million, $5.14 per share, on revenue of $2.89 billion. It brought approximately one-third of revenue to the net income line because most of its money came in the form of investment advisory fees, from administration fees and securities lending.Bottom Line for BlackRock StockWhen BlackRock plunges into a stock, it can hold up, despite real business pressures. An example isGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) - without BlackRock's investment, the company might be worthless now. Similarly, BLK's growing investment inFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC), the transaction processing company,also made headlines.BlackRock operates passively, and its growth - considering the sheer size of its investment portfolio -concerns some reporters and regulators.Don't let yourself be counted among them. This is one of those stocks which, likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), you can buy, put away and generally ignore, while still remaining confident of solid returns. BLK stock has a 20-year track record of stellar performance, and the founders remain at their desks.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Amazon Plans to Drop Packages With Parachutes From Drones;2/16/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has long teased consumers with the idea that it   would someday deliver packages via drones.The company has pursued the idea even though it's not   currently legal to use unmanned flying vehicles for most   commercial activities (including package delivery) in the United   States. And while that could eventually change, the Federal   Aviation Administration (FAA) has so far been wary of the   retailer's vision that someday the sky could be filled with   package-bearing drones.Those significant implementation hurdles however have not   stopped the online retailer from advancing the development of   what it calls Prime Air. The goal of that effort, according to   the company, is ""to safely get packages to customers in 30   minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called   drones,"" according to Amazon'sweb pagefor the service. The company sees drones as having the potential   to allow it to improve its service and delivery times while also   increasing ""the overall safety and efficiency of the   transportation system.""makeArticleAd();Exactly how the retailer intends to do that has remained a bit   of a mystery. Would drones fly up and knock on your door? Would   they bring packages to windows or drop them from the sky? Now, a   newpatent filingfrom Amazon shows at least one method the company could use --   dropping packages on parachutes from drones.Amazon plans to use drones like this one to deliver     packages. Image source: Amazon.What is Amazon doing?In its patent filing the online leader explains that it plans   a package delivery system that would launch a package from a   drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) while it's in motion. The   drone would be able to control the descent of the package in a   number of ways which the company laid out in its filing.The package delivery system can apply the force onto the     package in a number of different ways. For example, pneumatic     actuators, electromagnets, spring coils, and parachutes can     generate the force that establishes the vertical descent path     of the package. Further, the package delivery system can also     monitor the package during its vertical descent.Essentially a parachute and/or other control mechanisms would   help guide the package to Earth. It/they would also be able to   steer the package around obstructions or help it regain stability   if something disrupted its flight.Why does Amazon want this?The online retailer has built warehouses all around the U.S.   and setup shipping operations which allow it to offer two-day   delivery across the country. In some markets it has improved on   that with same-day delivery, but using trucks, people, and even   couriers to make deliveries is expensive. Using drones would, at   least with some deliveries in some markets, make getting packages   to consumers cheaper and more efficient.Amazon explained in its patent filing that the use of UAVs can   overcome some of the inefficiencies of traditional delivery   methods ""by leveraging more flexible aerial transportation paths   between destinations, rather than relying on rigid road   infrastructure."" In theory drones can travel more direct routes   and deliver more packages than traditional methods. The online   retailer does acknowledge that drones come with their own   problems because at some point they have to drop off the   package.""Traditionally, this involves the UAV landing at the   destination, releasing the package, and then taking off to its   next destination,"" wrote the company.  ""The sequence of   landing and taking off for each package delivery creates time and   energy resource inefficiencies, which negate at least a portion   of the benefit of adopting a network system of UAVs.""Using parachutes solves that problem. It's likely that a   parachute-based solution would only work with certain products,   in select areas (it's hard to picture parachutes falling in   Manhattan) and this patent is only one possible way Amazon would   use drones for deliveries.Is this going to happen?It's easy to see the business reasons Amazon wants to use   drones. If it can offer near-immediate delivery in broad coverage   areas the online retailer takes away the last advantage   brick-and-mortar stores have. The challenge in doing that remains   solving the problem of the last mile -- getting items from a   nearby warehouse to the consumer.Drones may be part of that solution, but it still may be a   long time before broad use of UAVs becomes legal or even   practical. There's a point where using UAVs with parachutes may   make sense, but the process would have to be efficient enough to   make financial sense for Amazon. That's something the company   needs to work on and it's a challenge that's equally as daunting   as the significant legal hurdles that currently keep drone   delivery from being a reality.Someday drone delivery will be a real thing, at least in   certain situations. That day however remains in the distant   future. These plans are clever, and it makes sense for Amazon to   take a long view to developing its business, but drones will have   no impact on the company's sales for the foreseeable future.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Groupon (GRPN) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates;2/16/2017;"Shares ofGroupon Inc.GRPNwere up 22.75% on Feb 15 following  impressive fourth-quarter 2016 results. The company reported earnings of 3 cents per share as against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents.However, we note that, shares of Groupon have underperformed the broader ZacksInternet Commerceindustry over the last one year. While the industry registered growth of 46.3%, the stock gained only 21.9%.The underperformance of the stock could be primarily due to an intensifying competitive landscape that has increased pricing pressure for the company.RevenuesRevenues of $935 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million and also inched up 1.9% on a year-over-year basis. Direct revenues (63.5% of total revenue) increased 3.8% while Third Party & other (36.5% of total revenue) declined 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 4.5% from the year-ago quarter while that from EMEA and the Rest of World (Asia-Pacific and Latin America) declined 2% and 11.7% year over year, respectively.On a constant currency basis, Rest of World (Asia-Pacific and Latin America) revenues declined 8% on a year-over-year basis, while EMEA increased 1%.Gross billings dipped 0.4% year over year to $1.67 billion in the quarter. Region-wise, billings from North America jumped 5.9% year over year. However, billings from EMEA and the Rest of World declined 8.9% and 15.4% year over year, respectively.On a same-country basis, gross billings grew 2% year over year excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.North America local gross billings of $1.1 billion grew 5.9% and North America local revenues of $650.8 million grew 4.5% in the reported quarter primarily attributable to new customer additions as well as the acquisition of LivingSocial.During the quarter, Groupon reduced its country presence to 24 from 47. The company plans to finally operate in 15 countries in Europe and North America.As of Dec 31, 2016, Groupon had approximately 31.1 million active customers in North America. The company added nearly 5.2 million new customers in the quarter. Active customers were 52.7 million.Operating DetailsGross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 39.6% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributed to lower Third Party & other gross margin, which fell 120 bps, partially offset by 380 bps increase in Direct gross margin.North America gross profit increased 14%, EMEA declined 25% and Rest of World slumped 10%. Local gross margins stood at 31.4% as compared to 30.1% in the year ago quarter. On the other hand, Goods margins expanded by 140 bps to 11.7% on the back of improved pricing algorithms.Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 130 bps to 8.6% reflecting successful implementations of the company's streamlining initiatives.Groupon's operating expenses dropped 6.3% year over year to $347.8 million due to lower selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A), which was down 11.6%, reflecting the benefits of streamlined operations and lower headcount.Marketing expenses increased 12.2% from the year-ago quarter due to investments on customer acquisition both online and off-line.Nevertheless, Groupon reported operating loss of $362.4 million as compared with a loss of $377.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Dec 31, 2016, Groupon had cash and cash equivalents worth $891.8 million as compared with $853.3 million as on Sep 30, 2016.Free cash flow was $268.9 million up a 14.5% when compared to the year ago quarter.During the fourth quarter, Groupon repurchased 12,397,795  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $49.9 million.OutlookFor first-quarter 2017, Groupon intends to bring its country count to 15 with respect to its strategy of streamlining its business.Seasonally, the first quarter is the lightest. Groupon expects to report lowest billings and adjusted EBITDA. However, management expects adjusted EBITDA to be slightly better that the year-ago quarter.For full-year 2017, Groupon projects gross profit to remain in a range of $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion (for the 15 countries), a jump of $40 million to $90 million from full year 2016 on an FX neutral basis.Also, adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain in a range of $200 million to $240 million (for the 15 countries), a jump of $16 million to $56 million compared with full year 2016 on an FX neutral basis.Our TakeGroupon's new business strategy (with core focus on marketing, international and shopping) appears to be working. Its performance has started to improve since the past few quarters after CEO Rich Williams took the helm.The company continues to see strength in its customer acquisition and shopping endeavors, aimed at developing its local core business. Notably, its North American business returned to growth during 2016 after hitting a patch of stagnation.Further, the company has been taking a number of strategic initiatives to streamline its operations. Additionally, it has increased its marketing spend, which should boost its business to a great extent in the long run.Although softness in the business was observed during the run up to the elections and a few weeks after it, the company is again back on a strong footing. This indicates growing demand for the company's platforms, which augurs well in the long run.However, Groupon is investing quite a bit in the transition, which is expected to affect its near-term financials. Competition from giants like eBayEBAYand Amazon.comAMZNand impending lawsuits are the other headwinds investors need to watch out for.Groupon, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGroupon, Inc.

Sales were up 22% year-over-year and net income   popped 55%.The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is almost always one   of its bright spots -- it brought in $3.53 billion in Q4 2016 --   and it's also turning into one Amazon's biggest IoT assets.Part of AWS' future growth potential comes from its AWS IoT   service, which allows developers to manage their data and track   analytics from connected devices. Amazon's robust cloud-based   server system is quickly becoming a staple for many companies,   and as those same companies further embed themselves into   Amazon's AWS system it'll be a logical step for them to use AWS   IoT for their connected devices.If all that weren't enough, Amazon is leading in the   home-automation space as well with its Echo devices and Alexa   virtual assistant. Amazon has opened up Alexa to third party   developers and other companies so that they can implement the   assistant into their products, further tying companies and   consumers into its ecosystem.NVIDIA's burning IoT opportunityNVIDIA's stock has been on a tear since the beginning of 2016,   and is up 300% over the past year. The company's leading position   in the GPU chip market has morphed into astrong lead in self-driving technologies.The company's Drive PX 2 supercomputer is helping dozens of   automakers and automotive parts suppliers create driverless car   technologies by using GPUs to quickly process and identify images   captured by self-driving vehicles.The company also has big plans to use its new DGX-1   supercomputer to help offload some of a self-driving car's   on-board processing to the cloud, which would allow driverless   cars to process even more information faster than they do   now.NVIDIA has managed to grow revenue to a record high of $6.91   billion in fiscal 2017, up 38% from a year ago. Additionally, net   income skyrocketed by 171% and diluted earnings per share were up   138% year over year.With the stock's spike in 2016, some investors may be worried   that the company has no more room to grow, but keep in mind that   NVIDIA has only just begun to tap into the $42 billion (by 2025)   driverless car market, and only brought in $127 million in   automotive revenue in fiscal Q4 2017.An IoT tinderboxSkyworks is in the middle of shifting its mobile   prospects to the Internet of Things, and its stock is up   about 50% over the past 12 months.Skyworks earns the majority of its revenue -- about 40% -- by   providing chips forApple's devices, but that should't be a deterrent for investors   looking for solid IoT investment.The company's current mobile business is shifting to IoT   connections, primarily through connected cars. Skyworks'   management said on its fiscal first-quarter 2017 earnings call   that the ""connected car is yet another catalyst that offers   significant opportunity"" for the company. Many of the company's   car connectivity chips are used for collision avoidance right   now, and Skyworks anticipates demand for its chips to increase as   semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles hit the market.Skyworks' CEO, Liam Griffin, said on the earnings call, ""By   2020 a single autonomous car is expected to consume 4,000   gigabits of data per day in realtime diagnostics, positioning,   vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and that's equivalent to the   daily data consumed by more than 2,000 smartphone users in   2017.""The massive opportunity of connecting cars to the Internet   should give Skyworks any easy transition from mobile to the IoT.   And the company is already in a good position for more growth.   Revenues were up more than 9% year over year in the current   quarter, and the company forecasts 10% sales growth for the rest   of the fiscal year.There will be a estimated 250 million connected cars on   the road by 2020, and the overall autonomous driving market will   be worth $77 billion by 2035. With its chips, Skyworks is   perfectly positioned to benefit from the expanding market.We're still at the beginning stages of the Internet of Things,   but these companies are already building out their own   niches in the space. As the market expands, NVIDIA, Amazon, and   Skyworks should all make the short list for investors considering   adding IoT positions to their portfolios.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Walmart Splurges $51 Million on Outdoor Retailer Moosejaw;2/15/2017;"On Wednesday, retail giantWalmartWMTannouncedits acquisition of Moosejaw, a popular and fast-growing outdoor retailer, for $51 million. The all-cash deal closed on February 13.Moosejaw is headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, and is a fairly small retailer, with only 10 physical stores across the Midwest. Its online presence, however, is huge, and a popular choice for people who lead an active outdoor lifestyle. Moosejaw carries over 400 brands, including Patagonia, The North Face, Canada Goose, Marmot, Arc'teryx, and more.Walmart wants to continue to operate the Moosejaw website and stores as a standalone business, as well as a complementary one. With Walmart's firepower and commitment to online growth, Moosejaw.com will definitely benefit.Moosejaw's success comes at a time when other outdoor and athletic retailers have struggled. Eastern Mountain Sports filed for bankruptcy just last week, while Gander Mountain, a stalwart in hunting, fishing, and camping, is reportedly near a bankruptcy filing. Sports Authority was liquidated last year after no interested buyer came forward, and Cabela'sCABis in the process of being acquired by Bass Pro Shops.This is an obvious ""in-your-face"" move directed at Walmart's biggest rival, AmazonAMZN, especially as the e-commerce giant's presence in retail continues to escalate. It also comes on the heels of other acquisitions. Walmart recently scooped up online footwear store Shoebuy, andnotably bought Jet.comfor $3 billion last year.""Apparel and accessories is now the number one category for digital commerce, according to comScore, and we gain the experience of another well-established e-commerce player, this time in the active outdoor category,"" Walmart said in astatement.The acquisition gives Walmart access to Moosejaw's industry relationships with top apparel brands like Patagonia and The North Face, and it allows the company to carry select items from these brands through its other storefronts like Walmart.com, Jet.com, and ShoeBuy, if it wanted to.Currently, WMT is a #4 (Sell) on the Zacks Rank.

Attunity Ltd. - Big Data Enabler With 84% Upside;2/15/2017;"ByCobiaman:Share Price - $8.00Market Cap - $140 millionEnterprise Value - $131 million2016 Revenue - $54.5 million2017E Revenue - $66.9 million (23% growth)2018E Revenue - $82.5 million (23% growth)EV/2016 Revenue - 2.4xEV/2017E Revenue - 1.9xEV/2018E Revenue - 1.6xAttunity Ltd. (ATTU) provides software to enterprises used to replicate and integrate heterogeneous data sources into a single data lake, which provides the basis for creating data warehouses used for Big Data analysis. The company has been in existence for 20 years, first providing software used to integrate mainframe data and then adding more data sources as they became available in the market. Current data sources include Oracle (Oracle), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Amazon Redshift (AMZN), Teradata (TDC), Hadoop, and modern streaming data sources. The company has OEM relationships with Microsoft and Amazon where the companies embed Attunity's solution into their own when data replication is called for.Attunity's revenue grew quickly in the 2014-2015 time frame, with 43% growth in 2014 and 36% growth in 2015. This growth was driven by the need to gather data from various corporate sources and assemble it into data warehouses for analysis. Attunity has a simple but powerful solution that enables a much faster time to analysis for its customers. Attunity is admittedly a smaller player in the market facing bigger competition in Informatica (INFA) and IBM (IBM), but its solution is robust and has proven successful for its customer base. In 2014 and 2015, Attunity mostly sold into smaller opportunities of $1 million or less with six to nine month sales cycles. By 2016, Attunity's success and increasing name recognition began to attract larger deals with longer sales cycles and different sales team requirements. The company found that some of its sales force was not up to the task and revenue only grew 11% as some large deals slipped during the year.makeArticleAd();Attunity management acknowledged the problem and swapped out 15 of its weaker sales hands and replaced them with more experienced enterprise software sales people. Our work suggests that the company's problem in 2016 was indeed company-specific as the market for its type of software remained robust. Management is convinced that the worst of its sales issues are behind it and this was borne out by a beat and raise December quarter. The company notched sales of $15.6 million versus expectations of $14.3 million. Guidance for 2017 was set at $62-65 million, above consensus of $60 million.We believe that after the company's tough 2016, management is guiding more conservatively for 2017 than it did last year. The market seems to be supportive of growth rates seen in 2014 and 2015, yet neither the management team nor the analysts want to get ahead of themselves at this point. Given the very high gross margins in this business (90%), there is a ton of operating leverage once revenue gets moving. Management guided to 5-8% operating margins in 2017 but these could go much higher, especially in 2018, if revenue ramps ahead of plan.We value ATTU on an enterprise value to revenue basis based on 2018 numbers. Based on our current 2018 revenue forecast, ATTU trades at 1.6x revenue. We believe it should trade at a substantially higher multiple of 3x. The closest public comp, Talend SA (TLND) trades at 4x 2018 numbers and operates in essentially the same market. At 3x, ATTU would be worth $14.72, or 84% higher than its current trading price.In terms of an endgame, Attunity could grow organically for an extended period in this large market, but it could also present an interesting acquisition target for a larger strategic or financial player. The CEO, Shimon Alon, is the largest shareholder with 8% of the stock, so he has a considerable financial interest in the company's future. Interestingly Microsoft, as an OEM partner, has right of first refusal for any acquisition proposed by another party. This demonstrates the importance of ATTU to Microsoft and presumably to its other OEM partner.Attunity is a bit of a relic in its perpetual license revenue model. While most software companies today are in the Software-as-a-Service ((SAAS)) model, Attunity's customer base demands ownership of its software products, so it sells to them in a perpetual fashion. This business model is a two-edged sword as revenue above/below forecast drops to the bottom line and causes large EPS beats/misses. The main risk for Attunity is that some deals slip out of a quarter causing a revenue and earnings shortfall.See alsoBuffett Fleeing Wal-Mart: Beginning Of The End For The Giant Retailer?on seekingalpha.com"
Amazon.com Shares Could Be Headed to $1,000;2/15/2017;"Despite its gargantuan size, shares ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) have gained an incredible 66% over the past year   alone, largely thanks to strong performance within the company's   Amazon Web Services (AWS) division combined with continued growth   in Prime members.Investorsstill don't have a specific figurefor Prime members, but it's clear that Prime members are soaring   after Amazon added ""tens of millions"" of new paid members in   2016. Most third-party estimates peg total Prime members   somewhere in the range of 65 million to 75 million. Meanwhile,   the AWS business is so profitable that it effectively subsidizes   Amazon's international e-commerce business, which still operates   at a loss as Amazon continues to invest in it.In fact, AWS is such a strong business that it could help   propel shares close to the $1,000 threshold.makeArticleAd();Word on the StreetOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein is out with a research   note today (viaTech Trader Daily) reiterating an outperform rating while boosting his price   target from $900 to $970, which would flirt with the four-digit   threshold. After perusing Amazon's 10-K for some light reading,   Helfstein came away impressed with how capital-efficient AWS is   becoming.Image source: Getty Images.The analyst is reducing his expectations for capital   expenditures in 2017 by $1 billion, and expects capital spending   to come in at $6 billion this year. Even after factoring in   estimates for price cuts, which is common throughout the cloud   infrastructure market over time, Helfstein is modeling for $0.82   of incremental revenue per $1 of capital expenditures. Looking   farther out, this ratio should trend toward $0.70 per $1 of   capital expenditures, which would translate into about $11.1   billion in unlevered free cash flow in 2020.Capital spending should accelerate in 2018, but by then   higher-value services combined with continued hardware   efficiencies should take the driver's seat in terms of returns.   Helfstein has meaningfully increased his overall estimate for the   value of AWS, moving it from $212 billion to $258 billion. That   revised estimate is nearly two-thirds of Amazon's current market   cap of $400 billion.Thanks, AWSFor context, here's Amazon's cash capital expenditures over   the past three years.YearCash Capital Expenditures2014$4.9 billion2015$4.6 billion2016$6.7 billionData source: Amazon 10-K.Amazon does not provide guidance for 2017 capital   expenditures, but in general the bulk of its spending relates to   ongoing expansion of fulfillment infrastructure as well as AWS   infrastructure.

Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks;2/15/2017;"When I first started investing, I judged dividend-paying   stocks solely on their yield. In my mind, the higher the yield,   the better.Thankfully, I quickly learned that investing in income stocks   based on their yield alone is a huge mistake. In fact, a   super-high yield can often be a sign ofdanger. That's why I've been refining my process for dividend stock   selection for years, and I now focus on several other factors   before making a buy or sell decision.So what are those factors? Below, you'll find the checklist I   use to put a dividend-paying stock to the test.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Test No. 1: Predictable revenueI'm convinced that the bestdividend   stockshave control over their top line. After all, companies that   depend on factors outside of their control for revenue can see   their profits evaporate when the markets take a downturn.A shining example of a company with predictable revenue isBroadridge Financial Solutions(NYSE: BR) . Broadridge helps other companies with record   keeping and investor communications by handling boring but   mission-critical financial paperwork such as proxy   statements and prospectuses. The business was spun offADPin 2007 and it truly dominates its industry, boasting a   market share of roughly 80%. Since companies need to remain in   contact with their investors through all market conditions,   Broadridge's financial statements arehighlypredictable.By contrast, consider the office supply retailerStaples(NASDAQ: SPLS) . With a massive yield of 5.2% (more than twice   the S&P 500's average dividend yield of 2.2%!), the old me   would have been foaming at the mouth to buy the stock. However,   Staples' revenue has been declining for years due to the   significant pressure from e-commerce companies such asAmazon.com.Have a look at what has happened to these two companies   top-lines over the past five years.BR Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsWhile Staples' managementhas a planto help reverse the trend, I don't have any confidence in   this company's ability to generate predictable top-line results   from here, so I would urge investors to look elsewhere for   opportunity.Test No. 2: A sustainable payout ratioThe next must-know metric for any dividend stock is itspayout ratio. This figure is calculated by dividing the company's dividend   payment per share by its earnings per share. For example, if   a company's annual dividend payment is $1 per share and its   earnings are $4 per share, then its payout ratio is 25%   ($1/$4).In general, a low payout ratio suggests that a dividend   is sustainable since it provides the company with financial   flexibility in case something bad happens. Thus, any stock with a   very high payout ratio -- say, above 80% -- should be approached   with caution, even if it passes the first test.For that reason, I've taken a pass on the cigarette and real   estate companyVector Group(NYSE: VGR) . That might come as a surprise since this company's   top line is highly predictable and has been growing for years.   With a dividend yield of 7.1%, what's not to like?VGR Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.That's all great, but Vector Group has sported a payout ratio   above 100% for several years, meaning that its dividend payment   exceeds its net income. The company has pulled off this trick by   turning to the debt markets to fund the difference. While this   strategy has worked for some time, its current payout   ratio of 262% is a big cause for concern.By contrast, Broadridge offers up a much smaller dividend   yield of 1.9%. However, Broadridge's payout ratio is only 48% of   trailing earning, which suggests that its dividend is far more   stable than Vector Group's.Test No. 3: Strong growth prospectsThebest dividend   stocksnot only sustain their current payouts but canincreasethem over time, too. That why I exclude companies that pass the   first two tests but are not expected to grow much over the coming   years.ConsiderFirstEnergy(NYSE: FE) . As a utility, its revenue is highly   predictable. In addition, its low payout ratio of 51% suggests   that its dividend yield of 4.6% is quite sustainable.However, FirstEnergy's aging power plants run primarily on   coal, so its expenses have been on the rise as it works to reduce   its carbon emissions. When mixed with slow but steady declines in   revenue, its profits have taken a big hit over the last few   years.FE Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.Worse yet, market watchers believe this trend will continue   for the foreseeable future. Analysts project that the company's   profits will decline by more than 5% annually over the next few   years. While the Trump administration has taken a pro-coal   stance, the long-term outlook for the industry istoo toughto ignore. That leads me to believe that this is a stock to   avoid.Yet again, this is a test that Broadridge Financial passes   with flying colors. The combination of organic growth and   acquisitions should allow the company to grow its top-line by   single digits over the next five years. Better yet, modest margin   improvements and share buybacks are expected to fuel 12% earnings   growth over this time frame.Given all of the above, perhaps it isn't surprising to learn   that I think that Broadridge Financial is a top-notch dividend   stock. With a predictable revenue stream, a sustainable payout   ratio, and solid growth prospects, this company passes my test   with flying colors. That makes Broadridge a strong   dividend stock that any income investor could learn to love.10 stocks we like better than Broadridge Financial   SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Worry About Oracle;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll too much like James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi flickAvatar, just when you think the feud betweenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is over, you find out it's not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it's the latter, it's not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.GOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle's argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot caselike the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.GOOGL: Here We Go AgainWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what's going on, and even then, there's no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here's the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software - which is free, open-source software - in its Android operating system.The suit largely hinges on what constitutes ""fair use"" of open-source and freely-available software.7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TVWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system.The complaint specifically read:""The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle's creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle's expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.""The strength of Oracle's copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularlyemphasizedby the company in the prior jury trial.Alphabet's counterargument is simpler -CEO Larry Page said, ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""If all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there's a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year's loss suffered by Oracle. That case's loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and OthersOwners of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals - a reversal of a prior judgment - are very difficult win.The case, though, will have far-reaching consequences beyond the Alphabet/Oracle tiff. In essence, this contest could largely help affirm just how ""open"" open source code really is even if its user ends up commercializing it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhaps in a bigger sense though, this trial will once again serve as an indictment on decency (or lack thereof) and common sense (or, again, lack thereof).Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017While not a legal matter raised during any of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror's minds were apt to be asking themselves why Oracle would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commercial uses - if it didn't want it to be used this extensively.Another relevant but unasked question is why Java's original developer, Sun Microsystems, supported Android's use of the platform before Oracle acquired Sun, but Oracle switched gears on the stance after buying Sun Microsystems. And, perhaps if Oracle had been more clear about how its rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harmed the market for Java"" when it's not really otherwise monetized, a judge and jury could have been a little more sympathetic.As it stands though, the Oracle argument looks to be founded more on regret and frustration and less on merits. The courts so far seem to be picking up on that.Broadly speaking, it all bodes well for other entities that have somehow commercialized open source software and APIs.* Avatar, while a stunningly successful film, was a three hour epic, and could have easily ended at two points in the film before the third (and actual) ending.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About Oracleappeared first onInvestorPlace."
How Amazon Payments Could Be The Next Big Thing;2/15/2017;"While retail seems like an old-school business, Amazon has integrated it with innovative and advanced technology, creating a company that challenges players across industries. Amazon.com (AMZN) doesn't just dominate the U.S. e-commerce marketplace - it’s among the top cloud computing platforms, and is well known for its cargo planes and drones too.To further expand and strengthen its ecosystem of products and services, Amazonlaunchedits payment gateway – ‘Pay with Amazon’ in October 2013 with an aim to provide an uninterrupted shopping experience to its customers and affiliate online merchants. However, number of customers engaging with ‘Pay with Amazon’ trails behind its e-commerce users.As per a surveyreportby Channel Advisor, when comparing marketplaces, “more than 60% of respondents said Amazon is generating the greatest sales volume for their products.” However, when it comes to payments, about 70% of respondents named PayPal as the most commonly used payment method by customers after only debit/credit cards. 15% go with Amazon Payments.makeArticleAd();While this is reflective of Amazon’s struggle in a highly competitive payments market, it is also indicative of the huge opportunity that lies ahead for Amazon Payments. Here’s why Amazon Payments could become a significant revenue generator for Amazon changing its ‘underappreciated’ status going forward.Growing E-Commerce MarketWhile the e-commerce marketplace is expanding fast, it continues to be a small segment of the total retail market. In the U.S., the retail e-commerce sales for the third quarter of 2016 were just 8.35% of the total retail sales that were estimated at $1.21 trillion as per areportby the U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce. eMarketer estimates that the worldwide retail e-commerce sales will increase to $4.05 trillion in 2020, making up 14.6% of total retail spending that year.The scope to penetrate further into the e-commerce segment provides Amazon with a big opportunity and gives a fair chance for hundreds of merchants to join the online bandwagon. This indirectly opens a vast ground for its affiliate payment service which nearly doubled the payment volume in 2016.Beyond The Top MerchantsAmazon’s payment service enables customers visiting websites of partner companies to pay using their Amazon account (shipment address, card information, etc.). However, due to fear of revealing customer data to Amazon, many e-commerce entities have avoided the adoption of ‘Pay with Amazon’. This trend has benefited PayPal, ApplePay, Google Wallet and other payment providers.Interestingly, there is enough room for Amazon to grow beyond the top e-retailers by roping in second and third-tier online merchants in the U.S. and worldwide who aren’t intimidated by Amazon (with many selling goods through Amazon) and value the trust provided by Amazon payment gateway.Such partnerships need not be limited to e-retailers but any service provider using digital payment (such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, taxi services). By adding the ‘Pay with Amazon’ button, these merchants make spending much simpler for the 300 million plus user base of Amazon on their portals. During 2016, more than 33 million customersusedAmazon Payments to make a purchase.Connected CarsAmazon is making its way into the connected car space by teaming up with automobile companies to integrate its cloud-based voice service Alexa to enable customers to play audiobooks, check weather, control Alexa-enabled smart homes and even shop. Amazon’s current tie-ups include brands such asFord,Hyundai,Volkswagen,BMW,GenesisandINRIX.While this is just the beginning and most of the features are limited to remote commands to car from home and vice versa, such collaborations would add new customers by offering them a new way to interact with their cars and shop at Amazon.com especially for regularly bought items. This could strengthen its clientele for Prime and ‘Pay with Amazon’ to build a strong sense of trust and service.Final WordAmazon is by far the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. and the 8thbiggest retailerby revenue (was 15th in 2012) and is rapidly spreading its wings in Europe and Asia. With Amazon’s expansion into newer segments such as connected cars, increasing number of Prime members which constitute half of its ‘Pay with Amazon’ users, and more and more businesses going online, there’s high probability that Amazon Payments will steadily garner a bigger market share and emerge as a strong revenue driver for the company in the future."

Strong Econ Data to Sway March Fed Decision?;2/15/2017;"Wednesday, February 15, 2017makeArticleAd();New economic data relevant to a possible Fed interest rate decision next month has hit the tape prior to today's opening bell. Retail Sales, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Empire State Manufacturing Survey have reported figures higher than expected by analysts, pointing toward inflation building within the U.S. economy.Retail Sales beat expectations, coming in at +0.4% on the headline number. Key within this report is when one strips out auto sales, that number jumps to +0.8%. Year over year, Retail Sales are up 2.3%; you'd have to go back to 2008 to see a higher read than that. Even though retailers overall struggled during the 2016 holiday season, at least some of this rests on headwinds from competition from AmazonAMZN. What we instead see through reports like this is actual inflation creeping into the retail space.Speaking of Retail, President Trump meets with top executives from retail majors such as TargetTGT, GapGPS, Best BuyBBYand J.C. PenneyJCP. Based on how much of these companies' inventory is manufactured outside the U.S., it appears quite likely issues like Trump's border tax proposal will be discussed thoroughly today.Today's CPI number of +0.6% also looks hot - and it's the same as the Producer Price Index (PPI) read from yesterday. Ex-food & energy, this read falls to 0.3%, implying much of the heat is coming from those two components. Sifting through the details bears this out: on a month-over-month basis, gasoline prices have shot up 7.8%. Commodities were up another 1% and Airlines +2%, although airfares are down 3.3% year over year.The main inflation read in this report is a year-over-year figure of 2.5%. Align this with the testimony we heard from Fed Chair Janet Yellen yesterday (which she will continue today), and what we see is the Fed closely watching economic stability under the fledgling Trump administration as well as inflationary levels such as in reports like these. Meaning a March rate hike looks firmly on the table at this point.The market has not yet priced in the possibility of a new quarter-point hike (to 75-100 basis points), but market futures are down slightly ahead of the bell. Then again, we are seeing historic highs being reached in the main indexes of late - thanks to a Republican-led tax cut scenario in both the Legislative (Congress) and Executive (White House) branches of government - so perhaps this is just the market taking a breather.Finally, the Empire State read blossomed to 18.7% for the month of February, up from 16.5% in January. This is the highest figure in over two years, and more than double the expectations from analysts of 7.5% growth in the manufacturing economy of New York State. New orders and shipments both spiked up in this latest read; this is a rather volatile survey month over month, but it also represents strong economic growth for the second straight report.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Better still, revenue as well as profits per share of MGM stock took a decided turn for the better during the third quarter of 2016, suggesting the casino operator was finally shaking off the funk from a 2015governmental crackdown on China's gambling enclave … Macau.makeArticleAd();Was Q3 just a stroke of luck, or is MGM Resorts really on the mend? Owners of MGM stock will get an answer to that question before the market opens on Thursday morning.Here's what investors need to know.MGM Resorts Earnings PreviewIt hasn't been an easy couple of years for MGM Resorts International. Although the stock is well up since February of last year, the bulk of that gain has been made more on hope and less on actual results.The company, along with other casino names, has been digesting the impact of a government-induced slowdown in Macau - once considered a panacea for casino operators - and a growth slowdown in gambling activity here in the United States asonline and offline alternatives continue to proliferate.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayAnd yet, just as the industry begins work on rekindling growth of the U.S. market, in January Macau's casino's logged a sixth straight month of year-over-year improvement in gaming revenue.At the same time, while operators in the United States seems to be fighting more competitors for fewer dollars, owners of MGM stock can celebrate the fact that the company can expand its footprint, profitably. In its first full month of operation (January),MGM Resorts' National Harbor casino in Oxon Hill, Maryland became the state's most played gaming venue.In other words, MGM Resorts is heading into its fourth-quarter report with a tailwind.As of the latest look, analysts expect the casino and resort outfit to report earnings of 20 cents per share of MGM stock on revenue of $2.46 billion. The company lost six cents per share on $2.192 billion in sales for the same quarter a year earlier. MGM Resorts blew away its Q3 expectations, underscoring three quarters worth of much-needed progress.In fact, MGM hastopped earnings estimates in each of its prior three quarters.Three Things to Watch for MGM StockWhile MGM Resorts has been and continues to be a multi-faceted company, the foreseeable future for MGM stock largely depends on three specific matters. In no certain order …MacauWhile Macau's casino industry is on the mend, there's still plenty of repair work that needs to be done. Case in point: While Macau's January revenue was up a healthy 3.1%, that still fell short of expectations. MGM needs Macau's growth potential. The region only makes up about a tenth of the company's business, but it could be much more if the Chinese enclave continues to rebound.Online GamingWhile MGM is increasingly competing with online alternatives, don't think it's not in the business itself. MGM Resorts now completely owns Atlantic City's Borgata,which gives it access to the state's legal online gambling market. Last year's online revenue for New Jersey was a pittance to the now-parent company, but with a stronger name to leverage, MGM may well make this growing venue a viable one. And that's just one state where online gaming is now allowed. Several more offer it, representing a new opportunity for the casino operator.JapanThe idea first surfaced late last year, and the chatter hasn't abated … Japan may be on the verge of legalizing casino gambling the way Macau did. If that happens, look for that nation's casino scene to become the next Macau. Only bigger. The company has already said it'sready to commit $10 billion to establish a presence there, and there's no reason to think it won't pull that trigger to be the first one to set up shop.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Bottom Line on MGMRegardless of how things pan out on Thursday, MGM Resorts International is a company on a turnaround path, and it remains one of the more compelling prospects in the industry. As JPMorgan's analystsput itearlier in the month:""We continue to believe that MGM possesses the best risk-reward in gaming, with ~65% of its cash flows coming from the Las Vegas Strip (and only ~10% exposure to Macau), a market with no new supply growth and group/convention momentum, which should allow it to garner continued attractive (and above U.S. lodging industry) overall room pricing and non-gaming, out of the room spend growth aided by incremental EBITDA coming from the T-Mobile Arena and Park related investments.""In other words, MGM Resorts is doing well where it needs to - Las Vegas - while other names in the business likeLas Vegas Sands Corp.(NYSE:LVS) remain bogged down by anover-commitmentto a still-tough Macau market. Macau (and then Japan and online gaming) is just a little gravy. A bearish response from MGM stock to the Q4 report may still be a buying opportunity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postIs MGM Resorts International (MGM) Stock the Best Casino Bet?appeared first onInvestorPlace."
PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) Q4 Earnings Leave Coke in the Dust;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) laid another beat-down on its supposed rival,The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO), with its fourth-quarter earnings. While PEP stock wasn't doing much Wednesday morning, the company still proved once again that its strategy of combining food and drinks is the right one.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)For the quarter ending in December, PepsiCo had $1.401 billion (97 cents per share) in net income on revenue of $19.515 billion. For the year, net income was up 16% year-over-year, to $6.329 billion ($4.36), on revenue that was fractionally lower $62.799 billion.Stories about the earnings and PEP stock differed on their angles.Reuters said the company wasprofitingfrom its focus on healthy snacks and drinks. USA Today noted that profit was down and saidsugary drinks face hurdles. MarketWatch fretted overthe impact of the strong dollarand CEO Indra Nooyi's prediction the company would face ""global challenges"" in 2017.But isn't that what Bill Belichick always says, too? That we're always facing challenges, but if we just do our job, we'll win?It seems to work.Fat on Fried FoodThe key difference between Coke and Pepsi is strategic. KO only does drinks, while PEP also does food.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayPepsi owns both Frito-Lay, whose sales were up 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and Quaker Foods, whose North American profit was also up 10% year-over-year. Coke, by contrast, has steadfastly refused to go outside its niche of drinks since selling Columbia Pictures in 1989.Pepsi has also been ahead of Coca-Cola on consumer trends, switching toorganic ingredients for Gatoradeand now claiming to get45% of its revenue now from ""guilt-free"" productswith less sugar and fat than before.Had your retirement fund bought stock in both soft drink giants after the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Coke's home town, Pepsi's performance would have quadrupled Coke's gains, and that's not even counting the 1997Yum! Brands, Inc.(NYSE:YUM) spin-off. Stock in YUM originally worth $4 billion is now worth $25 billion.The gap has mostly widened under Nooyi, who has now been CEO of Pepsico for almost 10 years.Over the past five years, gains in Pepsi have tripled those of Coca-Cola, and under Nooyi the dividend on PEP stock has doubled to the current 75 cents per share. The stock is considered a poor income play only because it has delivered fat capital gains, doubling in value since the bottom of the last recession.Again, a Belichick-like performance.What Comes Next for PEP Stock?Some analysts,like our own Nelson Smith, have written of suggestions that Pepsi spin-out its food unit for a 20% gain, then make a run atMondelez International Inc(NASDAQ:MDLZ), which sells higher-end candy and cookie brands like Cadbury and Oreo.But Nooyi, who is now ranked as the second most-powerful woman on the planet, would probably tell critics not to over-think things. She says her key skill is being able to simplify complex subjects, turning masses of numbers into simple stories. Nooyi's troops will be in Sundance, looking for film projects, good stories, it can back with product placements.LendingClub Corp (LC) Stock Isn't Doomed After Q4 Earnings, But ...Nooyi can tell critics that Pepsi is a standout in a lackluster industry, and that they should watchthe ""zero calorie"" strategy the company launched at the recent Super Bowl. (Belichick won that one, too.)The Bottom LineWhile Coke has recently changed managers, announcing that James Quincey will succeed Muktar Kent as CEO in May, Pepsi is a picture of stability. PEP stock has a solid track record of gains, both stock gains and dividend increases, going back eight years now, and is being proclaimed by some as""one name to own forever.""It's hard to argue with the track record. In its competition with Atlanta, Pepsi management is the one with all the rings.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Evaluating Counter-Trend Opportunities In Retail ETFs;2/15/2017;"Retail stocks have become a highly-publicized area of the market in recent years as the continued struggle for brick and mortar relevance battle the efficiency of online sales.  The trend has been exacerbated with the steady expansion of retail juggernautAmazon Inc(AMZN) into more and more households.  The strength of Amazon has unavoidably weighed on the share prices of more traditional retailers that find themselves strung with slowing sales and inescapable costs.There is no doubt that consumerism is alive and well in the heart of the American economy.  Which is why it’s worth considering if the pendulum of momentum will eventually swing back in the direction of numerous stalwart retail competitors.One way to gauge and potentially invest in this trend is through diversified exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track a basket of retail stocks.  TheSPDR S&P Retail ETF(XRT) is by far the largest and most widely followed ETF in this space.  XRT owns approximately 100 shares of publicly-traded retail companies that are primarily domiciled in the United States.  This includes industry sub-sectors such as apparel, automotive, food, department stores, drug stores, specialty retail, and electronics.  The fund currently has $850 million in total assets and charges a net expense ratio of 0.35%.makeArticleAd();The most interesting feature of XRT may be its equal-weighted composition.  Each stock within the index is given an equally proportionate share of the asset allocation to provide smaller companies the opportunity of making a meaningful impact on performance.  Companies like AMZN are given the same weighting asCostco Wholesale Corp(COST),Ulta Beauty Inc(ULTA) andWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(WBA) at each rebalancing period.It’s worth noting that the price trend of XRT has been quite volatile over the last several years with little net gain overall.  This tug-of-war among the underlying holdings demonstrates a lack of definable trend for the group amid a roller coaster of peaks and valleys.Perhaps the more important issue with the performance of retail stocks is how strong the rest of the market has been in their absence.  The ratio of momentum between XRT and theSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY) just recently hit a new three year low to start off 2017.Investors who are seeking contrarian or deep value plays may be intrigued by the potential for a turnaround in the retail sector.  However, the greatest challenges will be in timing this momentum swing and selecting an appropriate way to play it.XRT is the obvious investor favorite based on its size and longevity.  Nevertheless, there remain alternative options in the ETF category that make compelling cases as well.The next largest competitor is theVanEck Vectors Retail ETF(RTH), which has $72 million in assets and charges a similar 0.35% expense ratio.  RTH varies its approach by honing in on just the 25 largest retail names in a more traditional market-cap weighted structure.  Because of its index construction criteria, AMZN accounts for 17% of the underlying exposure, withHome Depot Inc(HD) andWal-Mart Stores Inc(WMT) rounding out the top holdings.The newly launchedAmplify Online Retail ETF(IBUY) is another intriguing option as well.  This fund focuses on 40 publicly traded stocks that derive more than 70% of their revenue from online sales. IBUY follows a modified equal weight index methodology to create a level playing field across all its underlying holdings.This ETF also captures multiple market cap segments and contains some modest international exposure as well.  IBUY is truly designed for those investors who believe in the continued trend of online retail sales growth and profitability.  Nevertheless, investors should be aware that the unique strategy charges an expense ratio of 0.65%, which is on the high side for its peer group.The Bottom LineSector investing is often a hit-or-miss endeavor that can be fraught with missteps in timing or execution.  ETFs of this nature are generally more appropriate as smaller tactical holdings to supplement core, broad-market exposure.  This allows you to participate in the returns of the sector without significantly overweighting your allocation towards a single industry trend.Furthermore, those who are considering using a retail ETF should carefully evaluate the underlying index construction criteria as there are many varying methods within this group.  The allocation of capital to stocks within each unique fund will play a meaningful role in its overall performance."
LendingClub Corp (LC) Stock Isn’t Doomed After Q4 Earnings, But …;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeading into the company's fourth quarter earnings report, things were looking up forLendingClub Corp(NYSE:LC). LendingClub did dip a bit ahead of its Q4 earnings release, but LC stock still was up by more than 80% from its May lows below $4. A solid Q3 report, plus a billion-dollar funding deal, established that the business had stabilized.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Simon Cunningham via Flickr (Modified)That didn't mean LendingClub's problems were fixed, of course. LC stock still trades well off post-IPO highs above $25. LendingClub itself is unprofitable, if modestly so. But it appeared that the worst of the company's problems were behind it - hopefully.New management was rebuilding investor trust - particularly after a scandal involving former CEO Renaud Laplanche. Funders were back, including the recent $1.3 billion investment from a subsidiary of theNational Bank of Canada(OTCMKTS:NTIOF). And LendingClub originated nearly $2 billion in loans in its third quarter, in line with its plans. Some of those originations required LendingClub to pay incentives to entice lenders to stick with the platform, which took $11 million off Q3 earnings. But those payments stopped in September - further evidence that the business had normalized.LendingClub earnings on Tuesday evening seem to support that narrative - yet LC stock sold off by 9% on Wednesday regardless.But the negative reaction makes some sense. LendingClub may have stabilized its operations, but this is where the hard work begins.Why LC Stock Declined After Q4 EarningsLendingClub's fourth-quarter earnings did beat analyst expectations. An adjusted net loss of 2 cents per share beat the Street by a penny. A revenue decline of 4% was five points better than the consensus.But the numbers also illustrate a company still working to rebound from its 2016 struggles.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteWhile loan originations increased against the previous quarter (albeit by less than 1%), they were down 23% year-over-year. Revenue yield (revenue as a percentage of originations) rose sharply, but mostly due to higher fees. Adjusted EBITDA reversed from positive $25 million a year ago to a loss of over $2 million in Q4 2016.The larger issue appears to be 2017 guidance. In the LendingClub earnings release, the company forecast revenue of $565 million-$595 million. That figure came in below analyst estimates, which averaged $597 million. LC does expect to return to EBITDA profitability, with that figure projected at $40 million-$55 million after a full-year loss in 2016. But even those levels suggest a decline from 2015, when LendingClub earned almost $70 million on that basis.All told, there's a bit of a ""sell the news"" feeling to the market's reaction.Investors have bid up LC stock over the past few months in advance of the business stabilizing. That stabilization appears to have occurred. Banks have returned to the platform, funding 31% of loans in Q4 against just 13% in Q3. Originations were just shy of $2 billion, in line with company targets. All told, LendingClub earnings show a company that is past the worst of its problems.The catch is that LendingClub stock is priced for a bit more than that.LendingClub Stock In 2017Even accounting for $800 million in cash, and assuming LendingClub hits the high end of 2017 guidance, the stock still trades at about 30 times next year's adjusted EBITDA. That figure includes some $91 million in stock-based compensation - nearly twice the midpoint of projected profitability.Guidance also suggests a GAAP loss for the full year, and narrow profitability (~8 cents per share at the high end) on an adjusted basis.LC stock still is pricing in a reasonable amount of growth. To be sure, revenue guidance suggests a solid increase year-over-year of about 17%. The concern is costs. Excluding one-time and non-cash effects (but including share-based comp), operating expenses increased 43% in 2016. Sales and marketing deleveraged in Q4 as well, according to the LendingClub earnings call. And the company expects ""elevated"" marketing spend in the first half of 2017 -along with continued EBITDA losses.Part of the immediate reaction to LendingClub earnings, then, likely comes from management essentially pushing expectations out to the back half. But from a long-term standpoint, that hardly breaks the bull case for LendingClub stock. Some of the first-half pressure is coming from efforts to improve long-term growth. Expenses related to the rollout of auto refinancing, higher marketing, and tighter credit all are pressuring first-half margins.Trade of the Day: This Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Dip Is a BuyInvestors betting on a long-term turnaround in LC stock, then, shouldn't necessarily be dissuaded by the Q4 report.LC Stock: Buy It or Sell It?The concern I have is that, even with LendingClub stock well off its all-time highs, the stock still isn't cheap. It's not even close.On the LendingClub earnings call, CFO Tom Casey said it was important to exit 2017 with adjusted EBITDA higher than stock-based compensation. That performance - should LC get there - is a far cry from supporting an enterprise value that still is more than $1.5 billion at early Wednesday prices.Similarly, a goal of 20% margins at $565 million implies just ~$115 million in EBITDA, or about $25 million less 2017 share issuance. That implies a 60x-plus multiple at current levels, and means LendingClub needs to show a lot more growth to keep LC stock above even $6.From that perspective, the reaction to LendingClub earnings makes some sense. Yes, the company appears to be on the right track. But Q4 earnings and 2017 guidance show just far LC has to go.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

How Safe Is Wal-Mart Stock and Its Dividend?;2/15/2017;"Retail giantWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) has long enjoyed a significant competitive advantage   thanks to its massive scale. Wal-Mart is able to get the best   prices from its suppliers and pass those savings onto its   customers, making it next to impossible for traditional retailers   to compete on price.But the continued rise of e-commerce has changed the equation,   putting Wal-Mart in a position where it's playing catch-up withAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Wal-Mart has gotten far more serious about   e-commerce in recent years, acquiring Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3   billion, rolling out an online grocery pick-up and delivery   service, and just recently launching free two-day shipping in an   effort to undercut Amazon Prime. But it remains well behind the   e-commerce leader.Image source: Wal-Mart.makeArticleAd();Wal-Mart's U.S. store business is still performing well,   producing a long streak of positive comparable-sales growth   thanks in part to initiatives like higher wages and better   training for employees. But that business will no doubt begin to   feel pressure as online sales grow as a percentage of total   retail sales. Profits have taken a dive as Wal-Mart invests in   e-commerce and in-store initiatives, and an earnings recovery   will require these investments to pay off in the long run.With the retail business changing rapidly, is Wal-Mart stock a   safe bet? And what about the dividend? With slumping profits, is   the quarterly payout at risk?A solid dividendWal-Mart has not historically been a great dividend stock, in   part because the stock price was soaring right along with the   dividend prior to 2000. The yield was consistently below 1% until   the mid-2000s, when the stock price began to stagnate. The yield   has steadily risen since then, currently sitting right around   3%.WMT Dividend Yield (TTM)data byYCharts.Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning that it has raised   its dividend annually for at least 25 years. In Wal-Mart's case,   the dividend has been increased annually since the very first   payment in 1974. This long track record doesn't guarantee that   the dividend will continue to increase going forward, but it   shows that the company has been disciplined over the years in   regards to capital allocation.Wal-Mart's current quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, with   a total annual payout of $2 per share. Based on its adjusted   earnings guidance for fiscal 2017, results for which the company   will report on Feb. 21, the payout ratio is currently around 47%.   This gives Wal-Mart some breathing room, even though earnings   will be down compared to previous years.Wal-Mart's dividend growth will likely be slow as the company   diverts its resources to building out its e-commerce business.   But I suspect that it will remain a dividend aristocrat for the   foreseeable future.Elevated risksThe risk of future profit declines is certainly higher today   than it was before the company needed to care very much about   e-commerce. Not only is there the threat of declining in-store   sales as consumers shift online, but Wal-Mart is competing in   e-commerce against a company that has been operating with   razor-thin margins, and sometimes no margins at all, since its   founding.Amazon generates lower margins than Wal-Mart, but Amazon also   spends prodigiously on everything from content for its streaming   service to a $1.5 billion air hub to help shuttle around   merchandise. Wal-Mart will almost certainly be more focused and   disciplined with its e-commerce investments, which should help   keep the bottom line intact.The worst-case scenario for Wal-Mart would be a failure to   grow e-commerce sales rapidly despite its major investments   coupled with declining in-store sales. That scenario would almost   certainly lead to earnings stagnation or decline, eventually   putting the dividend at risk. The best-case scenario, strong   e-commerce sales growth and solid store performance, would   eventually lead to earnings growth.Wal-Mart stock trades for around 16 times the company's   guidance for full-year adjusted earnings. That's not bargain   territory, but it does represent a discount to the overall   market. Any company going through a major transition is   inherently risky, but it looks like the steps Wal-Mart is taking   are the right ones. Wal-Mart stock comes with risks, but not   nearly as many as most other retailers.10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Breakout Alert: Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBanking stocks and the rest of the financial sector led the market higher on Tuesday for a second straight day. This resulted in plenty of chart breakouts in important bank stocks such asWells Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC). One day does not make a new trend, but the widespread rally in financial stocks - which follows a two-month sideways march - looks promising for higher prices in WFC stock.makeArticleAd();Classic textbook technical analysis teaches that price action is all that matters. It's undeniable: Price is what gets market participants paid. However, over the course of my career, I have come to respect that the news, market structure and some fundamental analysis significantly improves the probabilities of profitable trading and investing.The rally thus far this week in WFC stock and other bank stocks has marked several charts with clear breakouts from a two-month consolidation phase. But we must be able to contextualize this move, which came on the back of hawkish commentary out of the Federal Reserve and Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen.Being able to decipher context in any stock move based on the news is important for any sector or industry group. However, I constantly see investors fail to do so in the financial sector, which naturally is sensitive interest-rate levels. In other words, when the Fed sounds hawkish, bank stocks (especially in this environment) tend to pop. A dovish Fed has a tendency to lead to lower interest rates, and thus weighs on financials.And that brings me to our analysis of Wells Fargo.WFC Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear weekly chart of Wells Fargo shares, we see that the post-election rally this past November cleanly broke the stock back above its 50-week (yellow) and 200-week (red) moving averages.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThis also coincided with a breakout of the big bull flag-like pattern that I marked with the two purple-dotted parallels.Click to EnlargeWFC stock then slipped into a sideways pattern (marked by the blue box), which thus far this week it has marginally broken out of to the upside.From this angle, WFC stock now looks poised to overtake its 2015 highs and push toward $60 as a next upside target (barring any quick bearish reversal, of course).On the daily chart, we see that during the two-month consolidation phase, Wells Fargo in mid- to late January and through early February continuously found support at its rising 50-day moving average (yellow).Click to EnlargeThis support ultimately helped WFC stock attempt a breakout of the consolidation phase on Monday. The stock finally broke higher on Tuesday on a daily closing basis.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Active investors and traders could look to try Wells Fargo stock from the long side. The $60 area is your next upside target.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've said it before, and I'll say it again:Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will take over the world. While the general public obsesses over bad hair and the color orange, I think we face a bigger threat. Amazon's drones and their uncanny way of doing business will fundamentally alter commerce as we know it. Note that I didn't say ""e-commerce."" When you dominate as much as AMZN stock has, your industry no longer requires a qualifying prefix.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnybody that doubts that AMZN stock could hit the$1,000 marksimply needs to peruse theircustomer serviceoptions.If you ever encounter an issue using Amazon, the company will take care of you promptly. Should you need immediate, on the spot assistance, AMZN will take you to a special menu screen. From there, you enter your phone number, and literally within seconds, you will be directed to a company representative.We all know firsthand how frustrating most customer service experiences are. I wouldn't be surprised if some companies deliberately promote poor service just so you won't call them. This of course is just another reason why Amazon stock is so special. They could rest on their laurels. They could kick back and relax, knowing that their status as king is unchallenged. Yet they still have the same hunger that they did back in the late 1990s.Maybe that's why AMZN stock is one of the greatest investments in history, while generational internet peersNetscapeandLycosarehistory.AMZN Stock Teeing Up for An Explosive 2017I can go on a full-blown rant listing all the reasons why every investor should at least consider Amazon stock, but a recent development in the markets really solidified the bullish argument. As you know, AMZN stock didn't do so well when Donald Trump won the general election on Nov. 8. Within a few days, shares had fallen by as much as 9%. This is understandable considering the bitter and contentious political campaign season.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayEven by the end of 2016, AMZN stock was conspicuously lower than its pre-election result close. However, that changed dramatically at the start of the new year. Amazon stock gained some much-needed traction, and shot above the $800-mark. Since breaching that psychological barrier, AMZN has yet to fall back below it. And for January, Amazon saw a robust 9% return.This is important because January is typically not a good time for Amazon stock. Of all the opening months going back to 1998, shares average an extremely pedestrian 0.6%. However, annual returns from 1998 through 2016 average 84%.Such huge discrepancies made me wonder - are there indicators in January that predict how AMZN stock will do later?Click to EnlargeThe answer is a resounding yes.This past January's performance for AMZN stock was the fourth best overall. Of the three other times that Amazon stock posted better opening months, investors later saw average annual returns of 120%. Inclusive of every positive January, AMZN still nets an amazing average annual return of 100%.That's not all. Of the seven years in which Amazon took a loss, six had Januarys that also incurred red ink. The one exception occurred in 2001, during the immediate aftermath of the tech bubble bursting. As long as January holds up, it's highly unlikely to be on the losing end.Amazon's Fundamentals Look Great Too!I don't recommend making a decision on an opportunity on the basis of a sole metric or indicator. The same can be said about statistical data. Even the best-reasoned and logical calculations can't account for every variable. Just like the election of President Trump, there are certain elements of unpredictability that can and will bite you.Another Take - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?However, with AMZN stock, I think investors have a little more buffer to play with thanks to its solid fundamentals. Primarily, Amazon is still innovating. We saw a bit of that during the Super Bowl commercial featuring Amazon Prime Air. It's also a dominant player in cloud computing, frustrating companies likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).And while I acknowledge it's risky for AMZN stock if it doesn't work out, I like Amazon's venture into groceries. Granted, I'm not crazy on possible rumors that the company is thinking about rolling out2,000 stores. But if they do this right - particularly in trendy places like their Seattle hometown - AMZN could have another winner on its hands.These underlying drivers provide the confidence for investors willing to bet that Amazon stock will hit quadruple digits. However, what can't be denied is the momentum. When AMZN gets hot, it almost always stays hot. For many, that will be the nudge they need to make their final decision.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe postWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Move Over China: India's the Best Place to Invest Right Now;2/14/2017;"(1:30) - Apple to begin iPhone manufacturing in India(6:15) - Tesla speculates opening the doors into India's   Market(9:15) - Internet Expansion   in India(13:35) - Amazon's Big Investment into India(21:30) - India's influencing infrastructure(25:25) - Stock Re-capWelcome to Episode #70 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Neena Mishra, Zacks Director of ETF Research and also the editor ofZacks Income Investor.But she's not on the show this week to talk about ETFs or income stocks. No, she's joining Tracey to discuss a far more important topic: the investing opportunities in India.Neena just returned from a trip to India where she noticed that there was a lot more optimism about the economy.Prime Minister Modi has been trying to institute economic reforms to open up India's economy, which has been notoriously closed off to foreign investment. Given the developments over the last few years, it looks like he is succeeding.While many American technology and social media companies are shut out of China for various reasons, India has seemingly opened its doors. With 1.2 billion people, and growing, many companies would love to tap that consumer base.With one of the largest populations of Millennials in the world, and a growing middle class, 2017 could be the year of India.Tracey and Neena discuss 5 ways in which investors can invest in India's rising economic power, without even leaving the shores of the United States.5 Stocks to Play the Indian Growth Story1.AppleAAPLonly has 2% of India's smartphone market. Estimated at 300 million, and growing, that's just a small sliver of the market. But until 2017, it hasn't been able to open Apple retail stores in the country. Thanks to a deal to manufacture the phones in India, which will bring costs of the phones down for consumers, Apple could soon be tapping India's growing elite.2.TeslaTSLAappears to be poised to enter the India market after CEO Elon Musk tweeted out in February 2017 that it is looking to enter India in mid-2017. There are also rumors that a long-awaited Tesla Asia manufacturing plant may get the green light in India, instead of China. Stay tuned.3.FacebookFBhas long been shut out of the massive Chinese market, but that's not the case in India. One problem in India, however, has been the poor Internet infrastructure. There are just 250 million data subscribers, although that number is growing quickly. In 2016, Facebook tried to give away the Internet in India but was shot down by the government. However, data companies have been quickly expanding which is helping Facebook's reach. In the fourth quarter of last year, India was Facebook's fastest growing market.4.AmazonAMZNhas put the most on the line in India as it has already spent about $5 billion to expand its fulfillment centers and delivery service in the country. Amazon Prime has launched in 100 cities. 10% of India's population speaks English, which makes it the second largest English speaking country, after the United States, in the world. It's facing competition, however, from Alibaba and homegrown FlipKart and Snapdeal. But it has launched Amazon Video and a recent 3-day Great Indian Sale saw sales growth surge over 200% compared to a regular shopping day.5.NetflixNFLXhas an aggressive international expansion plan, and it includes India. In December 2016, just as Amazon Video launched, Netflix announced a partnership with Bollywood movie star and producer, Shah Rukh Khan. Right now, Neena says Netflix is charging around $10 a month for its streaming service. That is high for India. But, again, companies are looking at the growth potential.What else should you know about India and investing in its hot growth story in 2017?Find out the answers to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitmakeArticleAd();Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Amazon.com Gives a New Clue About Prime Member Numbers;2/14/2017;"One ofAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) most closely guarded metrics is how many Amazon   Prime members there are. For years, Amazon has merely referred to   its Prime member base as being in the ""tens of millions."" The   company has used that language since 2013, leaving investors to   speculate where in the 20 million to 90 million range the figure   actually sits.But third-party research firms are always happy to suggest   some estimates. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)   regularly puts out estimates, with the most recent being from   October 2016, pegging Amazon's Prime member base at 65 million.   Meanwhile, we know that Amazon should have at least66 millionPrime members by now, based on the growth rates and figures that   Amazon has disclosed over the years.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Well, the company has finally started to give clearer clues as   to its Prime member base.Saying more while still saying nothingAmazon recently filed its 2016 10-K, and for the first time it   has started disclosing a new category of sales called ""retail   subscription services,"" which includes ""annual and monthly fees   associated with Amazon Prime membership, as well as audiobook,   e-book, digital video, digital music, and other subscription   services."" This metric totaled $6.4 billion last year, and has   grown significantly over the past three years.Data source: Amazon 10-K. Chart by author.If we were to take the figure at face value and do the   super-complicated math of dividing sales by Prime's cost of $99   per year, that would imply about 64.5 million Prime members. But   it's not so clear-cut for a few reasons.For starters, theaveragemembership fee is impossible to calculate. Amazon offers   discounted memberships for students; Prime receives regular   promotions that reduce the fee, like a Black Friday deal in 2016   that knocked off $20; Prime is available in many countries, each   with varying (and often lower) fees that are subject to volatile   currency translation; some members may pay monthly instead of   yearly, which costs more ($132 instead of $99).Additionally, Amazon sells all sorts of subscriptions that   likely fall into this category, from digital content to dog   food.Amazon also accounts for the Prime membership fees it collects   in different ways, allocating portions to product sales and   service sales while amortizing those amounts over the   subscription term; some of the revenue remains deferred, while   the new metric only includes recognized revenue. Another portion   of the fee is even allocated as shipping revenue.In other words, while Amazon's new disclosure around retail   subscription revenue provides yet another data point for   investors to scrutinize and analyze, the company has done a good   job of splitting up the allocation of Prime fees for accounting   purposes in a way that still obfuscates how many Prime members   there are. It's safe to say that memberships are in the ballpark   of 65 million to 70 million at this point, and at the rate that   Amazon is adding Prime members, it'll be less than two years   until it changes its language from a vague ""tens of millions"" to   a still-vague ""over a hundred million.""Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

Better Buy: Baidu Inc. vs. Amazon.com Inc.;2/14/2017;"Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) have both beenveryprofitable plays for long-term shareholders. Shares of Baidu have   risen 1,480% over the past ten years, while shares of Amazon have   surged 2,050%.Baidu and Amazon probably won't repeat those massive gains   over the next decade, but both tech giants remain solid   investments -- Baidu is the top search engine in China, and   Amazon is the biggest e-commerce site and cloud platform provider   in the world. Let's compare both company growth trajectories and   valuations to see which is a better buy at current prices.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How fast are Baidu and Amazon growing?Baidu's revenue grew 35% in fiscal 2015, but it's only   expected to rise 6% in fiscal 2016 when it reports its full-year   earnings on Feb. 23. That slowdown was mainly caused by a   government crackdown on misleading ads (especially for healthcare   products) across its sites, aswap of its stakein online travel agencyQunarwith its rivalCtrip, and the overall slowdown of the Chinese economy.But once those headwinds fade, Baidu's top line is expected to    grow 20% in fiscal 2017. That growth will likely be fueled   by its investments in new and adjacent markets, like O2O   (online-to-offline) services which integrate new services into   its core mobile app, driverless vehicles, and artificial   intelligence.Amazon's revenue rose 20% in fiscal 2015, 27% in fiscal 2016,   and is expected to rise another 22% this year. That consistent   growth can be attributed to the rapid growth of its core   marketplace businesses and the growth of AWS (Amazon Web   Services), the biggest cloud platform in the world. During fiscal   2016, AWS revenues surged 55% and accounted for 9% of its top   line -- compared to 7% in 2015.How profitable are Baidu and Amazon?Most of Baidu's revenues come from ads, which have much higher   margins than Amazon's main marketplace business. However, Baidu's   operating margins have gradually declined over the past few   years, due to the ramp up in its spending on O2O services and   other businesses. Meanwhile, Amazon's operating margins have   gradually improved due to the growth of AWS, which has much   higher margins than its marketplace business.Source:YCharts.Baidu's net income rose 155% in fiscal 2015, but much of that   gain came from the aforementioned share swap with Qunar and   Ctrip. For fiscal 2016, analysts expect Baidu's net earnings to   fall nearly 10% on higher O2O investments in letting users order   meals, hail cabs, make payments, and perform other tasks within   its core app. Baidu needs these features to widen its moat   againstTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) , which squeezes similar features into its   monolithic WeChat app. But looking forward, analysts expect   Baidu's earnings to rebound 33% in 2018 as those ecosystem   investments bear fruit.Amazon's rising operating margins lifted its net income by   125% in 2015 and 298% in 2016. Analysts expect AWS' top line   growth and its steady operating margins to boost its net earnings   by 49% this year and 75% in fiscal 2018. That impressive bottom   line growth will give Amazon more freedom to use loss leading and   low-margin strategies (like additional Prime services, Echo, Fire   TV, Dash buttons) to expand its e-commerce ecosystem. However,   investors should be aware that an ongoing price battle in the   cloud platform market has forced AWS to repeatedly lower its   prices -- so the unit's bottom line growth could still hit a few   speed bumps in the near future.What the valuations tell usBaidu trades at 14 times trailing earnings, which is much   lower than the industry average of 50 for internet information   providers. But its forward P/E of 32 is higher due to its   expected slowdown in earnings growth.Amazon has a trailing P/E of 192, which initially looks lofty   but isn't terribly high relative to its earnings growth in 2016.   Its forward P/E of 65 also looks reasonable compared to earnings   growth expectations for 2017 and 2018.With high-growth internet companies like Baidu and Amazon,   it's also important to check their enterprise value to free cash   flow (EV/FCF) ratios. A lower figure indicates that the company   is ""cheaper"" relative to its free cash flow -- which can be used   to further expand their businesses. As seen in the following   chart, Amazon looksmuchcheaper than Baidu by that key metric.Source:YCharts.The winner: AmazonI own shares of both Baidu and Amazon, and I still recommend   buying both stocks as long-term tech investments. But if I can   only buy one at current prices, I'd buy Amazon because it   exhibits steadier top and bottom line growth with reasonable   valuations. As for Baidu, investors should see if short-term   concerns about its rising expenses punish the stock -- which   could reveal better buying opportunities.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Don’t Buy Into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Until You Consider All Angles;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen I look at the analysis of my fellow InvestorPlace colleagues, I see a recurring pattern. They're bullish onAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), and exceedingly so. Dana Blankenhorn is on record saying that BABA stock willhit all-time highs. James Brumley believes that Alibaba stock willdo the impossible- outperformAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). I, on the other hand, am not too convinced.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThis isn't to say that I don't think those metrics can't come true. For example, I can easily see a case where the Alibaba stock price hits an all-time high. The markets are in a carefully optimistic mood right now. President Donald Trump, while still being the self-anointed king ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), is saying just the right words. Plus, theiShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (ETF)(NYSEARCA:FXI) is near double-digits year-to-date.Therefore, don't be surprised if BABA stock outduels AMZN for a few cycles.So what is my issue with Alibaba stock? There are two concerns that I have: the first, a broader perspective that is rarely discussed, and the second, the lack of technical enthusiasm.BABA stock Can Turn on a DimeLet's tackle the broader concerns, but to do that, I will need to wade into a politically sensitive area. Since our kindergarten and elementary school years, we've been taught that we are all the same. As we become adults, we find that such platitudes - while well-meaning - are not very helpful. People are different. And Asian markets are a lot different than American or western markets. Because of this, comparing BABA stock to an American counterpart is also not helpful.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe reason for this is that the gambling culture is so integrated in Asian cultures that it's not really defined as a social problem. Only when Asian immigrants come to the U.S., for example, dogambling behaviorsbecome quantified as problems. According to numerous Asian-American researchers interviewed byPsychology Today, individual cultures throughout Asia actively promote a gambling ethos.What does this have to do with Alibaba stock? Investors need to be aware that BABA can make you rich, or it can make you poor in a hurry. This is especially true because we just saw a massive collapse in the underlying Chinese markets. Sure, the benchmark FXI is up over 10% this year. However, it's also down more than 23% from its 2015 highs.Plus, we've alreadyseen this showbefore. Back in the late 1980s, many feared Japan would take over the world. This was one of the subtle themes of Hollywood blockbusters likeBlack Rain.Then the collapse happened, and Japanese markets have never looked the same. True, China and Japan have different fundamentals, but it's worth considering when looking at BABA stock.Alibaba Stock Isn'tThatImpressiveI will further argue that a correlation exists between the Asian gambling culture and Alibaba stock's technical performance.Consider the average annual return of BABA. On paper, it's really not that impressive. Between 2014 (which was not a complete year) and 2016, the average is a mere 1.2%. People love BABA stock for its surges in momentum, but that's about it. As a prime example, shares are up 15.5% YTD, but only after dropping 12% between Nov. 8 and the end of December.Click to EnlargeOverall, the history of Alibaba stock isn't that favorable. On the day of its initial public offering, BABA stock closed at $93.89. Presently, shares are trading slightly over $101. That's just an 8% net profit after all this time. The math is pretty clear - BABA is one choppy mess.In China and other Asian markets, they live for this kind of volatility. In America and the West? Not so much.And if we're in the business of comparing Chinese stocks to American stocks, consider Amazon's performance relative to where BABA is now. On its 605th day of trading, AMZN was up almost 4,400% since its first closing price. Of course, that was smack dab in the middle of the tech bubble. But even during the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, AMZN was up more than 216% from its opening drive.Know the Risks Before Buying BABAThis leads me to ask an unavoidable question. If Chinese consumers are truly ringing up the cash registers for discretionary items, why isn't BABA doing better? They've already beaten their regional rivals likeJD.Com Inc(ADR)(NASDAQ:JD). Plus, everybody has presented otherwise excellent arguments for its imminent rise higher.Why Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Still Needs to Prove ItselfIf you were to hold BABA stock long-term, it really didn't do you any good. If you traded it, and traded it well, however, it's a different story.This brings me to a sensitive conclusion. When you talk about Alibaba stock, you have to look at it from all angles, especially the cultural one. BABA can work for you, but boy, you have to know what you're getting yourself into.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postDon't Buy Into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Until You Consider All Anglesappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Bitcoin Meets Starbucks: iPayYou's Bold Bet Goes Live;2/14/2017;"By Michael ScottWith 2017 in full motion, Bitcoin’s price climb to the mid-$900 range and beyond continues to raise eyebrows. For many, this milestone is just one signal of cryptocurrency’s growing repute as a legitimate store of investment value.Little attention, however, has been given to Bitcoin’s utility as a day-to-day method of payment. Practical use cases involving consumer adoption, in fact, are rarely talked about. This is despite the well-documented cost, efficiency and security advantages of the Bitcoin payment network for both consumers and businesses alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-based startup company aims to change this through an effort to accelerate the everyday use of Bitcoin for consumers worldwide. Launched in May of 2016,iPayYouis an online platform and digital wallet that promotes the viability of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immediately saw early success through a unique feature known as Pay-by-Twitter — the first online platform site for peer-to-peer payments over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliver a caffeine jolt to the retail sector, iPayYou this past December introduced Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks (SBUX), a new way for coffee aficionados to pay for those espressos and other drinks through the use of Bitcoin.This feature allows users to seamlessly transfer bitcoins from their existing iPayYou Bitcoin wallet to their Starbucks mobile app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer before prompting Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks to automatically withdraw that amount from their iPayYou account. Once deposited into that person’s Starbucks account, purchases can be made via the mobile app at any Starbucks location.This latest addition to the iPayYou platform comes on the heels of iPayYou’s recent gift card integration, allowing Bitcoin to be used for instant gift card purchases from retailers like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTunes (AAPL).These creative payment applications are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwide Director of Amazon Associates. With extensive experience in the world of commerce, including prominent positions at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner developed iPayYou with the intention of establishing a easy-to-use Bitcoin wallet with simple features and low costs.Regarding the strategic collaboration with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader significance of this move is that iPayYou is able to encourage Bitcoins to be spent in ways that its creators intended — for everyday purchases from popular merchants without needing a bank account to do so. This arrangement with Starbucks allows coffee lovers to replenish their primary Starbucks account with their Bitcoin holdings.  We’ve accomplished this feat without Starbucks having to directly accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through this demonstration Starbucks will soon begin accepting Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In terms of advantages for Starbucks regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not only a great investment but is also becoming quite useful in everyday life. Because so many of us are addicted to coffee, being able to use Bitcoin to purchase anything at Starbucks is an enormous win for everyday consumers. And Starbucks will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin users who will now become customers.”Over time, Kavner believes that initiatives like this will encourage merchant acceptance of Bitcoin. “Probably the most important metric that every merchant looks at when deciding what methods of payment to accept is how many new customers will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adoption of Bitcoin has been the relatively limited amount of people who wanted to use Bitcoin for POS transactions. Now, I believe that more and more will.”In terms of what’s next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’re going to continue to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more useful over 2017 and beyond. We are planning on expanding to enable more merchant adoption as well as adding many features that every Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simple to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin already but for the everyday consumer who may not even know what Bitcoin is. We’ll continue to innovate to make Bitcoin easier and more useful for everyone.”"
3 Reasons Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Is a Great Long-Term Bet;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsProctor & Gamble Co(NYSE:PG) has had a tough run over the last year. Downward pressure on the consumer discretionary sector helped keep PG stock gains subdued and shares have underperformed the market over the last year.makeArticleAd();Source:David Brossard(Modified)However, the firm's most recent earnings report suggests that Procter & Gamble has made large strides and that business is picking up speed.While it has had a sluggish few months, long-term investors should see the company's shortcomings as a strength because PG stock largely missed out on the Trump rally, making it a less expensive pick than some of its peers right now.Three Reasons PG Stock Is Still a BuyBusiness Is ImprovingOne of the reasons Procter & Gamble is a good buy is that the company's most recent earnings report paints an encouraging picture of the firm's forward progress. At first glance, the company's sales figures looked lackluster, but once factors like foreign exchange rates, acquisitions and divestures were taken out, organic sales increased by 2% from the previous year.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayNot only that, but the firm beat analysts' earnings-per-share expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. P&G management said they expect to see organic sales and core earnings to continue toincrease in the coming yearas well.Shareholders Are RewardedManagement said it sees its core earnings improving by about 5% each year, and so far PG stock looks on track to meet or even exceed that goal. This is great news for shareholders because it means the firm is likely to keep its promise to reward shareholders in a big way over the next few years.In 2017, shareholders aredue to receivesome $22 billion from Procter & Gamble. The firm plans to return that money to shareholders through stock repurchases as well as dividend hikes. At the moment, PG stock offers a 3% dividend yield, which is much higher than the averageS&P 500company pays out. Plus, most are expecting P&G's dividend to increase substantially in the coming year after last year's disappointing 1% hike.The firm has proven to be a reliable source of income for investors by consistently paying out dividends since 1890. The firm has also raised its payout every year for the past 60, so traders can be confident that they will see annual income from P&G stock.A Defensive BusinessWhile the consumer discretionary sector has taken a bit of a hit in recent months as economic uncertainty caused a pullback in spending, Procter & Gamble's core business is very secure should a recession hit. Under the PG umbrella are brands like Tide and Pampers, which are necessities that will still be in demand even if consumers continue to tighten their spending.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Can Always Brush Things OffNot only that, but P&G's diversified portfolio of products keeps the firm from being overexposed to too much volatility in one segment. In response to calls that the company was getting too big to manage, the firm has been thinning out its portfolio and has dropped more than 100 brands over the last few years in an effort to focus on increasing profits in its most promising businesses. However, Procter & Gamble still maintains 23 different brands that operate across a variety of products and each generates more than $1 billion in annual sales.The Bottom Line on Procter & GamblePG stock has been undergoing a bit of a transformation over the last two years as the company sold off some of its brands and implemented cost-cutting measures. P&G is vulnerable to foreign currency swings as the firm operates in 180 different countries.These factors have weighed on PG stock's share price and kept it from rising alongside the broader market over the past year. However, long-term investors can buy shares of Procter & Gamble now as the firm is poised to make its comeback during 2017. Not only that, but the company's dividend payouts and promise to return $22 billion to shareholders will make the wait for a turnaround much easier to bear.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV7 Dividend Stocks Rewarding Shareholders With a RaiseThe post3 Reasons Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Is a Great Long-Term Betappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Is Netflix Inc. Falling Behind in the World's Fastest Growing Internet Market?;2/14/2017;"Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) launched in India with a lot of fanfare roughly a   year ago as part of its global expansion efforts. Since India is   the world's fastest growing internet and smartphone market, it is   important for Netflix to establish itself in the region. However,   the lure of India's internet growth and entertainment consumption   mean Netflix won't have a free hand in this market for long.In fact, Netflix's brand has failed to strike a chord with   Indian customers. The launch ofAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video service and the growth of the   Hotstar streaming service, owned byTwenty-First Century Fox(NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA) , have posed big challenges for the   company.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Netflix's pricing is a big problemNetflix's biggest problem in India is pricing. In a country   where consumption of pirated content is rampant, Netflix needed   to get its pricing right before anyone else in order to drive   adoption of its service. According to a survey by Irdeto, 66% of   polled customers watch pirated content in India, though 56% of   them could be convinced to pay for content.Image source: Netflix.However, whoever designed Netflix's strategy seems to have   forgotten the gap in the GDP per capita between India and the   company's home market. Netflix priced its basic monthly plan at   INR 500 (roughly $7.50) -- almost equivalent to the price of the   basic plan it charges in the U.S. The premium plan costs INR 800,   almost $11.99 at the current exchange rate, which is identical to   what Netflix charges in the U.S. However, India's GDP per capita   was just $1,750 in 2015, whereas the U.S. stands at about 30   times that. Netflix should have taken this gap into consideration   as its current subscription plans limit its reach to wealthier   audiences only.Then, there's the problem of slow internet speeds and data   costs. According toAkamai, India has the slowest average internet speed in Asia-Pacific at   3.5 Mbps. Additionally, consulting firm Analysys Mason points out   that an average Indian customer spends 2.6% of her annual income   to pay for 1 GB of data a month. This is more than the 0.2% to   0.4% of annual income customers in developed countries spend to   get the same service.High internet costs and sluggish data speeds make Netflix's   subscription plans especially costly as customers will need to   also spend money on a bigger data package. Most content   consumption in the country will take place on smartphones, but an   average smartphone in India generated just 559 MB of data each   month in 2016, which a Netflix stream would consume in just 90   minutes. Therefore, to consume more Netflix content, a user will   have to buy more data and shell out more money above and beyond   subscription costs.Amazon and Hotstar are eating Netflix's lunchNetflix needs to think about India from a longer-term   perspective, as mobile data consumption in the country is   expected to grow at a rapid pace. TheEricssonMobility Report indicates that India's mobile data consumption   will grow to 7 GB per smartphone in 2021 thanks to a drop in data   costs and the growth of high-speed networks.The company needs to keep its subscription costs low until   data costs in India go down. Unfortunately, Netflix failed to do   so and is now losing the market to the likes of Amazon and   Hotstar, who have kept their prices significantly lower.Amazon launched Prime Video in India in Dec. 2016, and the   company sells it as a part of the Prime package, which costs INR   499 (approximately $7.46) annually. Therefore, Amazon's annual   subscription can be had for the same amount a customer would pay   for a month of Netflix. Even if Amazon raises its Prime   membership to INR 999 a year (approximately $15), as expected, it   would still be much cheaper than Netflix's annual cost.What's more, Amazon does not discriminate in the video quality   it provides to customers. Users can enjoy both HD and ultra HD   for a flat subscription fee at Amazon, while Netflix charges a   premium for each category. Amazon also provides expedited   delivery and early access to deals as a part of the Prime   package, giving customers good value for their money.While Amazon is beating Netflix on pricing, Twenty-First   Century Fox's Hotstar is beating Netflix on content -- especially   sports. Hotstar's premium subscription is priced at just INR   199 (just under $3) a month, though there is a free model as well   that gives delayed access to content and also carries   advertisements.In fact, Hotstar is the top video streaming app in India   according to App Annie, with Amazon Prime and Netflix occupying   fifth and ninth positions, respectively. There are two key   factors working in Hotstar's favor: strong local content and   sports. Since Hotstar is under the umbrella of India's biggest   television house -- Star TV -- it has good access to local   content such as popular TV shows from local channels.More importantly, Hotstar gives users access to live sports as   a part of its subscription plan, which is a key differentiator   for it compared to Amazon and Netflix. The app gives users access   to a wide range of sports from cricket to football to tennis,   along with HBO shows such asSilicon ValleyandGame of Thrones.This diverse content, along with reasonable pricing, is one of   the major reasons for Hotstar's success in the region, while   Netflix is lacking on both of those fronts. This is why a new   entrant such as Amazon, which launched almost a year after   Netflix, is already in a better position.Unless Netflix adapts its business model for the Indian   market, it won't find as much success in the country as it has in   so many other markets. The competition will continue to leave it   behind, which should be cause for concern since India's online   video subscribers are expected to exceed 100 million by 2020   (from just 12 million in 2014).10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The company is working on a new operating plan that incorporates this priority and focuses on making TrueCar a more balanced and efficient company that creates value for both car dealers and customers.On the dealer side, the company is progressing well with its dealer coverage that addresses concerns and caters to dealer requirements in a better way. On the product side, TrueCar has recently made research driven product changes to its price report page and registration flow in order to bring more clarity to its marketing message. This has been attracting more real car buyers to TrueCar's platform thus increasing conversion rate. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.On the affinity partner business side, the company launched two big new partnerships with caranddriver.com and Chase Bank. Both these partnerships along with Sam's Club are expected to drive growth in the company's partner channel. On the technology side, TrueCar is proceeding well with its Capsella project aimed at enhancing front-end user experiences and back-end tools and database. Through the Capsella technology, the company took the used car service out of its own data center to Amazon'sAMZNAWS.For the fourth quarter, TrueCar expects revenues between $70 million and $72 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2 million to $3 million. Additionally, it expects units to remain in a range of 205,000 to 210,000.TrueCar, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTrueCar, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|TrueCar, Inc.

Facebook (FB) Gets Rights for Live Streaming Mexican Soccer;2/14/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Facebook Inc.FBhas collaborated with Univision Communications Inc. to live stream 46 Liga MX games for an undisclosed amount. Live streaming of these games (also the playoffs) will be available only in the U.S.Media reports added that the matches will be live streamed on Univision Deportes' Facebook page as well as the latter's video tab but devoid of ads.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way Higher;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of semiconductor powerhouseIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) have bounced over the past two trading days, joining the broader stock market. But unlike many parts of the market - which broke higher from sideways consolidation phases - INTC stock bounced off a critical near-term technical support area.makeArticleAd();This not only promises a further bounce in Intel shares - it allows traders to clearly define their risk.When Intel reported its latest batch of earnings a few weeks ago, its numbers - and its outlook - looked good. However, INTC stock sold off on the news. The post-earnings pullback totaled about 10% by last Friday.Semiconductor stocks as a group currently find themselves at an interesting juncture in the sense that some of the larger stocks in the group trade like a mixed bag of fruit. Intel stock fell after earnings, but now it's bouncing.Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) exhausted itself after earnings last week andhas since dropped, yet the broader semiconductor as represented by theMarket Vectors Semiconductor ETF(MUTF:SMH) continues to plug higher.To me, this says that the trading opportunities should be focused on single-stock technical levels.INTC Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that while Intel continues to hold its 2009 support trendline, it has found plenty of technical resistance around the $38 area since late 2014.Click to EnlargeSo far this area has been rejected three times, most recently following the latest earnings report in January. Note also that the purple-dotted 2009 support line coincides with the 200-week simple moving average (red), making this a critical area of support, currently around the $30-$31 area.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsWhile this support area is of no direct concern to my trade idea in INTC stock today, it is important for greater context.Moving on to the daily chart, we see that Intel stock had a classic ""pop-and-drop"" move on Jan. 27 following its earnings report. This is pretty similar to what we've witnessed in NVDA after its earnings report late last week.Click to EnlargeINTC stock initially popped on Jan. 27, but quickly reversed lower and closed in the red for the day. This set in motion the aforementioned 10% selloff that came to a halt last Friday (at least for now).Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?Last Friday, INTC found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red), which currently also coincides with the 2015 diagonal support line (purple-dotted line). The stock closed well off its intraday lows last Friday. This was followed by an up-day Monday, which in turn led my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator to flash a buy signal for a trade.Traders should eye a next upside target around $36.50, while using last Friday's lows around $34.80 as a last-resort stop-loss.Like what you see?

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) seems unstoppable. This is also one of the biggest problems for AMZN stock. When everyone is in, there is no upside left. Of the 43 analysts now covering Amazon,33 have it rated as a buyand none have it lower than a hold.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the expectations attached to these recommendations are what should give Amazon bulls pause. Most analysts expect sharp acceleration of earnings this year, far beyond what the company has delivered so far, with estimates as high as $17.43 per share in 2018.AMZN is a company which, until recently, never made any money, instead being obsessed with plowing every dollar it could find into growth opportunities.Even after closing the books on 2016 - net income of $2.371 billion, or $4.90 per share on revenue of $135.987 billion - Amazon's profitability still trails that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), which earned $3.034 billion, or 98 cents per share, on revenue of $118.790 billion in the October quarter alone.4 Dow Jones Titans That Are Shooting HigherThe super-bullish stance on Amazon stock is based on the idea that, despite its growth, it still has a long way to grow, and that it will soon extract margins the retail industry has never seen.Forget stopping Amazon, though. But, can anyone hope to contain it?Eye-Popping NumbersAt its Feb. 13 opening price just below $832 per share, Amazon stock is selling at 168 times 2016 earnings. Its market cap of $402 billion represents approximately three times its sales, which is an absurd number for a company that is still, at heart, a retailer. Most retail market caps are a fraction of revenue.But of course, the bulls respond,Amazon isn't really a retailer. Indeed, AMZN is the leading cloud provider, a front-runner in artificial intelligence with Alexa, and is the first ""over the top"" video provider to gain Oscar buzz.All elements of its logistics are for sale, includingpayments, deliveries andeverything in between.Wherever you look with Amazon, you seeeye-popping numbers. It's not just an American growth story anymore,it's a global one.What Can Slow AmazonAmazon doesn't have to be stopped for AMZN stock to suffer. Any sign of a slowdown could cut its value by half, or perhaps even more.Source:FlickrJeff Bezos has been honest about what could happen. He is worried about""trade and protectionist measures""from the new Administration, and he isfiercely opposedto the Administration's recent orders on immigration.Political risks may have moved Bezos to buya $23 million housein Washington D.C. - and politics costs money. However, thosepolitical risks are not just Americanand they are not just physical. A Balkanization of the Internet - the requirement that local data only be used locally, and that citizens of each country read or see only what leaders want - could prove costly to implement. But, it's already happeningin the world of books.Despite efforts to control costs by owning its own logistics,delivery costs remain a concern.Is it Really Good to Be the King?Amazon may be King, but the crown hangs heavy. AMZN managers know thatcompetitors are catching up in the cloud space,Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is challenging Alexa and has the capital to beat it in the cloud, and Amazon's success with tabletshas the potential to threatenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsNo tree grows to the sky, and likewise, no business can conquer the whole world of technology, media and retail. Amazon has a host of challengers wherever its managers look, and its ambitions are also facing political resistance.Does this mean I'm selling out of Amazon stock and predicting a crash? No. But, when everyone's telling you to buy something, that's actually when you should start to worry, and I've started to worry about Amazon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Retail Stocks: What to Watch in 2017;2/13/2017;"2017 has been most unkind to traditional retailers.Data source: YCharts.makeArticleAd();Assailed by the relentless and merciless rise of e-commerce,   brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to adapt to an   increasingly online world. Will this retail destruction continue   in the year ahead? And what are the major retail trends that   investors should watch? Read on to find out.Image source: Getty Images.Department-store carnageSears Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD) -- the parent company of Sears and Kmart --may not survive the year, with these once iconic retailers besieged by a poisonous   combination of plunging sales, massive losses, and dwindling cash   reserves. CEO Eddie Lampert has turned tocreative financing deals and fire salesof most of Sears' best assets to raise the capital needed to fund   the company's operations, but even these drastic measures are   likely to only delay Sears'seemingly inevitable demise.Other department-store chains, such asMacy's(NYSE: M) ,J.C. Penney(NYSE: JCP) , andKohl's(NYSE: KSS) , have also seen theirstock prices plummetas they struggle with falling traffic and declining   comparable-store sales. Consumer buying habits continue toshift awayfrom their core mall-based operations, with department-store   sales down for 11 years in a row, according to data from the   Commerce Department.In response, these chains are attempting to adapt by closing   stores and slashing expenses, but cost cuts can only go so far.   Ultimately, Kohl's and Macy's shareholders' best hope may be a   sale to aprivate equity firmoranother retailer. J.C. Penney has an eventougher road ahead, and if the heavily indebted retailer doesn't significantly   improve its profitability and cash-flow generation, it could head   down a path similar to that of Sears Holdings.All told, the department-store industry appears to be in a   state of secular decline, and these retailers' ongoing struggles   will be a major storyline to watch in 2017.No reprieve for discountersEven discount chains such asTarget(NYSE: TGT) and the mightyWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) have seen their sales and margins dented by   intensifying competition. For decades, these discount chains were   the disruptors; with their wide selection of goods and low   prices, they steadily claimed market share from their   higher-priced and often smaller rivals.Now, however, it's these massive retailers that are losing   share to an even more disruptive threat: the relentless rise of   e-commerce. And this global megatrend is being spearheaded by the   juggernaut that isAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Can anyone challenge Amazon?Without the cost burdens and physical limitations of a store   base, Amazon -- along with itsarmy of third-party sellers-- is able to offer an even wider selection of goods and often   lower prices than its still primarily brick-and-mortar   rivals.Even more worrisome for traditional retailers is that Amazon   dominates consumer mindshare when it comes to shopping online. In   fact, areportby marketing firm BloomReach shows that 55% of consumers   begin their searches on the e-commerce titan's website when   shopping online, up from 44% in 2015. During that time, the   percentage of shoppers whose searches originated at all other   retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%, with search   engines holding the remaining share. It appears that ""Amazon"" is   increasingly becoming synonymous with shopping in the minds of   consumers.To combat this trend, Wal-Mart and Target are investing   aggressively in their e-commerce operations. Target islargely focusedon improving its website, strengthening its supply chain, and   utilizing more of its stores to fulfill online orders. Wal-Mart's   efforts are highlighted by its$3.3 billion acquisitionof e-commerce start-up Jet.com, which the company hopes will help   it gain ground on Amazon.Yet even with these heavy investments, Wal-Mart and Target's   e-commerce businesses are still only a fraction of the size of   Amazon's online retail operations. Still, investors shouldn't   completely dismiss Wal-Mart and Target as threats to Amazon's   dominance, and the battle between these giants will be   interesting to watch in the year, and years, ahead.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Shopify Earnings: What Investors Should Expect;2/13/2017;"Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) will look to extend its flawless record of earnings   beats on Wednesday morning before the market opens.Shopify provides the backbone for some 325,000 online stores,   offering an easy way to set up an online store. It charges a   monthly fee for its core service. On top of that, it offers   additional services such as payment processing and shipping, for   which it takes a cut of each sale.Shares of Shopify are up about 27% since the company reported   its third-quarter earnings results. The share price is now   trading around its all-time high. Investors are expecting strong   results from the company, whose revenue growth has been huge, but   which has yet to turn a profit. Here's what investors should   expect from Shopify's fourth-quarter earnings.makeArticleAd();Data source: YCharts.Analysts expectations and Shopify's outlookThe consensus on the Street is that Shopify brought in around   $121.69 million in revenue for the fourth quarter. That's on the   high end of management's range of $120 million to $122   million.Analysts expect that revenue to translate into a $0.02 loss   per share. That's also in line with management's outlook for an   adjusted operating loss of $1 million to $3 million. Shopify also   provided a GAAP outlook of $10 million to $12 million in   operating losses for the quarter.But Shopify has consistently outperformed its revenue outlook   over the past year.QuarterOutlookActualQ4 2015$59 million-$61 million$70.2 millionQ1 2016$65 million-$67 million$72.7 millionQ2 2016$79 million-$81 million$86.6 millionQ3 2016$93 million-$95 million$99.6 millionQ4 2016$120 million-$122 million?Data source: Shopify quarterly reportsGiven Shopify's history of conservative outlooks, the Street   may be underestimating the company's fourth-quarter results. It   wouldn't be a huge surprise if Shopify once again beats analysts'   expectations.Image source: ShopifyKey metrics to watchThere are several important operating metrics for investors to   pay attention to. First and foremost is the company's total   merchants. The number passed 325,000 in the third quarter, up   from 200,000 the year before.In the fourth quarter last year, Shopify added around 43,000   new merchants, an extremely strong quarter. Management said this   year's fourth quarter will be strong once again, but it tempered   expectations, noting that it reports milestones throughout the   year (e.g., 325,000) instead of exact numbers. Depending on when   it passes those milestones within the quarter, it could make   fourth-quarter additions look smaller.Another factor to pay attention to is the split between   subscription solutions revenue and merchant solutions revenue.   Subscription revenue is driven by the growing number of merchants   on the platform, and it's growing more slowly than merchant   solutions revenue. Merchant solutions (payment processing,   shipping, and the like) should surpass subscription revenue in   the fourth quarter, especially considering retail sales tend to   increase during the holidays.It's worth noting that merchant solutions revenue carries a   lower margin than subscription revenue, so Shopify may experience   some margin pressure. Ultimately, however, wide adoption of   merchant solutions from its merchants should support subscription   solutions as it makes the product stickier for Shopify's   customers.One last metric to consider is gross merchandise volume and   what percentage of that volume is processed through Shopify   Payments. During the third quarter, GMV reached $3.8 billion and   Shopify Payments processed $1.5 billion, or 39%. Before that,   Shopify didn't provide exact details but noted on its   second-quarter report that ""the percentage of GMV processed   through Shopify Payments continues to grow,""Qualitative updates from managementIn addition to those key metrics, investors should watch for   management's commentary on its recent deal to integrate withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) marketplace, further strengthening Shopify's   partnership with the retail giant. The new deal makes it easier   for Shopify merchants to list their products on Amazon. Amazon   previously shut down its Amazon Webstore service and sent its   users to Shopify.Image source: ShopifyInvestors should also look for comments on the continued   growth of Shopify Plus, its enterprise-level e-commerce solution.   Any updates on the progress of Shopify Shipping and Shopify   Capital -- two high-margin products -- could be valuable as   well.Overall, Shopify looks set to produce yet another earnings   beat, but the stock is priced as though the market expects as   much. Anything short could hurt the stock price, but depending on   what caused the shortfall, some pullback in the stock could   present a long-term buying opportunity.10 stocks we like better than ShopifyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Nordstrom and Others Dump Trump: Here's Who Still Sells the Trump Brand;2/13/2017;"Ivanka Trump's fashion line has come under fire recently as the political turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump and his administration rages on. And now, some retailers have stopped carrying Ivanka Trump's brand.Over the last several weeks, corporate America has responded to President Trump's travel ban and other initiatives of the new Trump administration, in a variety of manners. The biggest display came when nearly 130 companies, including AppleAAPL, FacebookFBand MicrosoftMSFT, took to the courts to fight against the controversial travel ban from seven Muslim-majority nations.The Trump Brand BattleMacy'sMstopped selling Donald Trump's line of menswear in Summer 2015, after the then presidential candidate made inflammatory remarks regarding Mexican immigrants. NBC Universal, owned by ComcastCMCSAended its business relationship with Trump for the same reason when it opted to no longer air his Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.Donald Trump's critics have urged consumers to stop shopping at retailers that sell Trump family brands, including Ivanka Trump's line of women's clothing and accessories. At the same time, Trump supporters have threatened to stop shopping at businesses that cut ties with any Trump brands.On February 2, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from Trump's economic advisory board amid the travel ban fight. The move leaves Tesla'sTSLAElon Musk as the only remaining big-time tech executive still sitting on the board.The battle between corporate America, consumers, the Trump administration and Trump brands is likely just heating up.Grab Your Wallet CampaignShannon Coulter, a San Francisco-based political activist, began the hashtag #GrabYourWallet campaign on social media in November. Since then, the campaign has spawned into awebsitethat constantly updates its lists of companies that still carry or no longer carry Trump family brands and products.The website lists the ""Top Ten Companies We're Boycotting, Other Companies We're Boycotting and Companies NOT Being Boycotted At This Time.""NordstromJWNofficially announced on February 2 it will not buy Ivanka Trump's brand for the upcoming season. The company first came under pressure to cut ties with all thingsTrump in Oct. 2016. The company cited her brand's declining performance as the reason it would no longer be carried, not external political pressure.Nordstrom's stock went upafter the formal announcement.Neiman Marcus dropped Ivanka Trump's high-end jewelry line from its website nearly the same time Nordstrom made the move. Neiman representatives took a similar stance, citing the brand's recent poor performance.Belk, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based store no longer sells Ivanka Trump's brand online. The company cited performance metrics for making the change. But, the company still carries her brand in stores.WayfairW, which sells furniture and home décor, dropped Trump Home products in November. Fellow home design retailer Bellacor also dropped Trump Home.WalmartWMT-acquired e-commerce power Jet.com began to drop Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump-branded apparel and perfume,according to aMicreport.

But HSN stated the company did not have to cut ties with Ivanka Trump's brand, amid reports it had dropped her brand as well. HSN stated it has never sold any Ivanka Trump products.Sears HoldingsSHLDremoved 31 Trump Home items from online stores.But the company pushed back Mondayamid reports it had stopped carrying Trump brands.Company's Still Selling Trump BrandDespite the turmoil, many brands have not dropped the Trump brand. Macy's stopped selling Donald Trump's line of menswear, but it still sells Ivanka Trump's line.

Netflix is My Biggest Stock Holding -- and That Isn't Changing Any Time Soon;2/13/2017;"Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ: NFLX) is by far my largest holding. Not because it's the   one I invested the most in -- far from it. I only invested 1.5%   of my original invested funds in Netflix. It has since grown to   an astounding 20% of my portfolio thanks to 3,000% gains. Some   might argue that is too much to have riding on a single company   and would've sold off some of the position to lock-in those   gains.Not me. Even after the massive run the stock has gone on, I   see a business with several big growth opportunities that can   meaningfully move the needle.makeArticleAd();Netflix available across all your devices. Image source:     Netflix, Inc.Netflix was my first investment back in 2007, just as the   company was introducing its online streaming. I was one of the   disillusioned customers of Blockbuster -- now owned byDISH-- that found Netflix a couple of years earlier, when I was   charged $40 in late fees for a movie that I could have purchased   for $20. I cut up my Blockbuster card, joined Netflix and never   looked back. I saw then what I see now: a company that is   providing an unbeatable service at a reasonable price. I love the   programming, my personal dealings with its customer service have   been seamless, and these experiences as a consumer (plus some big   business levers) have made me a more confident investor.Ready to take on the worldIn addition to providing a great customer experience, Netflix   has a large un-tapped pool of potential customers. Its total   addressable market, based on fixed-line broadband subscribers is   estimated at 765 million homes worldwide. This number is   expected to grow to 925 million by 2020. Even excluding an   estimated 300 million potential customers in China, a country   Netflix itself admits would be difficult to enter, the company's   addressable market could exceed 625 million potential customers   within three years.Netflix available in 200 countries -and in Portuguese! Image     source: Netflix, Inc.Within its US market, the number of households is estimated at   125 million, of which Netflix counts 49 million subscribers, for   a penetration rate of about 40%. If it were to achieve that level   of penetration in the rest of the world -- even excluding China   -- paid subscribers could grow more than 2.5 times from its   current level of 94 million to 240 million worldwide. This   excludes potential market increases from population gains and   further broadband penetration.Economies of scale at playLet's not forget decreasing incremental costs, which is the   cost of adding each additional subscriber. Once Netflix has built   out its library of streaming content, a greater portion of the   revenue from each additional subscriber will drop to the bottom   line. Netflix has been hard at work growing its portfolio of   self-produced original programs. It plans to spend $6 billion in   2017 up from $5 billion in 2016. In its most recent shareholder   letter, it stated ""it is clear to us that high quality content   travels well across borders."" The ability to spread the cost of   its content across an ever-growing base of global customers   produces economies of scale not available to traditional linear   TV broadcasters.Amazing original contentNetflix plans to have its self-produced originals eventually   account for half of the platform's content. At Goldman Sachs 25th   Annual Communacopia Conference on September 20, 2016 CFO David   Wells indicated that the company was still a couple of years away   from that goal, estimating that it is one-third to halfway there.   Netflix first began debuting exclusive original content in 2013   as a way to differentiate its offerings. Many of those shows have   become wildly popular. New seasons of some of its earliest   releases are still enthralling viewers includingHouse of CardsandOrange is the New Black. It's partnership's withThe Walt Disney Company's(NYSE: DIS) Marvel has produced such hits asDaredevil,Jessica Jones,The Punisher,andLuke Cage-- my personal favorites. Other offerings includingStranger ThingsandMaking A Murdererhave become cultural phenomenons. The caliber of these offerings   has put the industry on notice that Netflix is a force to be   reckoned with and bolstered the strength of the platform.Netflix has plans for half its library to be self-produced     original content. Image source: Netflix, Inc.It could still all go sidewaysWhat could go wrong? Plenty. Cash burn could overwhelm the   video purveyor. Even by its own estimates, it will produce   negative cash flow of $2 billion in 2017, up from $1.7 billion in   2016. Additionally, competition is heating up in the space.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) announced in December that it had expanded its   competing streaming service to 200 countries. The e-commerce   giant is one of the few companies with the resources to compete   with Netflix on a global level. Finally, worldwide growth   estimates may be too aggressive. Netflix virtuous cycle only   works as it continues to add new members. If that growth stalls   before the build-out is complete, it could come crashing   down.My money is where my mouth isEven in the face of those potential challenges, my money is   still on Netflix. I think Netflix has executed its plan nearly   flawlessly, itsQwikster debaclenotwithstanding. The worldwide expansion is on track and the   company very rarely misses its own internal financial and   subscriber growth estimates. That, plus the success of its   original content, proves to me that Netflix is company that is   connected to its customers.So long as the results keep proving that, I don't plan on   selling any time soon.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Can Always Brush Things Off;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI won't sit here and tell you that I have any idea what a reasonable valuation forAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) should be. I mean, I have SOME idea, but seeing how nobody else really has any idea, I may as well throw darts. AMZN stock tends to move in big chunks based on big news, such as an earnings report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEven though Amazon stock missed estimates when it reported last week, and the stock got whacked, I say it means nothing because there is no hard-and-fast way to value AMZN stock. Without that centralized, normalized metric as a baseline, it is difficult to interpret what the earnings report actually means except in a general sense.Nevertheless, I'll try.First, the market got tied in knots over Amazon missing revenue estimates. Revenue was $43.74 billion, which fell short of the $44.68 billion total. Gasp. Web Services revenue fell $64 million short, coming in at $3.536 billion. Double gasp. Q1 guidance was for $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion, short of $35.95 billion expected.The sky is falling.Why AMZN Stock Isn't Really in Any TroubleOf course, nobody mentioned that AMZN actually turned in a $749 million profit, up 55% from the previous year. Web Services had operating income of $926 million compared to $580 million last year and that accounted for almost three-fourths of Amazon's total operating income. Mind you, the loss in its international e-commerce unit blew up to $487 million from a loss of $108 million the year before.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenSee, AMZN stock really is different from any other stock because it is basically taking huge chunks of cash and free cash flow and investing in a very-long-term infrastructure and services plan.Amazon is constantly investing in and beefing up its Prime service, which various sources put at 65 million subscribers (Bezos won't say). This doesn't mean just the techy stuff like Price Reading, Audible Channels and Twitch, but the hub of Prime: free 2-day delivery.That's where the rub is from an expense standpoint. AMZN stock added 18 more cities to Prime service, which means more infrastructure to support those cities, like warehouses and labor and transport. The company needs fulfillment centers. That's why it's building a $1.5 billion new airport hub in Cincinnati.Then we can add in the investments in Amazon Fresh, which also requires tons of infrastructure to support, and its expansion into India.Spend, spend, spend in order to grow, grow, grow.What's so bizarre and different is that most companies would - after more than 20 years in business - have predictable earnings and growth. Except Amazon is trying to take over the world, and Bezos isn't worried about profit because he has tons of cash flow. This is very John Malone of him, and we know how successful Malone has been, even as predicting earnings-per-share for any of his zillion tracking stocks is equally impossible.Thus, a revenue miss means nothing to me. We're in the top of the third inning.Bottom Line on Amazon StockStill, can we value Amazon stock at all? Well, yes … sort of.Take Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA ratio: AMZN stock trades at about 30.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) trades at 24.Wal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) trades at 7.7.Liberty Interactive Corp(NASDAQ:QVCA, NASDAQ:QVCB) trades at 8.4. So on this basis, AMZN stock is crazy expensive.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkOn a price-to-sales basis, Amazon stock trades at 2.9. The other stocks above trade at 14, 0.43 and 0.88, respectively. So AMZN stock is arguably expensive by this metric as well.How about return on equity? This is the amount of net income that is returned as a percentage of shareholder equity. Amazon is at 14.52%. For FB, WMT, and QVCA, return on equity is 19.76%, 18.46% and 11.67%. In this case, AMZN falls in the middle.Ultimately, that's why I prefer to sell naked puts on Amazon stock that are far out of the money and expire months down the line. I make a little money with much less risk.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman’s $150 Target;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs it too late to bite into shares ofApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), which last week hit a new 52-week high? That has been the question rolling around investors' minds amid a 10% run for AAPL stock over the past month, and a 22% gain over the past quarter.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockIt's increasingly difficult to find a nice entry point in Apple stock, and that's truer today, with shares set to rise again on a price-target upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski just raised the firm's PT on AAPL stock from $133 to $150, implying another 14% or so in upside from here. Her comments:""Last week's industry datapoints (e.g. from optical supplier Lumentum) suggest that the inclusion of 3D sensing functionality is increasingly likely, which could enable a robust augmented reality [AR] feature set that we believe will be a key differentiator for the 10-year anniversary iPhone. This is a significant step-up in innovation vs. the prior two product cycle, especially when viewed in conjunction with the potential significant form factor change enabled by the move to an OLED display (e.g. removal of the bezels and the home button).""Apple shares finished Friday at $132.13 - a 2.4% gain for the week. And $150 seems like an easy target for the stock to reach.Why AAPL Stock Can Hit $150A combination of factors are driving the increase. Notably, the market now seems less pessimistic about the adverse impact Donald Trump's presidency might have on tech companies, including other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB).7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveIn the case of Apple, though, aside from the company's strong first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings last month, AAPL stock is also driven by speculation that the company's next product cycle might be ahead of schedule.And not only are there rumors that Apple may release its iPhone 8 earlier than its normal September launch date, the iPhone 8 - the device's anniversary edition - may be priced ""north of $1,000"" and could be called the ""iPhone X,"" according toFast Company.What's more, the design of iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) - which Fast Company said will ""look something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its design"" - is expected to encompass a drastic departure from what consumers have become accustomed to. The physical buttons on the phone's sides are likely gone and will be replaced with metal inlays.Apple is rumored to relocate the home button, putting it under the display. And the new device, which may finally support wireless charging, might not have the rounded edges its predecessors have had. These enhancements were reported by MacRumors, which cited a note from KCI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said Apple's iPhone 8 will have a new 3D Touch module.These potential catalysts have forced Wall Street to adjust their models, prompting several bullish calls from the likes of Bank of America, which also recently raised its price target on AAPL stock to $145 from $140.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Has Become a Short TargetMichael Walkley, Canaccord Genuity analyst, lifted his price target to $154 from $142, saying, ""we believe Apple will extend its leading market share of the premium-tier smartphone market installed base during 2017.""Bottom Line for AAPL StockIf Apple was able to sell a more than 78 million phones in 2016's holiday quarter, just imagine what it could do in this year's holiday quarter given the feature-rich qualities the new iPhone 8 (or whatever it will be called) will have.As such, $150 to $155 now seems like a realistic target for AAPL stock by the end of the year, representing a 14% to 18% move.Combined with Apple's 1.7% yield, that's excellent value.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceQualcomm, Inc.

Consumers' 5 Most Beloved Companies;2/13/2017;"makeArticleAd();Market-research agency MBLM has released its 2017Brand Intimacy Report, seeking to understand the part that emotion plays in successful   companies. The report reveals that the top brands ""are exemplars   in building emotional bonds and deep connections with their   customers and creating stronger attachment and engagement.""This deeper relationship leads to stronger financial   performance, as these companies enjoy higher revenue and earnings   than their peers; the study reveals that the stock prices of the   top companies significantly outperformed theS&P 500. It also provides insights into specific demographics such asmillennialsorbaby boomers. Break out the hearts and flowers, as we look at the companies   that have the greatest emotional attachment for consumers.NFLX, HOG, AMZN, DIS, AAPL, SPY Price Percentage Change data   byYCharts.Netflix is most-loved among the 18-34 year demographic.     Image source: Netflix.5. Netflix, Inc.The report found that escapist brands performed well over the   past year. With nearly 50 million U.S. subscribers,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) may provide one of the most popular forms of   escape. Our ubiquitous streaming provider had the highest   percentage of ""bonding"" customers -- those that express   acceptance and trust of the company. It jumped from 25th place to   5th place in the last year, yet was only listed as an intimate   brand by those aged 18-34. This represents a huge future   opportunity, as Netflix is revered by a significant percentage of   the youngest portion of the population. The phrase ""Netflix and   chill"" entering the popular lexicon is an indication of the reach   of this company into pop culture, and the loving feelings of   customers for one of our favorite purveyors of entertainment.A favorite brand among 45- to 64-year olds. Image source:     Pixabay.4. Harley-Davidson, Inc.TheHarley-Davidson(NYSE: HOG) brand is iconic and steeped in Americana. This   company provides distraction of another variety. The report notes   that ""Harley-Davidson offers escape on the road, freedom and   solitary time."" Harley was only listed as an intimate brand by   those aged 45 to 64. It has a higher price point than some   competitors, and distinctive designs give the brand an image of   exclusivity, resulting in an extremely fervent following among a   small percentage of the population. It should be noted that this   company is the exception among consumer favorites, having   underperformed the S&P 500 over the three-, five-, and   10-year periods. We still love you, bro.Amazon is loved across all demographics! Image source:     Amazon.com.3. Amazon.com, Inc.The largest e-commerce company in the world,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN)  was one of two brands that were the most   successful in eliciting emotion across all ages and income   brackets. It also offers escapism similar to Netflix via its   Prime Video streaming service. Analysts estimate that Amazon has   Prime members in more than half the households in the   U.S. With its ability to provide all things to all people,   Amazon can often be found gracing the lists of companies with the   best customer service, as well. This alone may account for a   great many of customers' expressions of amour for this   company.The Happiest Place on Earth. Image source: Author.2. The Walt Disney CompanyDisney(NYSE: DIS) ranked highest for nostalgia -- as the report says,   ""memories of the past and the warm, poignant feelings associated   with them."" The House of Mouse has been providing entertainment   and escape for generations of fans since it first releasedSnow White and the Seven Dwarfsback in 1937. It has also continued to grow with fans, adding   such favorites as theStar Warsand Marvel Studios movies in recent years. This shows, as it   ranked No. 1 among millennials and No. 3 among those aged 35 to   44. With a strong showing among the youngest consumers, this   translates to opportunities for relationships with the next   generation of fans.Apple is the most beloved brand. Image source: Apple,     Inc.1. Apple, Inc.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the most beloved brand in the survey. With its   cultlike following and consistent marks for quality and user   appeal, it most successfully crossed age, gender, and income   boundaries. Apple scored highest in a variety of measures in the   report, including enhancement (becoming better through use of the   brand), ritual (ingraining the brand in daily activity), and   identity (reflecting an aspirational image). It ranked highest in   the fusing category, in which the identities of the customer and   the brand are ""inexorably linked."" It also ranked highest under   ""can't live without it"" and ""frequency of use."" According to the   report, ""Electronics are the things that surround you and involve   you with the world,"" and nobody does electronics better than   Apple. It brings ""connected"" to a whole new level.Investor takeawayAccording to Mario Natarelli, MLBM's managing partner: ""The   underpinning of intimacy is the closer you get to your customer,   the better. That's not a new idea."" As each of the companies on   this list demonstrates, there are a multitude of ways to reach   your customers on an emotional level. Be it by escaping,   connecting, or nostalgia, it isn't so much how you establish that   relationship, it's that you do.

The Simple Concept Underlying U.S. Bancorp's Dominance;2/13/2017;"Even if you compareU.S. Bancorp(NYSE: USB) to the best in the banking business, it still   dominates the competition. For seven consecutive years, it has   ranked first among big banks in terms of return on equity, the   preeminent profitability metric in the industry.I've studied U.S. Bancorp over the years in an effort to   figure out how it does this -- especially how it does so year in   and year out. The short answer is that the Minneapolis-based bank   is highly efficient, spending a smaller share of its revenue on   operating expenses each year than even the notoriously efficientWells Fargo.Data source: Quarterly earnings reports. Chart by     author.makeArticleAd();But there's more to U.S. Bancorp's perennial outperformance   than just this. Efficiency is a necessary but not sufficient   condition of dominance in the bank industry. A bank must be   efficient to outperform its peers, in other words, but efficiency   alone doesn't capture the whole picture. It instead merely   ignites and accelerates what may best be described of as a force   of nature, akin to the law of compounding returns.Jim Collins in his bookGood to Greatanalogizes this force of nature to a flywheel. It takes effort to   get the wheel spinning, and more effort to make it go faster, but   at a certain point, Collins notes, there's a breakthrough when   the laws of physics take over:The momentum of the thing kicks in in your favor, hurling     the flywheel forward, turn after turn . . . whoosh! . . . its     own heavy weight working for you. You're pushing no harder than     during the first rotation, but the flywheel goes faster and     faster. Each turn of the flywheel builds upon the work done     earlier, compounding your investment of effort. A thousand     times faster, then ten thousand, than a hundred thousand. The     huge heavy disk flies forward, with almost unstoppable     momentum.No company illustrates the power of this concept better thanAmazon.com, which, as Brad Stone writes inThe Everything Store, incorporated Collins' flywheel into its operating philosophy   more than a decade and a half ago.In Amazon's version, a low-cost structure enables the   e-commerce giant to offer lower prices than its competitors.   Lower prices lead to happier customers, which leads to higher   traffic on its website. Higher traffic encourages new sellers to   join Amazon's marketplace, which increases selection. And a   better selection improves the customer experience, which powers a   new revolution of the flywheel.The Virtuous Cycle, as drawn by Amazon. Image source:     Amazon.Although Amazon and U.S. Bancorp are very different companies,   the flywheel concept works in a similar way for the $446 billion   bank. In fact, given the unique dynamics of banking, it may be an   even more powerful force in the financial services arena.By operating more efficiently than its peers, U.S. Bancorp can   underprice them in the credit space. This attracts high-quality   borrowers, boosting loan volumes and reducing loan losses. The   latter keeps a lid on credit costs and thereby enables U.S.   Bancorp to be even more competitive with respect to loan terms on   the next revolution of the flywheel. It also buttresses the   bank's debt rating, which keeps its interest expenses low and   thus acts as added accelerant. Holding all else equal, then, with   each turn of the flywheel, U.S. Bancorp should widen its   competitive advantage over its peers.This chain of events isn't just theoretical. Here's U.S.   Bancorp Chairman and CEO Richard Davis connecting the dots   between its low-cost debt and heightened pricing power on a   conference call with analysts in 2015:[Our best in class debt ratings] allow us to benefit from     pricing. And again, this is an audience that understands this,     but if we're going to the markets and we can receive five-year     money at a 40 to 60 basis point benefit from our peer group,     that's five years we get to price things better by 40% to 60%     -- basis points and/or at least take half of it and put it into     price. We only deal with high-quality customers, so we're not     using it for subprime or near-prime purposes. We're using it     for the best customers to win them and keep them, but we're     unabashed about saying that we'll use pricing as a tool at this     moment in time.As I've demonstratedin the past, moreover, there's a clear correlation between efficiency ratios   and loan losses among the nation's biggest banks. This follows   from the fact that less efficient banks must stretch for yield in   their loan portfolios in order to generate the double-digit   returns on equity earned by more efficient banks. And because   higher yields reflect higher risk, less efficient banks tend to   write off a larger share of their loan portfolios during   recessions such as the one following the financial crisis eight   years ago.Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Chart by       author.The irregular but not infrequent undulations of the credit   cycle further accelerate this, as banks that play fast and loose   with credit risk are more likely to fail when the economy takes a   turn for the worse. And even short of insolvency, a bank that   takes large loan losses in a downturn is in no position to pick   up its less prudent peers for pennies on the dollar when they run   into trouble, which is one of the most effective ways to grow a   bank and maximize returns over the long run.What all of this means is that U.S. Bancorp should continue to   outperform its peers in the years ahead. Its stock isn't cheap,   and Davis is retiring later this year, but I don't believe that   either of these alter the investment thesis underlying its stock.10 stocks we like better than US BancorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Google's Biggest Cloud Customer Just Signed a $1 Billion Deal With Amazon;2/12/2017;"It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to   split its allegiances. Just a week afterSnap(NYSE: SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract   with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion   contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat   functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for ""redundant   infrastructure support of our business operations,"" according to   Snap'samended S-1filing.The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for   nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the   way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be   spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on   Google Cloud.makeArticleAd();It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts.     Image Source: Snap.A quick look at Snap's cloud contractsYearAmazon spendingGoogle spending2017$50 million$400 million*2018$125 million$400 million*2019$200 million$400 million*2020$275 million$400 million*2021$350 million$400 millionSource: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of   the amount to the subsequent year.Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That   might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy   for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant   downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for   Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations.Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built   Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud   provider ""would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to   incur significant time and expense,"" it said in its S-1. What's   more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,""   some of which do not have an alternative in the market,""   according to its prospectus.But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't   operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider,   anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending,   Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on   Google to help facilitate a transition.Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to   Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made   it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to   steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much   for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year   -- but it means a whole lot to Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the   next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405   million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as   Snap.At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out   its own infrastructure like other popular internet services.   Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's   built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties   to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for   the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way   anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross   margin.Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of   its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure   expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap   posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that   primarily produces software.By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud   services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing   customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and   Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Wal-Mart Can Take On Amazon Beyond Free 2-Day Shipping;2/12/2017;"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) has taken another step forward in its quest to challengeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) for e-commerce supremacy.The world's largest retailer ditched its Amazon Prime-wannabe, Shipping Pass, which offered free three-day shipping for an annual fee of $49, and is instead offering free two-day shipping on all orders of $35 or more.makeArticleAd();It's a better deal for customers, as a majority of orders on the company's website are for more than $35, and Wal-Mart's success has historically come from offering rock-bottom prices without hurdles such as a membership fee, offering a different kind of value from Amazon Prime. Wal-Mart's own warehouse chain, Sam's Club, has always lagged behindCostco Wholesale.Image source: Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart is making more than 2 million items eligible for free two-day shipping, but that's much less than Amazon, which has over 50 million items available for free two-day shipping to Prime members. Wal-Mart's $35 minimum, however, is lower than Amazon's $50 minimum for non-Prime members, which does not promise two-day delivery -- though deliveries now often come in two days anyway, as the company's distribution network has vastly expanded in recent years.Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce CEO, Marc Lore, who came to the company with the Jet.com acquisition last year, touted the move, saying in a press release: ""I couldn't be more excited. We are moving at the speed of a start-up. Two-day free shipping is the first of many moves we will be making to enhance the customer experience and accelerate growth."" With a nod to Amazon, Lore added, ""In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes. It no longer makes sense to charge for it.""Will it be enough?Wal-Mart's free two-day shipping offer is certainly a step in the right direction, as was its acquisition last summer of Jet.com, the company Lore founded. But there's also evidence that Amazon is stretching its lead over the retail giant.Amazon's North American e-commerce sales jumped 22% in the fourth quarter, reaching $80 billion for the full year, and the company grabbed 53% of all e-commerce sales growth in the country last year, according to Slice Intelligence.That figure shows how dominant Amazon has become, taking more than half of new e-commerce sales in the country, which added $16 billion to its revenue last year. Retail giants like Wal-Mart and its competitors, as well as smaller e-commerce providers, are left to fight over the remaining growth.Amazon continues to tighten the screws on its rivals, adding more members to Prime, and spreading Prime Now and Fresh to new cities.According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon now has 65 million Prime members, or slightly more than half of total U.S. households. Wal-Mart's new two-day free shipping offer is unlikely to appeal to current Prime members, who have already coughed up the $99 annual fee to get free shipping and benefits including video streaming and access to the Kindle Lending Library.But Wal-Mart can start by making a bid for non-Prime shoppers, who may currently be even more profitable to Amazon -- the company is running a wide shipping deficit, with net shipping costs totaling $7.2 billion last year. Shipping costs are growing faster than shipping revenue, evidence that membership fees from Prime are not keeping up with shipping costs.Price vs. convenienceWal-Mart can start by pressing its price advantage over Amazon. After all, the world's largest retailer reached the top of the food chain by promising everyday low prices that drove the mom-and-pop stores that couldn't compete out of business. Amazon stole some of that thunder as it also focused on rock-bottom prices during its early days, but the company has increasingly pivoted to competing on convenience over price, as its Prime membership program has come to dominate its domestic operations.Amazon still retains a reputation as a low-cost provider, however, because it tends to discount the most popular items, but charge full price on less popular ones. In fact, the common perception that Amazon is less expensive than Wal-Mart is incorrect.Wal-Mart needs to undo this perception through savvy marketing and aggressive pricing. Since it's significantly more profitable than Amazon, both in dollars and margin, it has the ability to slash prices even further to regain its reputation as the price leader. In fiscal 2016, Wal-Mart U.S.'s operating margin was 6.4%, compared to 3% last year for Amazon's North American e-commerce division.From there, Wal-Mart needs to further leverage its Jet.com acquisition, making its ""smart basket"" technology -- an algorithm that lowers prices based on things the customer can control, like the number of items in their order -- available for all of its customers. I'd expect an announcement on that later this year, and many more such advances in the first full year of the Wal-Mart/Jet partnership. Lore has proven his e-commerce start-up mettle twice before, and hinted at further advances.Still, Amazon continues to move at light-speed, opening up new fulfillment centers and unveiling innovations like the cashier-less Amazon Go store. Catching Amazon won't be easy, but Wal-Mart still has several advantages. With Lore's help, the company should be able to unlock them.10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon's Shipping Costs Are Soaring. Should Investors Be Worried?;2/12/2017;"E-commerce was supposed to be cheaper than operating a retail   store, the traditional thinking went. Online sellers can save   money by avoiding pricey commercial rents and a staff devoted to   assisting customers.Despite the conventional wisdom, that hasn't always been the   case, and shipping costs are a primary reason why.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) spends billions more on shipping than it brings in   in charges and fees, and many brick-and-mortar retailers have   complained that e-commerce sales, though accretive to overall   revenue, come with a lower margin than in-store sales. With   networks of stores across the country, incremental sales in   stores cost those retailers almost nothing in operating costs,   but each e-commerce sale needs to be picked, packed, and   shipped.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty ImagesFor Amazon, shipping costs have long been a concern for the   company. In recent years, Amazon has made efforts to diversify   its logistics capabilities, entering into a contract to lease 20   cargo planes last year, recently handling its own ocean freight,   and also building a $1.5 billion airport hub in Cincinnati. The   company sees those investments as necessary to handle spikes in   demands that can overwhelm its shipping partners likeFedEx,UPS, and the US Postal Service, especially after thousands after   deliveries arrived late for Christmas in 2013. As its retail   sales grow by more than 20% a year, it seems logical that the   company will have to take more of its logistics under its   control.However, as Amazon's sales have skyrocketed so too have its   shipping costs. Those expenses reached $16.2 billion last year, a   40% increase from the year before and accounted for nearly all of   the company's $17.6 billion in fulfillment expenses, its biggest   line item after cost of sales, or what Amazon pays for the goods   it sells. During the same time, net shipping costs, which   subtract revenue from shipping fees along with a portion of Prime   membership fees, surged 43% to $7.2 billion, outpacing overall   e-commerce sales growth of 24.9% last year. That was the fastest   growth in net shipping costs since 2011.Let's take a closer at Amazon's shipping costs to see what   investors can expect in the coming years.Shipping ain't easyAmazon has stepped up efforts to make shipping even faster and   more convenient for its customers. It now offers its Prime Now   service with delivery in as short as an hour in 40 cities   worldwide, and has more than 60 million Prime members in the U.S.   according to some estimates.And the recent expenditures are evident based on the explosion   in shipping costs last year.Source: Amazon 10-K Filings. Note: 2011 and 2012 revenue growth   figures include AWS.As the charts above show ,shipping costs have grown   substantially in recent years as net shipping costs jumped more   than fivefold from 2010-2016 to $7.2 billion. However, the second   chart shows that e-commerce sales growth mostly kept pace with   net shipping costs between 2012 and 2015, and even last year's   spike in net shipping costs came with an acceleration in   e-commerce growth, a sign that the increase in shipping costs was   the result of increased demand and not poor management.The charts below may offer a clearer picture of how shipping   costs are affecting Amazon's bottom line.Source: Amazon FilingsSource: Amazon Filings.Note: Figures do not include expense for stock-based   compensation. 2010-2012 figures include AWS.As the charts above show, shipping costs as a percentage of   revenue have been relatively steady in recent years, although   there was an uptick last year. The second chart also shows that   operating income has surged in the last two years despite rising   shipping costs. That seems to indicate that Amazon is executing   its business objectives effectively -- and that rising shipping   costs are one consequence of that growth, even if they have not   been substantial enough to derail its overall profit growth.For investors, the lesson is clear. While net shipping costs   demand some attention, especially as they are set to top $10   billion this year, they are only one part of the larger business   story here. Amazon, after all, is not a shipping company but an   e-commerce business, and absorbing shipping costs is a necessary   component of growing its business as it meets surging demand.As the recent profit growth shows, there's no need for   investors to worry about rising shipping costs for the time   being, and as long as e-commerce profits are growing, rising   shipping costs should be seen as simply a necessary function of   that profit growth.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Why Amazon.com Inc. Is Investing Billions in India;2/11/2017;"India is the world's second most populous country, its biggest   democracy, and its sixth-biggest economy. And now, it appears to   be the next big prize forAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .When Amazon spots a market opportunity, it goes all in after   it. In the past, the company has jumped on nascent markets in   e-commerce, e-books, video streaming, and cloud computing. Its   ability to recognize opportunities and take advantage of them is   one of the biggest drivers of its success.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Now, on a global scale, India may be the company's next big   opportunity. Amazon announced it would invest an additional $3   billion on the subcontinent last year, and CEO Jeff Bezos has   ordered his deputies to ""do what it takes"" to win the Indian   market, where the company faces stiff competition from China'sAlibabaand native players Snapdeal and FlipKart.What makes India so specialIndia presents a unique e-commerce opportunity for several   reasons. The country currently has 1.3 billion people, about four   times the population of the U.S., and is on track to surpass   China as the world's most populous country in just five years,   according to the U.N.Its economy is growing 5% annually. Much of the population is   tech-savvy, with smartphone penetration reaching more than 30%,   making it the world's second-biggest smartphone market after   China. About 10% of Indians speak English, giving it the   second-largest English-speaking population after the U.S., and   thus making it an ideal market for Amazon Video, which the   company launched internationally at the end of 2016. Finally,   India is densely populated, with 1,033 people per square mile,   compared to the U.S., which has just 85 people per square, and   its retail industry is highly fragmented, without dominant   entrenched brands occupying positions similar to whatWal-Mart, for example, holds in the U.S.Those two factors make the country an ideal market for an   e-commerce operator like Amazon. The high population density   means shipping would be much easier and cheaper than in the U.S.,   especially if the company can master drone delivery, and the   highly fragmented nature of the retail sector makes the benefits   of e-commerce even more desirable and the competition weaker.What is the company doing?In 2014, Amazon announced a $2 billion investment in India and   followed that with another $3 billion last year for a total of $5   billion. Due to Indian regulations, Amazon operates only a   marketplace in India, selling goods through third-party vendors,   but it handles the technology infrastructure and most of its   vendors' deliveries. Building out its own delivery network, as   opposed to relying onUPSor the Postal Service as it does domestically, is costly. Amazon   also seems to have learned lessons from China, where it failed to   adapt significantly to the local market and fell well behind the   competition.The company stepped up its efforts on the subcontinent in   December when it launched its video streaming service as part of   Prime, for an annual fee of just $15. Amazon is offering a   one-year trial for half that price, just $7.50, a notable   contrast withNetflix, which launched its service globally at roughly the same   $10-a-month price tag the company charges in the U.S., as it says   it's targeting elites rather than offering a mass-market product.   Amazon, as usual, is content to grab market share now and worry   about profits later.Playing the long gameAmazon isn't the only one paying attention to the Indian   market, of course.Applehas also noticed a big opportunity, and it's increasingly   touting its growth in India on its earnings calls -- smartphone   shipments grew 18% in the country in 2016, and it sold 2.5   million iPhones there.Amazon has always been willing to play the long game,   investing for the long term is one of Bezos' core mantras, and he   promised his first shareholders as much. The Indian e-commerce   market is still small, but it's growing fast: Sales more than   doubled from $6.3 billion in 2014 to $16 billion in 2015. If   Amazon can repeat its performance in the U.S., where it controls   about one quarter of e-commerce sales, its Indian operations   could be huge in just a few years.The company does not break out results by country, but its   investments abroad are apparent from its financial statements.   While operating income spiked in North America and in Amazon Web   Services last year, its international operating loss widened from   $699 million to $1.28 billion, evidence of investments like those   it is making in India.Though it will be several years at least until Amazon   generates a profit in the region, the company is making the right   move by investing heavily in the subcontinent. Its size and   growth make it a unique opportunity for the company, and Amazon   has shown time and again that it recognizes the wisdom of   breaking into an emerging market early.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

With Netflix-Sized Dreams, Facebook Hires MTV Executive to Create Original Content;2/10/2017;"Earlier this week, it was discovered that social media giantFacebookFBhas hired-or, really,poached-an executive from MTV to help create original video content.Mina Lefevre, a former MTV executive vice president, will join Facebook as its new head of development. She naturally made the announcement on herFacebook page, saying ""I have always been drawn to the idea of building something and the idea of being part of the team that helps build Facebook's original content ecosystem...well, that just seems like a dream!""At MTV, which is a subsidiary of ViacomVIA, Lefevre was the head of scripted programming, and working on hit shows likeFaking It,Awkward,Finding Carter,Scream,Teen Wolf,Nicole Byer,Mary + Jane,Sweet/Vicious, andThe Shannara Chronicles. At Facebook, she'll be overseeing the development of the site's scripted and unscripted content, as well as working with global creative strategy head Ricky Van Veen, who joined the company last year. Van Veen is also the co-founder of CollegeHumor.It's well-known that Facebook is dedicated to making video a central part of how users experience its site, whether on mobile or desktop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even said during the company'slast earnings callthat Facebook is beginning to experiment with shorter, episodic videos to push into its News Feed. And, its Facebook Live feature has been a huge success for the company, especially after this past election year.And because of its success, Facebook has had to figure out ways to monetize this new source of revenue. Ms. Lefevre's hiring is both a way for the company to capitalize on this content, as well as keep its users engaged with the site. Creating original content that could compete with the likes of NetflixNFLX, Amazon'sAMZNPrime, and Google'sGOOGLYouTube would allow Facebook to sell ads in a whole new, uncharted area for the tech giant.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack when I was a kid, a half-century ago, most people saw only three TV networks - CBS, NBC and ABC.makeArticleAd();Source:Flash.pro via Flickr (modified)If you're old enough to remember the DuMont network, please check outmy recent gallery on dividend stocksthat provide solid retirement income. If you think ofTwenty-First Century Fox Inc(NASDAQ:FOXA) as the fourth network, read on.A quarter-century ago, when my children were small, a host of cable networks rose to challenge the broadcast networks for viewers. It was the age of""57 channels and nothing on""with ESPN, the USA Network, CNN, the Weather Channel and the Food Network all having their heyday.Over time, the broadcasters bought out most of the new operators, sometimes after being bought themselves.CBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) now owns Showtime and the Smithsonian Network.Comcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA), the parent of NBC, owns all or part of a dozen networks, including CNBC, Syfy and USA.Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), the parent of ABC, owns ESPN, the biggest franchise of all, and the Disney networks. And Fox, which grew up in this era, has clones for nearly all of them.But in the 2010s, a new force has arisen to challenge the network owners, a force they will find difficult to compete with and almost impossible to buy.That force is streaming services, which deliver their shows to your TV, over the internet through plug-in dongles rather than set-top boxes - unless you prefer viewing on a PC, tablet or phone. These offer all the entertainment a TV zombie might ever need, and the services can cost less than $10 per month, much less than a cable service. They don't have schedules, so you watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it.Streaming through the internet is the future of TV, and we are just at its dawn. It's still unclear how we will discover shows, how we will interface with what we want to watch or how much we'll eventually pay for the privilege of watching. But cable, at least as we knew it, is drifting away, as broadcast television previously drifted away. It will continue to exist, as broadcasting does, just in a smaller, truncated form.What is the future of live events in the new world? Is TV even going to remain a one-way, passive medium? We don't know.In addition to being better, and cheaper, for viewers, the new TV environment right now looks great for entertainers and show producers, who suddenly have a host of new options on where and how to sell their wares, which they're using to gain new creative freedom if not new wealth.But the new media landscape is a lot less stable than the old one and, given the wealth of choices available, it may prove much less lucrative for stars, writers and producers.Just a few years into the new era, moreover, it's apparent that the new streaming companies are big enough to regard the cable networks' owners as minnows. This is not a problem the networks can buy their way out of, as they bought out of cable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowYour mission, as an investor, is to examine the new TV stocks and decide whether to invest your money in them. And along the way, you will be buying a lot more than TV.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixThe business model of the new TV era was created byNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).A decade ago, Netflix was a relatively small but interesting company that mailed DVDs. You paid a monthly fee to hold a few, then got more when you sent them back. It was a relatively simple business based on physical media, but it had potential.By simply moving that business model online,using cloud services and open-source technology, Netflix now delivers unlimited amounts of content to viewers as a stream, rather than on a disk.Cofounder Reed Hastings has transformed TV as no one has since Ted Turner. If you bought Netflix when it went public in 2002, your $1 investment is now worth $137.Hasting's second big innovation, which came on the heels of the streaming business model, was tostart funding his own programmingrather than just reselling existing movies and TV shows. His string of hits began withHouse of Cards, based on a British mini-series, which by itself made his monthly $8 per month subscription fee seem a bargain.Netflix offers its shareholders low profit margins, but great growth. Between 2013 and 2016, revenue doubled, from $4.37 billion to $8.83 billion, and profits nearly followed, from 26 cents per share to 43 cents. Along the way, the company has increased its debt dramatically - it now represents about one-fourth of assets - to pay for its delivery infrastructure and to obtain new programming assets, which it is assumed will retain their value over time. (Your grandkids will watchHouse of Cardsthe way your kids now watchM*A*S*H.)With a market cap of $62 billion, Netflix could now buy other TV stocks, like CBS. Its value exceeds that of Fox. ABC and NBC are protected from a Netflix acquisition by deep-pocketed parents, Disney and Comcast. HBO, a subscription service based on cable, will be protected in the same way once parentTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) is bought byAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T).NFLX retains its value as an investment because ofits international operations, which by the fourth quarter of 2016 represented around 40% of the total and continue to grow. In the last three months of 2016 alone the company added 7.05 million new members, after forecasting it would add just 5.2 million. Netflix' growth is accelerating, and its ability to buy must-see programming is growing with it.The problem for Netflix is that the cloud providers on which its success rests have seen what it has done. They're on to the trick. A network today isn't necessarily just a provider of content, but the scaled infrastructure necessary to provide that content. The owners of cloud networks and vast internet networks are copying what Netflix does.These challengers have more zeroes in their asset bases than those NFLX has faced before. Once more, Reed Hastings is a minnow in a sea of sharks.Everything about the industry has changed, but whether Netflix can ride the changes, or whether it will eventually be bought out as Turner was, remains up for debate.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockThereisa price cheaper than Netflix' $8 per month for all-you-can-eat entertainment - the nothing extra I payAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to access its video as a Prime member.It is true that you can buy Amazon Prime Video, separately,for $8.99 per month. But that's silly since the regular price for Prime, which includes free two-day shipping on most Amazon items, is $99 per year (about $8.25 per month).Lately, Amazon has also been outperforming Netflix on the awards front. In addition to11 Golden Globe nominations this year alone, there are six Oscar nominations forManchester by the Sea(Amazonpaid $10 million for the distribution rightsa year ago).Frankly there is so much free stuff on Amazon (which I can watch on a big screen with my Fire Stick, a wireless dongle that fits on the side of the TV, connects to the internet via WiFi, and supports a host of other services including Netflix) that I don't need anything else. Were it not for live sports, I would kill my cable in a heartbeat, and as my favorite sports signstreaming contracts, that motivation is disappearing as well.And it's not just TV either. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife who hates TV. She reads instead. Amazon's Kindle Unlimited, for another $99 per year, became fantastic over the last year as more authors have signed up and Amazon's algorithms have gotten better at anticipating what people might want to borrow next from its vast library.My son doesn't watch TV either. He's a gamer, and has been for years. He is constantly talking aboutTwitch, which offers live streams of people playing video games. I don't get it, but Amazon does. They paid $970 million for Twitchlast March, making them partners with characters such as Bunnyfufu, who stream their gamingon Twitch.Like most people, I watch very few cable channels. Cancel cable and there is $100-150 per month I can pay for whatever programming I want. There are only so many hours in a day - who needs hundreds of channels with nothing on when a streaming service (or maybe two) can meet my needs?If I sound like an Amazon fanboy, it's because I am. As previously noted, my TV has an Amazon Fire Stick plugged into it, and I use a Fire tablet for reading. I also started accumulating Amazon shares in 2014, at an average price of $330. They're now worth about $800, and they're a bargain at that price.For the fourth quarter of 2016 Amazon earned $749 million, $1.54 per share, on revenues of$43.741 billion. It is making the turn from a company investing in front of growth to one that starts earning profits regularly. Its cloud operation, Amazon Web Services, now brings one-quarter of its $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue to the bottom line - and one of its customers is Netflix.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayImagine. Amazon creates infrastructure that lets other companies make money, then competes with its customers to make even more money with the same infrastructure. I recently dumped shares before earnings, at $832 per share, because they had become such a huge portion of my retirement account.I may have to buy them back.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockNetflix may have created the new business model and Amazon may have perfected it, but the technology began atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with Google and YouTube.One of YouTube's co-founders says the idea started afterthe Janet Jackson ""wardobe malfunction""at the 2004 Super Bowl. They just couldn't find any video of it, and so asked others to upload it so they could see it. The service was an immediate sensation, and Google's purchase of the site for $1.65 billion was just the beginning.The business model was simple. People upload videos, people watch videos. Google places ads in front of the videos, and shares some of the revenue with those who uploaded the videos. Like Google itself, it is a free service, although it now has a paid version called YouTube Red.YouTubedid not make a profit for its parentuntil after Amazon and Netflix got going. It is now estimated to be bringing in$10 billion per year, growing at 40% per year, with 80% of views outside the U.S. By 2020 that will mean$27 billionin revenue per year. Its audience is tilted toward young people, aged 18-34, the kind advertisers most covet, and a growing percentage access it via phones or tablets.An analysis from STL Partners indicates YouTube's profit contribution is mainly indirect. Its traffic helps Google get the best prices for internet bandwidth. Its meta data is contributed to other Google services. It gives Google a place at the tablewhenever video copyright issuesare discussed.Veteran TV producer Susanne Daniels joined Google in 2015, and is charged withgrowing the YouTube Red service. She is not onlybuying TV showsand makinga splash at movie festivalsbut aiming to take veteran TV hosts likeConan O'Brien online. (Chelsea Handler has already moved to Netflix.) Daniels is helped by continuing sales ofChromecast, a TV streaming device which competes with the Apple Fire StickYouTube has created its own stars, most of whom are unknown to their parents' generation. The most popular YouTube celebrity, PewDiePie, drew $15 million in income last year and hadalmost 50 million viewers.By taking advantage of Google's low-cost infrastructure, YouTube has carved out a unique niche for itself in the new TV universe, one that is subsidizing its entrance into more ""traditional"" areas like YouTube Red subscriptions.Thanks to Amazon's purchase of Twitch, TV stocks Google and Amazon are now on a collision course in the world of streaming video. Customers of both will be the big winners, but stockholders should do well, too.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Apple (AAPL)Source:via AppleApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) was a latecomer to TV streaming in the cloud.Apple began ramping up spending for its own cloud only a few years ago,investing $15 billion in 2016 aloneto build a global network of cloud data centers and, potentially, a place for itself in the new industry.The money was spent mainly to serve existing paid Apple services, like the sale apps, iCloud storage and iTunes, which are nowbigger profit drivers than the Macintosh or iPad. CEO Tim Cook said in his most recent earnings call that Apple Services brought in$7.17 billionin the December quarter alone, which he expects will double by 2020.Apple's streaming business is distinguished from that of Google because it consists of paid subscribers, and distinguished from Amazon and Netflix by being primarily fee-for-service rather than subscription revenue.While iPhone sales are stagnating, Apple has found a new growth engine in services, and built a platform to challenge the other streaming players. Apple Music now has about21%of the music streaming market,half that of rivalSpotify, but Spotify is not profitable and struggling to justify a $8 billion valuation, which at One Infinite Loop is considered seat cushion money.Apple's push into TV streaming will be through a new app called, simply,TV, which aims to solve one of the most vexing problems for a streaming user - deciding what to watch next. The Apple TV streaming service itself has yet to launch, butrumors about it abound. Apple wants to get the same 30% revenue cut on TV streaming it gets on apps, producing a service that will cost $20-30 per month.The most persistent rumors about Apple's intent regarding streaming involveHBO Now, a Time Warner service that costs $15 per month, and which was Apple exclusive for a few months in 2015. Apple has the financial wherewithal to buy HBO as part of Time Warner's merger with AT&T, or to buy a broadcasting company like CBS for cash. Apple TV hardware isused by an estimated 11.9%of TV streaming customers.Thanks to its existing service businesses, global reach and over $200 billion in cash, Apple has the freedom to be patient and negotiate with rights holders before launching a TV streaming service. But it is far more concerned with maintaining its high margins than with driving traffic, which hurts it in competition with services whose prices start at virtually free, like Google's YouTube and Amazon Prime.It is hard for me to see how Apple can win in streaming when it's unwilling to bend on margins to win market share, and willing to dither aimlessly with existing TV rights holders while rivals are creating their own shows and even new types of experiences.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendBut that's just my opinion. I bought Apple shares before its 7:1 split in 2014, sold about half, but retain them in my retirement account. It's going to be a nice retirement.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrI got my first glimpse of the future several years ago, when rights to English Premier League games came up for bids.The winners weren't the traditional networks, public or private. They wereSky TV, a direct broadcast satellite company, andBritish Telecom, the state phone company.This was years before AT&T said it would buy Time Warnerfor a reported $85.4 billion. It was even years before AT&T agreed to spend$48.5 billion forDirecTV, the direct broadcast satellite business.The two deals will combine to transform AT&T from a phone company into a streaming player. It will be able to bundle wireless, satellite and internet subscriptions, and let its customers stream shows from DirecTV to their mobile deviceswithout cost.Its new streaming service, DirecTV Now, carried an introductory price of $35 per month for 60 channels and attractedover 200,000 customers during the fourth quarterwhich helped offset a loss of customers from its more traditional cable service, U-Verse. It competes ina cord-cutting nichealongsideSling TV, owned by DirecTV rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), and Playstation Vue, owned bySony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE)For the fourth quarter, AT&T reported net income of $2.44 billion, 39 cents per share, on revenue of $41.84 billion. While this didn't clear the company's 49-cent-per-share dividend payment during the quarter, for the year the company did earn $2.10 per share, beating the $1.93 annual dividend. It's the dividend, a 4.7% yield to today's stock buyer, that you're buying when you buy AT&T stock. The shares themselves are worth little more than they were in 2007.I switched from Comcast to AT&T for my own TV and internet service last year, combining it with my existing mobile phone subscription. I now pay the company about $400 per month for various services. That's a lot of cash flow. I should probably buy the stock.AT&T is the most traditional of the new streaming players. It earns a place in this gallery for its sheer size, with annual revenue of $164 billion, and its control of key internet infrastructure in the core of the network and at the edge.AT&T has moved into streaming for defensive reasons. Internet advocates have criticized it for DirecTV Now, which gives its own customers free bits that others are charged for, ignoring the concept of network neutrality, but the Donald Trump Administration isgiving it a free pass on that.When the acquisition of Time Warner is finalized - and that looks like a better bet with Trump in charge - AT&T will own a big hunk of the traditional cable universe, including HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network.Time Warner agreed to be bought, in part, because it needs cash to compete for programming against deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix, Amazon, Google and possibly Apple. AT&T bought Time Warner because the vertical integration - owning the programming as well as the network so you write rights checks to yourself - should allow it to maintain that dividend.Comcast made the marriage of network infrastructure and content work with NBC Universal, mainly by keeping its hands off its creative people. It is still unclear to me whether AT&T will be willing to do the same, or whether it will focus on milking a dying industry for profits, which has been its way of doing business since I began covering them over three decades ago.That's the only thing keeping me from buying the shares. That and the lack of capital gains.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Facebook (FB)Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is the newest and, based on revenue, the second-smallest of the new streaming players, behind only Netflix.During the December quarter Facebookearned $1.41 per shareon $8.81 billion in revenue. This makes it four times bigger than Netflix by revenue. With a market cap of about $390 billion, it isthe sixth most valuable company in the country, less than five years after first going public.Facebook got into streaming withFacebook Live, a sort of YouTube for streaming, which has already made news with House Democrats streaming a sit-in when Republicans turned off their cameras and with Donald Trump announcing a Supreme Court pick on the service.Facebook Live is already getting Facebook into trouble with rights holders, like the TV network which saw sales of a recent pay-per-view fight in Australia impacted when one subscribersimply held his phone up to his TV and streamed it. There is even a name for this kind of thing -""stream ripping.""Facebook is reportedlyworking on an app for streaming, which would put it into more direct competition with Apple TV and Google's YouTube. This would be a software solution that lets it piggyback on others' hardware, like Chromecast, Amazon's Fire Stick and Apple TV. In addition to supporting its streaming, the app would also support 10-minute TV shows with commercials inserted into them,like broadcast TV in the 1940s.What makes Facebook powerful in streaming is the sheer number of people using the service - nearly 2 billion - and the amount of time they spend with it. The average global user spends 20 minutes per day on the service, andthe average American spends twice that amount of time.Analysts are divided on analogiesfor Facebook's strategy here. Is it Netflix? Is it YouTube?In fact, neither analogy is correct. Facebook mainly wants to integrate video into its existing offering. It is backing away frompaying publishers for streams, and may be backing away in the near term as people use its unmoderated do-it-yourself streaming to show themselvescommitting violent crimesandeven committing suicide.All this reminds me of something I wrote 20 years ago, about telephony. Telephony is simply an internet service. Today, video is the same, an internet service. The difference is that video is far more intimate than a phone call, easier to make money from and subject to discussion of rights, or right and wrong.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenIntegrating video, even streaming video, as just one part of a broader computer experience is the road not being taken by anyone but Facebook.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alibaba (BABA)Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) got into streaming in 2015 by buyingYouku Tudou, a Chinese version of YouTube,for $4 billion-plus.Alibaba was late to this business, but is working hard to make up for lost time. It launched a paid streaming service calledTmall Box Officein September, 2015. It has a TV operating systemcalled YunOS, which is getting its streaming services into homes throughout East and South Asia.In 2016, Alibaba launchedpartnerships with a host of global producers, the most important being with Steven Spielberg'sAmblin Entertainment, which is aiming to bring Chinese stories to American audiences and vice versa. Alibaba also took a stakein China'sHeHe Picturesand signed a deal withHarry Potterproducer David Heyman to produce a series of movies aroundWarriors,a children's book series about warring cats. Already in 2017 Alibaba has signed to becomea major sponsor of the Olympic Games, responsible for streaming events and back-end cloud computing.Thanks to deals like this, Alibaba's digital media revenues grew 270% year-over-year, inits most recent quarterly report.The segment produced $585 million in revenue.Despite all this, Alibaba is still a relative minnow in the streaming TV stocks waters. Its streaming revenue is just one-quarter that of Netflix. What makes it powerful, and a threat to the giants, is its strength throughout Asia, not just in China; its willingness to buy its way into businesses like movie production; and its highly profitable growth trajectory, which gives it a cash hoard worth $15 billion, which it is far more aggressive about investing than Apple.Because Alibaba enables commerce, rather than buying inventory as Amazon does, it brings over 25% of its revenue to the net income line, with operating cash flow that has grown four-fold in the last four years. It has enormous advantages in China, the world's second-largest and one of its fastest-growing markets. This has given it a springboard into other markets like India, Indonesia and Thailand, where it is also growing a range of services.It is just a matter of time before Alibaba becomes a major factor in the U.S. market, through its ownership of content and cloud operations if nothing else. Any innovation a U.S. company can come up with, moreover, can be jumped on by Alibaba in a flash, grown in China as a captive market, and then sprung on the world quickly.It may be the most important story of the next four years, but it won't be televised. It will definitely be streamed. I'm a buyer.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, available at the Amazon Kindle store.

Amazon's U.S. Online Sales Growth Last Year Was More Than Everyone Else's Combined;2/10/2017;"It's no secret thatAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a dominant force in online retail. But it's   still astounding just how dominant it's been in recent years. New   data fromSlice Intelligenceshows Amazon took 53% of all the sales growth of online retailers   in the US last year.Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% in 2016.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking e-commerce   sales growth around 15.5% through the first three quarters of the   year.Put another way, despite its size, Amazon continues to take   share of the growing e-commerce market, and competitors such asWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) are struggling to keep up.makeArticleAd();Image source: Amazon.com.$53 billion in retail sales up for grabsWhile the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released its estimates for   the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapolating out the steady   growth rate of the first three quarters results in $53 billion in   online sales for 2016. In addition, the majority of retail growth   in the United States comes from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total   growth came from online sales.Slice's numbers may be a bit off, considering Amazon saw an   increase of ""just"" $16 billion in sales across all of North   America. Still, the company is undoubtedly taking market share as   its sales growth outpaces the overall industry.With e-commerce accounting for such a significant share of   retail growth in the United States, Amazon's biggest competitors,   like Wal-Mart, are really feeling the hurt. While Amazon's North   American sales increased 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart's overall U.S.   sales increased just 3.3% through the first three quarters of the   year.Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales fared a bit better, increasing 7%,   11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters,   respectively. The third quarter was boosted by the acquisition of   Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart's organic e-commerce sales still   appear to lag the industry.How is Amazon dominating retail?Even if you're skeptical of Slice's claim that Amazon took 53%   of online sales growth last year, it's clear that Amazon accounts   for a huge share of the retail growth in the United States. Not   just e-commerce growth, but overall retail sales.Slice had a few thoughts to share on why Amazon has been able   to stay ahead of the competition:Faster shipping.Amazon's average ship time fell about 1.5 days over the past       two years, and it remains more than two days faster than the       average competitor, according to Slice's data. Wal-Mart       recently started offeringfree two-day shippingon about 2 million select items, but its selection pales in       comparison with the 50 million Prime-eligible items on       Amazon.Subscriptions.Amazon's subscribe-and-save feature allows customers to       automatically reorder a product, receive free shipping, and       get a discount to boot. That's quite an incentive to become a       repeat customer.Ease of ordering.Products such as Amazon's Echo smart speaker or its Dash       buttons make ordering products from Amazon easier than       putting on pants -- the very pants I ordered from Amazon.Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fueling Amazon's   continued dominance of retail in the United States is its Prime   program. Prime makes customers extremely loyal. It's what fuels   55% of online shoppers to check Amazon.com first (and maybe   last). And it causes shoppers to spend more on Amazon than their   non-Prime counterparts.Last year, Amazon added ""tens of millions"" of new Prime   members, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release. Unlike   the previous two years, when Amazon experienced around 50% annual   growth in membership, the company didn't provide a growth   rate.That may be because Prime membership is nearing saturation in   markets such as the United States. Estimates show more than half   of U.S. households are already Prime members. Still, with a   growing majority of households subscribed to Prime (even if that   growth is slowing) and going to Amazon as their first online   shopping destination, it looks as if Amazon will continue to take   share of the U.S. retail market for the foreseeable future.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

The 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stocks Today;2/10/2017;"The classic ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy advises buying the 10 highest-yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, then holding onto them for a year. The idea is that higher yields are a signal of a beaten-up share price - and that because we're buying a stable blue-chip with a stable customer base, investors will eventually bid the stock back up when the business cycle turns up again.But we can further improve on this effective yet somewhat ""dumb"" strategy with a bit of second-level analysis. After all, some of these companies have business models that are actually aging in dog years! And they should be avoided.Today we're going to discuss four high paying Dow components. Two are compelling buys, while two should be sold immediately (or even shorted).makeArticleAd();WINNER: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield:3.6%Exxon Mobil (XOM)is emerging from what easily has been one of the most trying points in the company's history, the roots of which stretch all the way back to 1870.From about mid-2014 through the start of 2016,oil pricesplunged from near $110 down to below $30 - a collapse that caused energy stocks across the sector to careen into the ground, and forced numerous companies to shut their doors.Even Exxon Mobil - America's biggest energy company by market capitalization, and one of the world's largest and most diversified oil and gas operations - wasn't immune. Shares dipped from around $105 to around $72 or so - a 30%-plus dip in just more than a year's time, which is virtually unheard of in blue chips as well-established as XOM. Pundits thought that Exxon's streak of dividend increases, which spanned more than three decades, was in jeopardy.However, former CEO Rex Tillerson himself managed the company in such a way that he knew its operations could survive with oil prices as low as $40 per barrel. April 2016 came around, and XOM maintained its status as a Dividend Aristocrat with a small but symbolic payout hike. Meanwhile, XOM shares have clawed back at least some of their losses.Speaking of Tillerson ...The former Exxon CEO is a ""former"" chief because he's now America's Secretary of State. That's no doubt a boon to XOM, especially considering the Trump administration's seemingly favorable and cooperative view with Russia - where Exxon has huge energy interests and projects, and where Tillerson himself has deep ties.Moreover, President Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress are proving extremely friendly to the energy sector as a whole right now, most recently with a Senate vote to knock down a rule governing transparency on energy firms' payments to foreign governments.Exxon was already set up well to benefit from an eventual return to high oil prices, and now it's seemingly in the driver's seat. While investors wait for those gains to take hold, they can enjoy 3.6% in dividends from this relentless oil titan.Exxon (XOM): This Long-Time Winner Is in Recovery ModeLOSER: Walmart (WMT)Dividend Yield:3%Walmart (WMT)is one of the perfect examples of how a big, solid blue-chip can still be a big, solid dud.Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, and in fact Earth's biggest company by revenue, boasting more than 11,000 stores across 28 countries. BeforeAmazon.com (AMZN)came around, Walmart was considered one of the biggest disruptors to traditional brick-and-mortar retail. Its bargain-basement prices and enormous product offerings upended countless mom n' pop shops, but also put the hurt to larger specialty retailers such asBest Buy (BBY)andH.H.Gregg (HGG).But Amazondidcome along, and that - along with Walmart's ubiquity and lack of options for expansion - are at the very least keeping Walmart from being the investment powerhouse it once was.While WMT does produce world-class revenues, top-line growth has been thinning for years, and in 2016, Walmart's sales actually dropped year-over-year:Walmart has been spending for years trying to bring its online offerings up to par to battle Amazon's unstoppable e-commerce machine - yet it just keeps falling farther behind. Dividend growth is lagging too - last year management upped its payout by a meager 2%. WMT has lagged the total returns of the S&P 500 for the last 15 years - it's time to cut this dead weight loose.WINNER: Boeing (BA)Dividend Yield:3.5%Boeing (BA)just boosted its dividend by 30% to $1.42 per share - more than double its quarterly payout from 2013! And Boeing's generosity to shareholders didn't stop there. The company also upgraded its old stock repurchase program by implementing a new $14 billion buyback plan.Future business prospects are looking good. Boeing said it expects 2017 commercial aircraft deliveries to reach between 760 and 765, up from last year's 748. Core earnings are expected to surge from $7.24 per share to a range of $9.10 to $9.30 per share. And Boeing sees cash flow ticking up from $10.5 billion last year to $10.75 billion in 2017 - plenty of cash to dish back to shareholders.Boeing's (BA) Dividend Takes OffLOSER: IBM (IBM)Dividend Yield:3.2%Nineteen straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines - nuff said.IBM's (IBM)core businesses, such as services and software licenses, have declined on a year-over-year basis for 19 straight quarters. And it's a bad sign that the company still won't break out its Watson revenues, despite the fact IBM says its promising artificial intelligence unit is growing briskly.IBM's 2016 dividend hike dipped into single digits after years of double-digit improvements. Cash and short-term investments have dipped from about $11 billion in 2013 to $8.5 billion as of its last report ... and long-term debt has climbed from $32.9 billion to $34.7 billion in that same time.And that streak of consecutive revenue declines? If Wall Street is right, it'll be extended at least by a couple more quarters, and both 2017 and 2018 revenues are seen eroding, not recovering.IBM might survive for an eternity, but it won't grow your money for you.IBM (IBM) Revenues Just Keep SinkingForget stocks that can merely survive forever - you need stocks that cangrow forever!

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.makeArticleAd();The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the future of software.If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and itsearnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps withautonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch andAudi.All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.All thanks to Nvidia."

Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit $15 Soon;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is nothing more painful for investors than watching a stock that once traded at $1.81 soaring six-fold in the last year. The higher shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) goes, the riskier it gets for investors. AMD stock still has $1.44 billion in debt against $1.26 billion in cash and equivalents. In early March, the chip supplier is about to make its biggest launch its his history with Ryzen, and that's bound to make a lot of noise.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrFor the time being, details of AMD's Ryzen are limited. Although the company recently demoed the chip in a gameplay demonstration, it gave no details on the chip's pricing.Without knowing what Ryzen offers at a price-to-performance ratio compared toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), the harder it is to predict Ryzen's sales when it launches.AMD's (Leaked) Ryzen RoadmapIf theleaked rumorsare true, AMD will launch three classes of PC chips: high-range, medium-range and entry-level. Denoted R7 (8 core, 16 threads), R5 (4-6 core, 8-12 threads) and R3 (4 core, 4 threads), respectively, the CPUs will differ by core, thread and clock speed. The mid- and high-range chips will compete with Intel's mainstream processors, the i5 and i7.Click to EnlargeRyzen's processor speed does not aim to out-clock that of Intel chips. Rather, AMD's strategy primarily targets the enthusiast PC game community. Ryzen will pair with the next-generation GPU (graphics processing unit) Vega chips.After Ryzen's launch in March, AMD will release Vega sometime in the second quarter. Mentions of Ryzen picked up again on Feb 9.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendRyzen's Processor SizeAlthough Advanced Micro Devices ismanufacturingZen on 14nm, its an area of 44 square millimeters implies that the chip will at least match or beat Intel's chips. Before Lisa Su's leadership, AMD did not talk about manufacturing at 14nm.Prior to Ryzen, Advanced Micro Devices embraced x86 chips at 28nm. The engineering achievement will lead to lower manufacturing costs and higher profit margins for AMD stock. On its conference call, the company revealed that it aimed to achieve gross margin of around 33% in the first quarter. In the quarters before that, its gross margin hovered in the 31%-range due to the product mix. With Ryzen on the list, expect that profitability number to improve quarter after quarter.Manufacturing of the processor will only get better andgo all the way down to 7nm:""They are not just buying a point product and we have a multi-generational roadmap that we are working on, including sort of the Zen 2 and the Zen 3 follow on. From our standpoint process technology, we ramped 16nm and 14nm really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7nm and we think the 7nm foundry roadmaps that are available are very competitive and will ensure that we have a strong multi-generational roadmap.""AMD stock's valuations may scare investors ahead of the Ryzen launch. But since the Polaris GPU launch last year, CEO Lisa Su proved her technical skills in leading product launches. Advanced Micro Devices gained market share when it priced Polaris competitively againstNvidia Corporation's(NASDAQ:NVDA) more expensive GTX cards.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkChances are good that AMD will price Ryzen to win market share from Intel. The i5 and i7 Kaby Lake processors did not win rave reviews from the technology community.Bottom Line for AMD StockAdvanced Micro Devices is hovering at near yearly highs, while Intel stock is showing a ""double top"" at around $38 a share. The marketplace is right in embracing Ryzen's release next month. Its chip performance, lower energy consumption compared to past chips and, hopefully, a competitive price could lift the AMD stock price to at least $15 a share. That implies a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 50, compared to 43 with Nvidia.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postWhy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

3 Big Bets Cisco Systems, Inc.

While there are many companies   working to provide services for individuals' and companies' cloud   needs, Cisco is gearing up to offer its services to cities around   the world.Cisco launched the ""Smart+Connected City Platform"" at   the Smart City Expo World Congress 2016 in Barcelona in   November, and the company says this service is ""a centralized   layer for addressing the infrastructural need to connect cameras,   water meters, traffic meters, and so on in a reliable, secure,   robust and seamless manner."" This initiative was recently   implemented in Jaipur, India, which joins Hamburg, Germany;   Barcelona, Spain; Kansas City, Missouri; and Adelaide, Australia   as test smart cities. The video below shows the CIO of Adelaide   explaining the importance Cisco has played in his city.makeArticleAd();2: Becoming an all-encompassing IoT platform""Internet of Things"" has become a buzzword in 2016, but really   it just describes the growing trend of consumer or otherwise   low-tech items that are being connected to the internet and to   each other, usually through a wireless cloud network. In fact,   the smart cities initiative is mostly about IoT on city level.   Estimates on just how big this market could be vary widely, but   most analysts predict it could continue growing by tens ofbillionsof devices in the next few years.Cisco is increasingly making itself the bedrock for various   parts of this ecosystem, including the actual hardware that makes   these consumer products connectivity possible, the connectivity   through cloud networks, and the security to make sure the IoT   connectivity isn't easily compromised. Cisco acquired a   cloud-based IoT company called Jasper Technologies last March for   $1.4 billion, which, among other things, enables more   data-tracking and IoT management. This acquisition and others   like it, along with Cisco's own innovation in this space, have   helped the company to launch various new products and bundles   into this space recently.Similar to Cisco's smart+connected cities push, the company   believes it has the breadth of expertise and support to be the   IoT platform for enterprise and governmental accounts. Remember   that Cisco already has a large footprint in these spaces, so it   might be easier for them to win over these big clients as they   seek an IoT solution.Image source: Cisco Systems.3: CybersecurityWhile the first two areas above are incredibly exciting in   terms of what they could mean for the future of the digital   world, they also open up the world to many more risks in the form   of cyber-threats. A recently intensified focus on hacking threats   and the need to build secure solutions throughout cloud networks,   IoT platforms, and all other connected technology creates an   opportunity Cisco is taking advantage of.In February, the company launched Cisco Firepower, a new   firewall series, and the company says its advanced security   systems have been proven to help customers ""dramatically reduce   time to detection of attacks."" Throughout the year, the company   also launched new tools such as Cisco Umbrella and Umbrella   Roaming, which are increased defenses on routers and VPN devices   to block suspicious activity. In September, Cisco   acquired CloudLock, a company that helps provide integrated   security solutions for cloud-based networks.Cisco's security revenue in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 29 rose   11% from the year-earlier quarter to about $540 million. Even   though that makes up less than 5% of Cisco's total revenue,   management believes that having the focus and expertise in this   area will help them win over more business within its other   segments as consumers and businesses start to consider the need   for the most secure network possible a top priority.Can Cisco fend off competition?Cisco's traditional markets, which still make up the bulk of   sales, have declined in recent quarters. Switching, which still   makes up nearly a third of total sales, slumped 7% in the most   recent quarter year over year. Overall, even with the growth   above, total sales in the quarter gained a paltry 1%.   Additionally, management gave less-than-exciting guidance for   early fiscal 2017.More concerning is that in the company's new growth areas, it   faces some serious competition. The biggest of them   is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers both public and   private cloud hosting solutions, as well as IoT solutions,   usually for a lower cost than traditional options. The service   has success stories from some big names likeNetflixandComcast, just to name a few, which has helped raise its prestige. In   terms of security, Amazon provides cloud services to U.S.   intelligence agencies, so clearly, security is important to them   as well. AWS is growing quickly -- up nearly 50% year over year   in the most recent quarter to over $3.5 billion.The early successes of the segments above are encouraging.   Additionally, Cisco has been able to gain a lot of expertise and   value from acquiring smaller tech companies in these high-growth   segments, and Cisco is in a great position to continue that   strategy with around $70 billion in cash that it's likely to   start deploying more heavily in the quarters and years to come.   While Cisco will certainly face increased growth pressure ahead,   especially with AWS disrupting this space, it looks to be making   some smart moves to transition its focus. Finally, Cisco is   trading at just 15 times earnings, just 2.5 times book value   (compared with Amazon's P/B at 21.7 times), and has a 3.3%   dividend yield that continues to grow. It looks like there's   plenty of reason to hold Cisco to see how these markets transform   in the years ahead -- and how this behemoth tech company will   play a part in them.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late December, I made apredictionthatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock would hit $80 in 2017. In reality, it was less a prediction than my agreement with Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin's 12-month price target for MSFT stock of $80.makeArticleAd();Source:Via MicrosoftMore than one month into the year and the Microsoft stock price has a long way to go to reach this lofty goal.It's fair to say that if MSFT stock is going to hit $80, Microsoft's burgeoning cloud business - an annualized revenue run rate of $14.0 billion as of Q2 2017 - needs to deliver more growth over the next three quarters (April, July and October earnings announcements) to justify to investors a forward2018price-to-earnings ratio of 24.5.As I said in my earlier article, I think MSFT can deliver on this front.But it got me thinking about Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the world's richest person at $85 billion and the owner of approximately 179 million shares of MSFT stock, a number that's been dwindling by approximately80 millionper year over the past decade or so; the proceeds going to fund the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.If this pace continues Bill Gates will have reduced his Microsoft stake to zero by sometime in 2019.Should Bill Gates Sell His MSFT Stock?No, I'm not talking about whether he should continue to fund his foundation - of course, he should -I'm merely wondering if there wasn't a better stock to sell to fund the foundation's good works.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayA quicklookat the financial statements for the foundation's 2015 and 2014 fiscal years shows that $11.3 billion was spent over the course of two years to fund its programs around the world, an average of $5.65 billion per year, about the same amount that Gates would currently generate from the sale of 80 million shares of Microsoft stock.So, from a financial planning standpoint, the 80 million figure makes a whole lot of sense.The holdings of the trust that oversees the investments and cash donated by the Gates's along with Warren Buffett for use by the foundation had a value of $18.5 billion as of September 30, 2016; more than half (57.8%) of the portfolio invested inBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Class B stock.Since August 24, 2006 through July 2015, Buffett has donated 200.6 million shares of Class B Berkshire Hathaway shares to the foundation; this past year, Buffett donated roughly15 millionshares. The remaining 285 million shares he agreed to donate back in June 2006 will be doled out at a rate of 5% per year until all 500 million shares are in the hands of the foundation sometime around 2036.So, the choice comes down to whether it makes sense to sell the shares of Microsoft for cash to fund the foundation's work and continue to hold the Berkshire Hathaway shares as an investment or the other way around.The Gates have chosen the former rather than the latter.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkOn the surface, that would seem to be a mistake given MSFT stock has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway Class B stock by 269 basis points on annuallized basis over the last five years through Feb. 6.So, with that in mind, does it make sense for Bill Gates to sell his MSFT stock?I don't think he should as some of its best growth lies in the immediate future. But, I also don't think the trust should sell Berkshire Hathaway stock because it provides such good diversification and protection of capital.Both of these stocks are worth owning for the long haul.If it were up to me, I'd probably look at cashing in some of the trust's other holdings first, but thankfully for all those around the world deserving of the good education and healthcare the foundation looks to fund, it's not up to me.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendThe postShould Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home connected speaker takes onAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.However, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.The Battle for the Smart HomeGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out asimilar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.Home ControlGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, afterselling nine times moreof the smart speaker than the previous year.Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceNo, Apple Inc.

"News Corp (NWSA) Q2 Earnings Top; Soft Ad Market Hurt Sales";2/10/2017;"Rupert Murdoch-controlled,News CorporationNWSAreported profit in second-quarter fiscal 2017 after posting loss in the previous quarter.  Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by robust performance of digital real-estate and book publishing units. However, the company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter primarily due to soft print advertising demand and foreign currency headwinds.News Corporation registered adjusted earnings of 19 cent a share outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 5% year over year. Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post reported net loss from continuing operations of 50 cents a share compared with earnings of 15 cents posted in the year-ago period.News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.FOXA, stated that its total revenue for the reported quarter was $2,116 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,137 million.

Adjusted revenues fell 5% from the prior-year period. Advertising revenues decreased 9%, hurt by the adverse impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the print advertising market, partly offset by $22 million from the addition of Wireless Group and increased in-store product revenues at News America Marketing.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 5%. However, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the figure inched up 1% on account of increase in subscription pricing, selected rise in cover prices in the U.K. and Australia and jump in paid digital subscribers, partly neutralized by fall in print volume. Digital revenues accounted for 27% of segment revenues in the quarter under review compared with 22% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 10% during the quarter to $142 million.TheBook Publishingsegment reported revenues of $466 million, up 4% from the prior-year period owing to continued success of backlist titles comprising Hillbilly Elegy by J.D.

While adjusted EBITDA for News Corporation's book publishing business surged 35% to $77 million.Revenues at theDigital Real Estate Servicessegment advanced 16% year over year to $242 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group Limited (up 19%) and Move (up 7%), along with the buyout of iProperty and Diakrit. Adjusted revenues grew 10% in the quarter under review, while adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $92 million.TheCable Network Programmingsegment's revenues came in at $104 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter primarily due to decline in affiliate and advertising revenues.

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’s go though the numbers.In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down."

Why I’m Raising My Price Target On Microsoft Corporation Stock (MSFT);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you thinkMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) shares are expensive now, they are about to get even more so.makeArticleAd();Back in December,I issueda 12-month piece target of $72 per share. But following the company's breathtaking fiscal second-quarter earnings results, I am now confident is too cheap.As such I'm raising my price target by $8 per share to $80 per share.Why the price increase? For starters, Microsoft stock is currently priced at a forward P/E of just 21 based on fiscal 2017 estimates of $2.97 per share. And while that P/E is two points above the average stock in the S&P 500 index, Microsoft's recent moves suggests it deserves a much higher multiple.With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of the cloud, Internet-of-Things, smart home and a host of other areas thanks to its recent acquisitions, Microsoft stock still looks like a bargain. I'll get back to this in a moment. But let's first assess its recent earnings.The main question heading into 2017 was to what extent Microsoft could sustain the strong cloud momentum it used in 2016 to surpassAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN).Microsoft answered that question with authority. In three months that ended December, the company earned $5.2 billion, or 66 cents per share, rising from $5.02 billion a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to 84 cents per share, which beat the consensus estimate of 79 cents per share. Second-quarter revenue came in at $24.1 billion, while adjusted revenue was $26.1 billion, also topping Wall Street estimates.The company's aggressive move towards the cloud was the main driver of the strong top- and bottom-line beat. Not only does this lessen Microsoft's reliance on declining PC sales, but cloud businesses also generate higher margins. Revenue from the Office 365 business grew almost 50% year-over-year, while gross margins in its commercial cloud business, which includes Azure and Office 365 products sold to businesses, reached 48% during the quarter - up two percentage points year-over-year.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth Potential""Our customers are seeing greater value and opportunity as we partner with them through their digital transformation,"" said CEO Satya Nadella in a statement. ""Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.""Azure revenue surged 93% year-over-year (up 95% in constant currency) during the quarter. Though Microsoft provided no specific dollar amount to help break down the cloud revenue, Bernstein analysts Mark Mordler estimates Azure now generates some 20% of commercial cloud revenue, which Microsoft said was generating an ""annualized run rate"" just north of $14 billion, according to Barron's. This means Azure now generates quarterly revenue at around $3 billion.Between now and 2020, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion. This is double the revenue the industry is expected to generate by the end of 2016, according to a research firm IDC.""Cloud software will significantly outpace traditional software product delivery over the next five years, growing nearly three times faster than the software market as a whole and becoming the significant growth driver to all functional software markets,"" said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, SaaS and Business Models. ""By 2020, about half of all new business software purchases will be of service-enabled software, and cloud software will constitute more than a quarter of all software sold.""IDC is not alone in this prediction. Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecasts public cloud spending, currently around $58 billion annually, will triple to $205 billion in the next three years. During that span, Bracelin sees spending on SaaS services to surge 20% annually, reaching $129 billion by 2020.As Microsoft's cloud business takes up greater portions of its total revenue, Microsoft stands to secure larger pieces of the cloud pie. And Microsoft, which during the second quarter completed its blockbuster $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, now has even more ways to attract businesses to Azure. To that end, Microsoft stock should command a higher P/E of 4 to 6 points above its current valuation.When applying a P/E of just 25 to fiscal 2018 estimates of $3.26 per share, this puts the stock's fair value at around $80. That valuation is still more than half that of Amazon, which relies on its AWS cloud platform for the bulk of its profits. And with almost $121 billion in cash on its balance sheet make more deals for growth in key areas, Microsoft, which also pays a 2.45% annual dividend yield, is a stock to own and forget about.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkRisks To Consider:Much of my optimism is based on the assumption that Microsoft can continue to increase cloud market share and successfully integrate LinkedIn.Action To Take:Microsoft should be kept on the watchlist of investors who are looking for a company with upside potential that pays a reliable dividend.Editor's Note:All Wall Street firms closely-guard theirblack box trading systemsto gain an edge over their competition.

Reinventing Retail: What if GoPro, Garmin, and Fitbit Rethought Everything?;2/9/2017;"One of the realities of business today is that retail in 2017   little resembles retail of a decade ago. Product companies used   to succeed or fail based on their distribution power and the   shelf space retailers gave them, and retailers succeeded or   failed by having the right product at the best price for   consumers. Scale in retail mattered and that's how retailers   became power brokers in the product world.Retail today has been completely flipped on its head. A great   product from a small business can be a hit because its customers   share their experience online. Going viral can be more important   than being in the right retailers in 2017. Today, anyone can open   a store online or onAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Etsy,eBay, or any number of other platforms.The product development landscape that used to rely on large   companies to succeed has been flattened in a way that allows   someone in a garage to create a great product and get it out to   the world. All of this seems logical today, but so many companies   are still built as if the old retail model still exists. Product   companies likeGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) ,Fitbit(NYSE: FIT) , andGarmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) are a great example of this -- and if they're   going to succeed, they may have to rethink their business models   to incorporate the retail realities of 2017.makeArticleAd();Drones are growing in popularity, but are they really a     retail impulse purchase in 2017? Image source: GoPro.The old retail model is ancient historyThe old retail model for a product company essentially had   three to four layers, depending on the channel. There was   manufacturing, the product company would then have inventory on   hand to fill orders, there may be a distributor who sells   multiple product lines, and then there's the retailer themselves.   Manufacturing has to line up with end user demand, but in between   is two to three layers of channel inventory that's incredibly   complex to get exactly right, particularly if you're a   holiday-based business.This model creates two challenges for companies like GoPro,   Fitbit, and Garmin. First is that they have to get their product   inventory build right so they don't miss the critical holiday   season, but can't build too much or there's excess inventory. The   second problem is that retailers have to make money, so they're   cutting into margin compared to if products were directly sold to   customers. Why not cut out the middleman?The inventory problemI don't think I can overstate how much of a problem inventory   is for product companies or how quickly it can erase years' worth   of profits. Companies have to try to guess what demand will be   months in advance, build product to ship to stores, and then if   demand isn't as strong as they predicted, they usually have to   take product back from retailers.Image source: Garmin.In the fourth quarter of 2016, Fitbit says it will take a   one-time writedown of $68 million for ""tooling equipment and   component inventory,"" increase return reserves by $41 million   because of ""greater channel inventory,"" and take another $37   million charge for ""increased rebates and channel pricing   promotions"". That's $146 million in charges during a single   quarter that was driven by too much inventory in the retail   channel. That quickly erased most of the $176 million in net   income from 2015, which was a record for the company.Something similar happened at GoPro in 2015. Fourth-quarter   2015 results included $21 million in lost revenue from ""price   protection related charges"" and $57 million in costs associated   with ""excess purchase order commitments, excess inventory and   obsolete tooling."" The $78 million in charges didn't quite offset   2014's full-year net income of $128 million, but it took a big   chunk out of past success.Building the right amount of inventory is tough for companies   like this, especially when they're selling into a channel with   multiple layers of distribution inventory. Maybe it would be   better to do a 100% direct business model, especially when you   consider the value retailers are taking out of potential   profits.Direct sales are the product cash cowRetailers can bring products to millions of potential   customers, but they need to make money to do so. And that makes   retail sales far less profitable for product companies than going   direct to consumers. Here's an example of how the trade-off   looks.Let's assume a retailer has a gross margin of 30%. So, GoPro   would only make $279 on a Hero 5 Black that retails for $399. And   that's before any promotion or volume discounts a retailer may be   given that are then passed on to customers (think Black Friday   deals on GoPro cameras this year).If we assume that it costs $200 to make a Hero 5 Black (based   on margins for the company), then GoPro makes about $79 per   product sold at retail. But if GoPro sold the exact same camera   directly to a customer on its website it would get the entire   $399 and have a $199 margin. On the bottom line, a direct sale is   worth 2.5 times that of each retail camera sale.GoPro sold 2.28 million GoPro units last quarter and a little   over half went through a distribution channel. But if GoPro would   have sold every camera directly to customers, it could have sold   at least 25% fewer units and actually made more money. And this   is before we even consider the sales staff and inventory that   could be eliminated if a company only sold directly to   customers.This is a hypothetical example, but it should be directionally   accurate for product companies. Selling in retail isn't the   highest-margin business any of these companies have, and it may   not be worth the effort at all when you consider the charges a   company has to take if they get their inventory buildout   wrong.Less risk, more profitWhen I look at companies like GoPro, Fitbit, and Garmin, I see   a businesses that could survive very easily without any retail   presence at all. A $400 action camera or $500 triathlon watch   isn't exactly an impulse purchase, so customers will find your   products if they're the very best. And if these companies went   with a more direct model, they may generate significantly higher   profits even if sales fall. On top of that, a simpler   distribution model means they could take less inventory risk.Changing business models may be hard, but the retail business   isn't what it once was, and if it's not a huge benefit to a   business, then why pursue it at all? As traditional retail slowly   dies, I think it's time for product companies to look for better   strategic alternatives. GoPro, Fitbit, and Garmin may be better   off building on top of their brands with a direct model rather   than trying to reach everyone in retail.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever;2/9/2017;"The ""simple"" method of buying and holding a stock really isn't   all that simple. Some companies might post stable growth for   years, but suddenly be crushed by technological shifts or new   competitors.Therefore, stocks that you can buy and hold ""forever"" should   have well-diversified businesses, wide competitive moats, and   solid plans for future growth. Let's take a look at three   companies that clearly fit those criteria --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Disney(NYSE: DIS) , andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) .AmazonAmazon is one of my top ""forever"" holdings for three reasons.   First, it owns the most visited e-commerce website in  the   world. Second, its ""prisoner-taking"" Prime ecosystem continues   expanding with new features and perks that brick-and-mortar   rivals are struggling to match. Last June, research firm CIRP   estimated that Amazon's Prime member base in the U.S. had grown   43% annually to 63 million, and that Prime shoppers spend an   average of $1,200 per year -- compared to $500 for   non-members.makeArticleAd();Amazon's Prime Air. Image source: Amazon.Lastly, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the biggest cloud   platform in the world, and its higher operating margin (26% last   quarter) supports the company's other lower margin and   loss-leading efforts. AWS has an annual run rate of $14 billion,   and its revenue and operating profit respectively rose 47% and   60% annually last quarter.The combination of the growing Prime ecosystem, connected   hardware devices like the Kindle, Fire TV, and Echo speakers, and   the AWS backbone make Amazon the 800-pound gorilla in both retail   and cloud computing -- and I believe that it can continue   dominating both markets (and other adjacent ones) for decades to   come.DisneyIf you believe that Disney's theme parks and movie franchises   will still be making money hand over fist decades from now, then   the House of Mouse is the ideal stock to hold forever. In theme   parks and resorts, Disney's footprint continues to grow with its   new Shanghai Disney Resort, new extensions (like Star Wars Land)   for its existing parks, and a growing fleet of cruise ships. In   movies, Disney continues generating billions of dollars in box   office revenues per year with its carefully crafted Marvel, Star   Wars, and Pixar franchises -- which are all built to last for   decades.Disney's only soft spot is its media business, which has been   hurt by consumers ""cutting the cord"" in favor of streaming-only   platforms. A key concern is that ESPN, the crown jewel of the   business, has been losing subscribers, disproving the notion that   live sports were insulated from cord cutters. However, Disney hasbeen expandingits core cable brands, like ESPN, away from traditional pay TV   platforms and toward websites, apps, and stand-alone streaming   platforms.Over time, I believe that the media business' dependence on   pay TV platforms will decline, and that the weight of its theme   park and film businesses will increase. That gradual evolution   should make Disney a safe stock to own for generations to   come.FacebookFacebook finished last quarter with  1.86 billion monthly   active users -- about a quarter of the entire world population.   That's a moat that's nearly impossible for any competitor to   cross, and makes the company the 800-pound gorilla of social   networking and a formidable rival toAlphabet's Google in the internet advertising space.In addition to its flagship site, Facebook owns Instagram,   which hit 600 million active users last  December, and   WhatsApp, which hit  1.2 billion active users last month.   It's also been turning Messenger, which has over a billion users,   into a gigantic platform for reaching businesses, making mobile   payments, and playing games.The Oculus Rift. Image source: Oculus VR.Lastly, Facebook owns Oculus VR, the maker of the seminal Rift   headset. Facebook also launched its own VR platform with Oculus   Home, a VR launcher for Rift and Gear VR headsets. Users can   already chat and play games with each other in that VR   environment, so it's likely only a matter of time before users   will visit each other's Facebook or Instagram profiles in a VR   environment. Facebook's growth will inevitably slow down over the   next few decades, but it will likely keep generating billions of   dollars in advertising revenue as it expands its ecosystem into   adjacent markets.Think in decades, not quarters...Many analysts are currently focused on Amazon, Disney, and   Facebook's near-term challenges. They're worried about Amazon's   rising logistics expenses and the perceived slowdown in AWS' top   line growth. They think that Disney's streaming efforts might not   offset its losses in pay TV subscribers, and they probably think   Facebook is running out of room to grow.But as a long-term investor, you should ask yourself if   Amazon, Disney, and Facebook will continue growing over the next   few decades. If so, then you should consider buying and holding   these stocks for several decades instead of a few quarters.10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers;2/9/2017;"Shares ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant   posted mixed fourth quarter earnings and  soft guidance for   the first quarter. Revenue rose 22% annually to $43.7 billion,   but that  missed expectations by $980 million. The company   was hit hard by currency headwinds, which reduced its top line by   about $558 million. Amazon's closely watched AWS (Amazon Web   Services) revenue rose 47% annually to $3.54 billion, but that   also missed expectations of $3.6 billion and represented a   slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expects 14.1% to 22.7%   year-over-year sales growth, which missed analyst forecasts for   23.4% growth. But on a currency neutral basis, which excludes an   expected currency impact of $730 million, Amazon expects its   revenue to rise 17% to 25%.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Some negative reports about Amazon focused on those headline   numbers, but they glossed over many of the positive growth   figures. Let's take a look at six incredible numbers from that   report that investors shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDuring the fourth quarter, Amazon's net income rose 55%   annually to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat   expectations by $0.19. For the full year, its net income surged   over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid   growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more   freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin   hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like   Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new   fulfillment centers and drones.2. AWS' operating margin of 26%AWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%,   compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion   indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price   competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon   and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of   $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claimed that its ""commercial cloud"" had achieved an   annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of   that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics   CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the   IaaS/PaaS ""cloud platform"" markets -- accounts for a much smaller   percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates,   but  combining earlier industry estimates and its reported   growth rate  over the past few quarters indicates that its   annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AWS featuresAmazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC,   andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the   platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure   with new features. Amazon added over  1,000 new features and   services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in   2015.It also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five   geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42   Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data   center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and   developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce   and digital ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video,   the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the   platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone   subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.Like Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content,   and popular shows likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelped it become the third largest video streaming platform in   the U.S. after YouTube and  Netflix last year, according to   research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead   and investing heavily in localized original content in key   markets like Japan and India, which could help  expand its   Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skills for AlexaAmazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000   new skills since last October. It noted that ""tens of thousands   of developers"" are building new skills for the platform -- which   powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was   working with ""a lot of major companies"" to integrate their   products with that ecosystem.The expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it   can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash   buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In   addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with ""frictionless""   orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its   moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based   ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.The key takeawayAmazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors   shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect   Amazon's revenue and  earnings to respectively rise 22% and   53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon.   Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of   Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the   long term.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Grubhub Inc: 3 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons to Sell;2/9/2017;"Shares ofGrubHub(NYSE: GRUB)  slipped more than 3% on Feb. 8 after the food   delivery company posted mixed  fourth quarter earnings.   Revenue rose 38% annually to $137.5 million, narrowly beating   expectations by $0.2 million.Unfortunately, GrubHub's non-GAAP net income rose just 19%   annually to $16.7 million, or $0.23 per share, missing Wall   Street estimates by two cents. Its GAAP-adjusted net income rose   21% annually to $13.6 million, or $0.16 per share.Image source: Grubhub.makeArticleAd();For investors who aren't familiar with GrubHub, the company is   the top online delivery and takeout ordering marketplace in the   country. Its portfolio includes GrubHub, Seamless, LAbite,   Restaurants on the Run, DiningIn, and Delivered Dish. The company   works with over 50,000 restaurant partners in over 1,100 U.S.   cities and London.Despite its post-earnings swoon, shares of GrubHub remain up   almost 90% over the past 12 months. To figure out where GrubHub   is headed this year, let's discuss three reasons to buy and three   reasons to sell this hot stock.Three reasons to buy GrubhubGrubHub's active diners (unique accounts which ordered       within the past 12 months) rose 21% annually to 8.17 million       last quarter. That represents an acceleration from its 19%       growth in the third quarter.GrubHub's daily average grubs (orders) also rose 21%       annually to 274,800, compared to 26% growth in the third       quarter. GrubHub now  serves daily active grubs in 22       markets, compared to just seven at the time of its IPO in       2014. Those increased orders boosted its gross food sales by       33% to $735 million, which exceeded the company's prior       target of $500 million for the year.GrubHub also posted solid guidance. It expects its first       quarter revenue to rise 32%-39%, and its full-year revenue to       grow 26%-34%. On the bottom line, Grubhub expects its EBITDA       to rise 14%-30% for the first quarter, and 14%-31% for the       full year. All those figures matched analyst       expectations.Three reasons to sell GrubhubFirst and foremost,Amazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) restaurant delivery service, which is free       for Prime members, representsa growing threatto GrubHub. Amazon launched the service in late 2015, and it       has since expanded to 19 major cities across the U.S. Last       June, research firm CIRP claimed that Amazon's Prime user       base in the U.S. had grown 43% annually to 63 million. As       Amazon strengthens the bonds between Prime Now deliveries,       Echo speakers, and the rest of its ecosystem, GrubHub's       service could be marginalized.To counter Amazon and other rivals in the crowded food       delivery market, GrubHub plans to spend more money on tech,       sales, and marketing. During the quarter, it hired about 40       engineers and analytics experts from Zoomer to boost the       efficiency of its driver network efficiency, and it plans to       boost its sales and marketing spend by over 20% this year.       Those moves will weigh down its margins, which had been       gradually improving since its IPO.Source:YChartsThat bottom line pressure is troubling, because GrubHub's       valuation is pretty lofty. Analysts expect Grubhub's non-GAAP       earnings to grow 26% this  year, but that isn't high       enough to justify its trailing P/E of 75, which is much       higher than the industry average of 50 for internet       information providers. GrubHub's forward P/E of 35 looks       cheaper, but it merely matches its projected growth rate for       the year.The verdict: Avoid Grubhub for nowGrubHub has been a solid growth stock over the past year, but   its rising expenses, slowing bottom line growth, valuations, and   vulnerability to Amazon indicate that it has more downside   potential than upside potential. Therefore, I think GrubHub might   go higher, but the risks outweigh the rewards at current   prices.10 stocks we like better than GrubhubWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Prospective investors already knew   that Snap is a big spender atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on   for its cloud infrastructure needs.Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party   infrastructure vendorsat the scale at which it is operating; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they   grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap   also purchases infrastructure services fromAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on   its relationship with the e-commerce giant.Always have a contingency planTo be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it   never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is   absolutely critical when your entire service relies on   third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that   AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's   triggering the S-1 amendment.In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently   negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for   redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.""   That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also   committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the   next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our   business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS   that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on   Feb. 8, 2017.That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with   $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the   bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in   2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021.   In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized   on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five   years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to   subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years).Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author.Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud,   we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS   over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying   entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational   reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the   start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in   a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure   costs are the largest component of cost of revenue.Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in   October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company   will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure   spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the   years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating   expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year.Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Voice Control Platforms a Key Technology Trend in 2017;2/9/2017;"Technology companies have spent years on computational linguistics to solve the basic problem of making machines more efficient in an era where they would have to deal with bigger data loads and more complex queries. One of the products of this research is voice driven artificial intelligence that can connect and drive everyday devices to understand human speech and react accordingly.The most basic form of voice technology is a person directing a machine to do routine tasks such as play a track, read the mail, send automated response to mails and such things that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home automation is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appliances used in the home can also take voice commands? And sync with each other to decide the desirable activity and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhile Microsoft has many years of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat has really taken voice controlled platforms mainstream. The company launched its first Echo device a couple of years ago and sold more than seven million devices last year. While many of them were the cheaper Dot, it still puts Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant into that many new homes.At this year's CES, Amazon had a coup as companies ranging from FordF, Huawei and LG to a large number of startups unveiled phones, cars, home appliances and other gadgets with Alexa integration making Amazon's voice assistant that much more useful.And Amazon has doubled down to develop Alexa's ""skills,"" which are discrete voice-based applications that allow the system to carry out specific tasks (like ordering pizza for example). At launch, Alexa had just 20 skills, which has reportedly jumped to 5,200 today with the company adding about 100 skills per day.In fact, Bezos has said, ""We've been working behind the scenes for the last four years, we have more than 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo ecosystem … It's just the tip of the iceberg.""Just last week, it launched a new website to help brands and developers create more skills for Alexa. It also has a home consultation service called ""simplify your life"" where Amazon reps teach you to automate your home using Echo and Alexa. But all this works simply because everything is connected with AWS, which transmits data between different devices.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGoogle Has Jumped InAmazon is clearly the leader in voice controlled platforms today, but competition is in hot pursuit. Google Home was launched late last year and the search leader will do all it can to grow market share.To prove the point Google too had some important announcements for the Google Assistant, which drives Google Home. But some of the most important deals were for integrations into Hyundai's navigation system, Chrysler's 300 model, NVIDIA'sNVDAShield TV as well as others such as Belkin smart switches, Switchmate smart lights, Coway Airmega air purifiers, etc. Google still has miles to go before it catches up with Amazon, but it's made a strong start.Google has the most to lose if it can't make it big here because a lot of voice search will probably happen through these assistants going forward. But it also has an advantage, i.e., all the information it has curated over the years, your preferences and your habits that it can draw from to serve you. In short, it knows you better.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus|Alphabet Inc. QuoteApple Also in the FrayApple doesn't have a separate Home device, but a useful app of the same name that can connect all the smart devices in your home and get them to communicate with each other. So it's also dependent on the number of gadget makers supporting the app and this number has been swelling in the recent past.While Apple's partners aren't making the news as much as the other two, there are a host of switch, light, camera, sensor, security system and other such device makers that have been announcing their support for Apple's platform the last couple of CESs (Apple makes it a point to stay away from the show).Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteSamsung Taking NoticeSamsung paid a cool $8 billion to acquire auto infotainment, acoustics, display and other systems supplier Harman. That is a big sum to pay, although justified considering that Harman does offer a number of products that would be complementary with the displays and chips that are an important part of the increasingly electronic and soon-to-be self-driving cars. IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow from $42 billion in 2016 to $61 billion next year.But there's more: just last year, Harman announced a number of collaborations indicating its growing importance in the world of voice activated controls. In September, it agreed to incorporate Baidu speech recognition and synthesis technology in smart speakers so people can use voice commands to turn on audio experiences and access on-demand services.Earlier, the two collaborated to create CarLife offering advanced Internet capabilities, entertainment features and location-based services on HARMAN's in-vehicle infotainment head units for the Chinese market. At the World of Watson conference last October, Harman collaborated with IBM to bring voice activated intelligent assistance based on IoT and cognitive computing to hotels, offices and hospitals across the world.Along Comes SoundHoundKeyvan Mohajer of SoundHound says, ""We are at the inflection point of our long-term vision that every product or service needs to have a smart voice-enabled interface, and consumers have increasingly high expectations for this requirement, beyond simple commands or skills,"" said Mohajer.He may be right because of the $115 million raised in its 10-year long life, $75 million was contributed just last week from a group of companies including NVIDIA, Samsung's Catalyst Fund, Nomura Holdings, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Recruit Holdings' RSI Fund, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, SharesPost 100 Fund and MKaNN. Global Catalyst Partners, Walden Venture Capital and Translink Capital Partners participated for a second time.The reason the investment is significant at this juncture is SoundHound's voice interface technology called Houndify that will now be empowered to reach more users. Houndify was incorporated into more than 500 products within the first 12 months of launch.Its popularity in the past and why companies like Samsung and NVIDIA are interested in it right now is simple. The technology is not designed to take over the device or transfer data to SoundHound unlike platforms like Alexa and Google Home. So its proliferation will let device makers employ the technology and also retain user data. Houndify already has 20K developers working on the platform and this number could expand rapidly with the cash infusion. Houndify already hasSumming UpInteraction with machines is set to become more interesting than ever before as they gradually understand our needs to get things done the way we want it even before we tell them to or perhaps right after. Since this is a nascent market, there may not be any clear winners. Right now it does look as if there's enough growth opportunity for all the above players and more.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Are These 3 Dividend Stocks Too Cheap to Buy?;2/9/2017;"Income seekers get paid to invest when they buy into   dividend-paying stocks. Who wouldn't want that? Getting a good   deal on a stock's price simply adds to the value that accrues   from searching out cheap stocks that reward shareholders with   healthy payouts.But there might be times when there's too much of a good thing   -- a dividend stock that's so cheap it may be a trap. Consider,   for example,Barnes & Noble(NYSE: BKS) ,Bed Bath & Beyond(NASDAQ: BBBY) , andGameStop(NYSE: GME) . They all pay dividends, and the market is broadly   discounting them, but investors might want to think twice before   buying in. Read on to see why.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Barnes & NobleOn the surface, picking up shares of Barnes & Noble   doesn't seem like such a bad idea. Trading at around $10 a share,   the bookseller's $0.60 annual dividend currently yields a hefty   6%, and though its payout ratio stands at an astronomical 300%   based on earnings, viewed through the lens of the free cash flow   it produces, it's a much more reasonable 49%. Yet anyone who   knows even the slightest thing about the book market understands   that Barnes & Noble is operating on unstable ground.In its fiscal second quarter, the bookseller said sales fell   4% to $858.8 million, as comparable-store sales fell 3.2% because   of lower customer traffic, which pretty much explains the   industry as a whole.Even though the book industry is growing (surprise!), the   buying of books continues to move online, which remains the top   sales channel for publishers' revenue in the trade category.   According to the Association of American Publishers, online   holds a 37.4% share of the market. It also says there is a   return to hardcover books as consumers move away from e-books,   which peaked in 2013 but have since fallen away and now comprise   around 17% of the market.Barnes & Noble was famously upended byAmazon.com, which also caused the demise of Borders, and its enterprise   value now trades at just 9.8 times its free cash flow, a   bargain-basement price. But with a business model standing on   shaky ground that may be risky for its earnings growth, such a   high payout for the dividend it pays makes it a risky read.Image source: Bed Bath & Beyond.Bed Bath & BeyondHome-goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond has an even more   heavily discounted EV/FCF ratio of just 7.8, but like the book   business, its home-furnishings business is also being displaced   by the online market. And where Barnes & Noble at least had   tried to respond by getting into the e-reader business, Bed Bath   & Beyond largely neglected e-commerce until relatively   recently. Now it's in hurry-up mode to make up for lost time,   plowing significant resources into the effort and going on a   shopping spree.Last June, it purchased dying flash-sale site One Kings Lane,   and in November it bought PersonalizationMall.com, a seller of   individually personalized gift items. These aren't particularly   material purchases, but they're not big sales winners, either.   And though its digital customer-facing channels grew 20% in the   third quarter, the gains weren't nearly enough to offset the   declines in its brick-and-mortar locations.Management says its earnings have been trapped in a moribund   range of around $4.50 to $5.00 per share for several years now   because of investments made in the business, and cash balances   that routinely ran north of $1 billion now total less than half   of that amount.It's also having trouble luring customers into its stores, as   itsprodigious couponing effortsno longer generate the same response they once did. Instead, they   only weigh on earnings. It is still able to generate significant   amounts of free cash flow, but an investor might have to wait a   long time before the business turns around, if ever. Its dividend   payment is new, having just been initiated last year, and it   yields just 0.3% -- suggesting it might not be worth the effort   to invest in the stock simply for its payout.GameStopVideo-game retailer GameStop suffered a disappointing   Christmas season, as sales tumbled 16% from the year-ago period   while comparable sales plunged almost 19% on weak sales of once   strong titles such asCall of DutyandTitanfall. As with everyone else on this list, its in-store traffic   fell.The gaming console market is in a state of flux as it   transitions to a digital distribution format. The transition is   obviously hurting sales of physical games, but it's also   affecting the trade-in market. GameStop's response has been to   enter into the mobile-phone and collectibles market, and though   revenue in the segment grew better than 37% in the last quarter,   it still accounts for less than 6% of revenue. And so many   troubled retailers -- RadioShack, anyone? -- have placed their   hopes on having cell phones save them, only to be sorely   disappointed.GameStop is another retailer that's still able to produce   handfuls of free cash flow, generating $451 million worth over   the last 12 months, which means its enterprise value is at a   minuscule 6.5. A $1.48 annual dividend yielding 6.1%, and an   earnings-based payout ratio of 39% (34% based on free cash flow),   make it tempting to take a bite here just to play along.However, with GameStop's main game business moving away from   it even as it operates a large footprint of 7,600 stores, all   while it's betting on new revenue streams that have nothing to do   with its area of expertise, investors would do better looking   elsewhere for a dividend-paying stock.10 stocks we like better than Bed Bath and   BeyondWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI) and Agilent Technologies Inc (A);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheDow Jones Industrial Averageand other benchmarks are breaking out this morning on relatively strong trading. A check of our breakout stocks list brought some familiar names to our attention that deserve a closer look.makeArticleAd();Shares ofAgilent Technologies Inc(NYSE:A),Darden Restaurants, Inc.(NYSE:DRI) andCostco Wholesale Corporation(NASDAQ:COST) are among the names helping to drive the strong performance today as each of these companies are making moves above key trendline or consolidation levels. These breaks suggest that higher prices await as traders begin to chase these trends higher.Agilent Technologies Inc (A)The healthcare sector has been quiet as traders await any ideas on how the regulatory environment and Obamacare may change with the new Trump administration. Agilent set itself outside of the crowd today as the stock broke through technical resistance and into a volatility rally.A shares are moving above $50 today as the company's earnings announcement approaches next week. It appears that the market is ""buying the rumor on Agilent beating expectations. Something it has done each quarter since May 2015.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenEven better, A has been showing revenue growth as the rest of the market has been seeing flagging sales. This puts Agilent in a better light than its peers.The break above $50 is key as it marks the first time A shares have been above this price since 2001.Today's move breaks Agilent above its top Bollinger Band ahead of next week's earnings, something that is likely to continue as volatility rallies higher right up to the announcement. A shares are heading into a slightly overbought condition, which makes the ""trade"" relatively clear.The charts should take Agilent shares higher through mid-week trading after the announcement, then traders should watch for a ""sell the news"" rally to follow and likely end shares back down at $50, where they will find consolidation support before continuing higher.Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)Another company seeing a breakout today is Costco. The retailer pulled back prior to the holiday season and traded range-bound; however, COST shares have been leading the retail sector since December as they continue a climb.Today, Costco broke above $170 on no news. In addition, the COST's earnings aren't expected until the beginning of March. This means the breakout for Costco is trading driven - something we love to see.The break above $170 is coming with volatility as COST shares have now broken above their top Bollinger Band. This indicates that we should expect volume and volatility to increase as Costco stock makes its way higher.How much higher is hard to say as COST shares are now breaking into new all-time high territory. What will help Costco is the fact that the stock saw a 6% increase in short interest in the last reporting period. This indicates that there were traders expecting to see COST stock get rejected at its highs.  Now, these traders must correct their short bets by buying the stock back, helping to drive prices higher.For now, keep eyes on round-numbers as these will be the first targets that traders will act on. Based on that, $180 (a 6% move) is a clear upside target for Costco.Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI)One final breakout for the day is Darden Restaurants. DRI, the proprietor of Olive Garden, among other eateries, is making a technical move above its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking below this key trendline on Jan. 6.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkThe break above the 50-day moving average comes during, you guessed it, a break above Darden stock's Bollinger Band. This suggests that we are likely to see an increase in the upside volatility of DRI Stock.The last time that we saw a similar combination of Darden breaking above the 50-day and a top Bollinger Band was in November 2016. This pattern was ahead of a strong rally in DRI shares that took them from $62 to above $75.For now, watch for some resistance to come in on Darden shares as they trade to $80, as this marks the stock's all-time highs.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), Darden Restaurants, Inc.

In comparison, theS&P 500as a whole trades at about 17x next year's earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn other words, AMZN stock trades at a multiplenearly six timesthat of the average large-cap U.S. stock.Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon: For years, investors have considered Amazon stock overvalued based on a P/E ratio that has often been in the triple digits - and, not all that long ago, negative.Yet AMZN stock seems to defy gravity: Shares are up 50% over the past year, 110% over the past three years and a stunning 340% over the past five years. The reason is that Amazon isn't a stock that should be valued solely on next year's earnings, or the price investors are paying for those earnings. That's not because the market is crazy when it comes to AMZN stock and it's not because the fundamentals ""don't matter"". It's because Amazon is investing now for growth later - and that's exactly what itshouldbe doing.AMZN's Earnings Aren't the Only ThingIt's tempting to think that a stock with a lower P/E ratio is by definition ""cheaper"" than other stocks. Why would an investor pay 50x, or 100x, a year's earnings when he or she could pay 15x, or 10x? Growth certainly matters.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendIntuitively, an investor understands that 18x earnings for a bad business isn't obviously better than, say, 22x earnings for a good business. In fact, it may be worse. But the P/E ratio for Amazon stock seems ridiculous on its face. AMZN is already the biggest retailer in the world; is it really going to show so much growth that it's worth paying a 100x P/E? It would have to grow its profits by a factor of five just to get the multiple to 20x, which doesn't sound cheap itself.However, that type of analysis is generally too simplistic. A stock is valued based on the sum ofallits future cash flows - not just next year's. That's true for AMZN stock, and it's true forMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) stock as well.The fact that AMZN trades at 62x 2017 earnings and M trades at 10x doesn't, in and of itself, prove anything. It seems almost certain that the earnings and cash flow attributed to AMZN stock will continue to rise; it seems highly likely that Macy's earnings will, in contrast, fall. The rates at which those earnings rise or decline matters, of course, and those rates inform how investors value AMZN stock or M stock.But whether a stock is valued at 100x P/E or 3x P/E, investors need to take a long-term outlook. And while it may not appear like it at first glance, that's exactly what many AMZN stock holders are doing.The Two Ways For Amazon Stock to Grow EarningsEven those investors who are mostly bearish on Amazon stock would likely admit that Amazon's earnings will continue to grow going forward. But the bearish argument - one that has been made for the better part of a decade - is that it's almost impossible for AMZN earnings to growthat much. After all, as a company gets bigger, its growth rate fades, simply due to its size. (SeeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for a perfect example.)At some point, the optimism that keeps Amazon stock at nosebleed levels will fade - and AMZN stock will come back to Earth.But that argument assumes that Amazon is at nosebleed levels, which may not be the case. The heavy-handed P/E ratio sounds highly stretched; however, according to AMZN's most recent 10-Q, it generated $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That implies a sub-50x multiple to free cash flow ona trailing basis -a slightly less intimidating multiple. And the focus on P/E ratio also ignores that there are two ways for Amazon to grow earnings.The first is the standard way that companies grow earnings: higher sales and better margins. There's little reason, barring an economic recession, to see AMZN's sales declining. Even then, increased market share could allow Amazon to post revenue growth, if not at the 29% pace seen through the first three quarters of 2016.There's also reason to see AMZN's margins expand considerably. Somewhat incredibly, on a GAAP basis, Amazon's operating margin year-to-date is just 3.2%. Yet the company has built out an incredible distribution platform and it has invested billions of dollars in its Amazon Web Services business. Incremental sales thus should boost margins considerably; it takes very little in the way of investment to sell a few more items, or add another cloud customer.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAMZN still has years of benefits from the scale it has built out, and those benefits will continue to expand margins for some time, allowing for steady, and even explosive earnings and cash flow growth.The second issue relative to current and 2017 earnings is that Amazon isn't currently maximizing its profits. Rather, it is spending - sometimes wildly - on a variety of initiatives, offering everything from restaurant delivery to photo printing to Prime Video and Prime Music subscriptions.Some of those efforts will work; many likely will fail. But looking at 2016 and 2017 earnings and not considering the impact of that spending is as short-term as buying AMZN stock in 2017 simply because it rose in 2016. Amazon's operating expenses are on pace to increase almost $10 billion year-over-year in 2016. A good chunk of that is coming from hiring employees, marketing the new businesses and creating the distribution platforms for various projects.Assume, then, that AMZN decided to focus on near-term earnings, instead of investing now for the future. Simply limiting that increase to $5 billion would come close todoublingAmazon's earnings and cash flow next year. Ignoring that new spend ignores the 'true' earnings power of AMZN stock.Bottom Line on AMZN Stock: It's ComplicatedThis is not to say that Amazon stock is necessarily a buy. As a value investor myself, I still question the valuation of AMZN stock in my own way. But simply checking the P/E ratio for AMZN - or any other stock - is too simplistic. Trying to value Amazon stock is a messy, difficult, detailed endeavor. The Amazon Web Services business is vastly different from the price-sensitive, low-margin, online retail business. It's not clear how much AMZN is spending on its new projects, and how much it could save.It's complicated. But so is investing the right way. And simply ignoring - or shorting - Amazon stock because of its P/E ratio isn't the right way to do it. There are reasons to be optimistic, and pessimistic, toward AMZN stock, but those reasons go well beyond a single number.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe postAmazon.com Inc.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA): A Thief, Or a Cave of Riches?;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe original story of Alibaba, which is not in the original1001 Nights, tells of a poor man finding 40 thieves' riches in a cave and bringing them into the light of day.

He is using all his Forrest Gump-like charm to head one off, and doing the Lord's work in that.No one has more to lose in such a war than Ma, and his shareholders.Grabbing Alibab With Both HandsWhile most analysis of Alibaba is focused on itsbusiness within China, management is focused on breaking out of China and into Australia, India and (through its film and TV unit) into the U.S. as well.Alibaba is based on what is, once again, a revolutionary idea thatgreater communicationand trade can lead to global understanding, prosperity and peace.I say it's ""once again"" revolutionary because it runs counter to global political trends in which ultra-nationalists are seizing power, pushing down criticism and seeking to make war on one another.

Their economies are growing, their people entering the global middle class. Birth rates are declining, people are being educated, and extreme poverty is receding.Untold Riches EverywhereAs people emerge from real poverty, a poverty even poor Americans can't comprehend, they gain a stake in stability because they have something to lose.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers;2/9/2017;"One of the many interesting details revealed inSnap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion   contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with   relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been   spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's   slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its   existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google   Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs   increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.Image Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google's cloud service competes against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch   up to the competition.What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It   lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item,   which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the   three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play   likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as   of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract   likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.While Google has made several advancements in its cloud   services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft   boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but   Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in   just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run   rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion   in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter   alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.Google still needs to diversifyThe growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud   services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away   from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of   cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has   helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but   there's still more work to do.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar   Pichai said, ""We have truly differentiated offerings in four key   areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy,   tools for application development, and the ability to create   connected business platforms."" Snap can take advantage of at   least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was   willing to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants   to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it   could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its   own servers.Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data   centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing,   management notes, ""In the future, we may invest in building our   own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last   few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own   cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud   costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can   postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to   spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount   for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last   year.It also means that switching service providers will be   difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract   as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google   Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics   of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years   even costlier.On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue   growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled   by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely   put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of   capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any   indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340   million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google   ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make   the most of its spend.Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the   company to Google for a long time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.60 per contract. The 12% buffer from the current price gives me an 85% theoretical chance of success. I purposely took this trade at a much more aggressive level than my usual set ups because I come into it with profits in hand already.If AMZN stock stays above $715 per share this year, my reward here would be over 40% yield on money risked.Usually I like to hedge my trades by selling bearish risks, but in this momentum runner, I fear I could be starting a potential problem. So for now, I will hold the trade as-is knowing I will manage the risk appropriately should prices come under fire.I consider it a blessing that AMZN options offer me a cheap way to go long this high-priced ticker.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock enjoyed healthy gains in the days following the company's earnings reports, and analystscrooned over the results.makeArticleAd();But not everyone was so thrilled, with some pointing out the fact that the December quarter had an extra week and others focusing on the challenges being seen in the smartphone market.Nonetheless, analysts are as happy as can be and continue to try to sell investors on the iPhone 8 cycle. At least one analyst has boosted his price target for AAPL stock based on the record iPhone unit number in the December quarter.AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per ShareCanaccord Genuityanalyst T. Michael Walkley raised his price target for Apple stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note dated Feb. 6. He feels the company took a ""strong share"" of the premium end of the world's smartphone market during the December quarter, as it generated 92% of profits.That is a decline from 106% of the profits in the September quarter, however, becauseSAMSUNG ELECTRONIC's (SSNLF) profits improved after the Galaxy Note 7 recall.Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones with an average selling price of $695 during its first fiscal quarter as consumers preferred the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models. Walkley also believes the iPhone maker benefited from the Note 7 recall-although there was some debate about that before the results were released. Apple management said the quarter had the highest quarterly number of switchers from Android, something that third-party data indicated just before the release.The analyst also expects the iPhone 7 lineup to continue doing well, bridging the gap until the iPhone 8 is released, probably in September.Despite Walkley's (and almost everyone else's) enthusiasm about Apple stock, Neil George, a contributor forThe Street,feels investors are doing nothing more but attending the ""church of Apple.""Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200InvestorsdumpedAmazon.con, Inc.(AMZN) stock immediately following the retailer's earnings results (although the shares are up today), but they have been happily slurping up Apple stock.He said the iPhone maker ""is faced with a dwindling market share and shrinking margins,"" which means it just doesn't make sense to be so enamored with the company.Meanwhile, Amazon recorded soaring revenues and the seventh consecutive profitable quarter. There's also new data from Slice Intelligence indicating that the company hoards 53% of all growth in U.S. online sales.Did Apple Take Investors For a Ride?George argues that Apple ""pulled off a sleight of hand"" by adding the extra week in the December quarter-an argument also made by Thomas H. Kee Jr. onMarketWatch. According to Kee, to make up for that extra week, the company would have had to report about $3.53 per share in earnings rather than the $3.38 per share it reported.He also estimates that revenue should have been about $81 billion rather than the $78.4 billion that was reported. Based on his weekly calculations, the company grew at a 4.11% slower rate in the most recent December quarter than it did in the same quarter in 2015. Kee argued that Apple's growth rate contracted rather than grew in the most recently completed quarter and that it only looks like it did because of that extra week.George highlighted other ""problems"" he sees at Apple as well, like the contracted gross margin, which fell to 38.5% from 40.1% in the year-ago period. The iPhone maker also saw its sales in China, the world's biggest market, fall 12% in the December quarter, reducing its market share there to 9.6%. He said the company's global market share has fallen as well, down to 11.5%.Apple  is widely expected to launch the tenth anniversary edition of its smartphone under the iPhone 8 moniker, and most firms have been calling this cycle a ""supercycle"" because they're expecting tremendous growth.However, one analyst that's been calling for a supercycle is starting to back off from that theory and suggests now that the next cycle will be one of ""smooth"" growth rather than anything of the ""super"" variety.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialUBSanalyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note dated Feb. 7 that he's now ""smoothing"" out his assumptions for iPhone growth over the next couple of years and adopting ""less of asupercycleview"" for fiscal 2018."" He noted that it should be expected for product cycles in a maturing market to become muted, so he's cutting his iPhone unit growth estimate from 16% to 12% for fiscal 2018 and boosting his fiscal 2019 estimate from a 2% decline to a 7% increase.Despite this smoothing out, he's still expecting the iPhone 8 cycle to bring greater growth than the fiscal 2019 cycle.He feels that it could be more beneficial for Apple stock's multiple if the company experiences more gradual growth because investors might be encouraged to see the company's hardware and services revenue combined as an annuity.Shares of AAPLstock rose by as much as 0.19% to $131.78 during regular trading hours on Wednesday and are trading slightly higher in early morning trading Thursday.The postApple Inc.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year results to the investment community after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I've been slow to warm to Nvidia's investment appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock has nearly tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe key to the forthcoming earnings release will be growth - just like it is for any company. So far, the earnings momentum and increases in analyst projections suggest Nvidia's prospects are bright.But will NVDA stock holders have to tolerate some bumps along the way?Nvidia Earnings ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in early December, I suggested keeping an eye on earnings trends. At that time, full-year earnings estimates (the average of the earnings all analysts covering the name expect the company to report) had jumped nearly 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It's a key reason NVDA stock has rallied so strongly.The current full-year estimate for Nvidia earnings (according to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relays that 19 analysts have provided estimates. That's about flat over the past 60 days, but actually down slightly from the $2.45 projected 30 days ago.But really, this is splitting hairs. It's very likely NVDA reports a solid quarter in terms of bottom-line growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAnd sales growth is projected to bestellar. Analysts expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-line growth is projected to slow to 16% for full-year sales of nearly $8 billion; 2018 profits are currently pegged at $2.71 per share.The Business Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock sits right below 50. That's a rather lofty multiple, and it essentially means that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickly surging share price could take a similarly speedy tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia operates in some of the most exciting growth areas for semiconductors. The company is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular its graphic processing units, or GPUs. The company boasts it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. This looks accurate - a recentBarron'sarticlepegged its GPU market share at 68%. This is one of the most compelling spaces in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia's chips are an integral component in the ecosystems that are pioneering growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machine learning, and self-driving cars. These are some hugely disruptive industries that could end up revolutionizing many facets of the gaming, computing, and automotive industries.The company's gaming business is the largest operating unit and growing 30% per year on average since 2013. Its data center business (to support cloud computing) is expanding at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automotive is skyrocketing 75% annually, though from a very small initial base.In some respects, and provided you are comfortable with the lofty valuation, Nvidia is a very compelling way for broad exposure to multiple disruptive industries.NVDA adds exposure to the cloud-computing excitement that is creating a buzz at giant tech firms includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole position in the autonomous automobile charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 computing platform currently powers the Tesla auto models that already have self-driving capabilities.The CompetitionMore direct competitors includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are looking to grow in these newer markets. Both key rivals are also likely to benefit from GPUs used to power gaming systems, machine learning, and servers used for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from its dominant market share in personal computing. Its 80% market share to power personal computers and related devices has literally resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in cash flow over the past several decades. This gives it unmatched rivalry to invest in new technology and keep a leadership position over chip competitors. But computing is mature and barely expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost its way. Years of mismanagement allowed Intel to expand on its dominance and nearly put AMD out of business. But new management appears to have reinvigorated AMD, and investors are starting to believe it can also benefit from the same markets Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arecent interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni pegged semiconductor stocks as one of his favorite industries for 2017. In his words, ""we're talking about major secular disruptions in autos, consumer electronics, and gaming."" Chips that power data warehouses to serve the rise in cloud computing represent yet another market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor's best bet to gain exposure to these markets. The rub, of course, is its valuation already reflects many more years of rapid growth.AMD is an interesting turnaround play, though with its current low levels of profitability, the trading multiples are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. Its forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest taking a wait-and-see approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is likely to impress, but given the lofty valuation, any hiccup in the expectations could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."
What Is Unearned Revenue, and Why Should Amazon Investors Care About It?;2/9/2017;"A small line item onAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balance sheet has been growing rapidly over the   past couple years. Since the end of 2014, Amazon's unearned   revenue liability increased from $1.8 billion to $4.8   billion. Some investors might see a growing liability and   think that's bad news, but in fact this is very good news.Unearned revenue is simply cash customers have paid to Amazon   in advance for services it has yet to render. For example, Prime   members typically pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day   shipping program. Amazon immediately takes the cash and puts it   on its balance sheet, but it amortizes the $99 of revenue over   the 12 months of the membership. So it accounts for only $8.25   per month in revenue per month for each Prime member. The rest of   the cash received for Prime is held in the unearned-revenue   balance.Prime growth has been very good over the past few years.   Amazon says it added ""tens of millions"" of new members last year.   But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearned revenue. More   likely, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest factor pushing   the balance higher.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Maybe last quarter wasn't so disappointingFor the first time since Amazon started breaking out AWS   revenue and income, the cloud-computing segment missed analysts'   expectations. Sales totaled $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter,   where analysts were expecting $3.6 billion on average.But unearned revenue climbed $568 million from the previous   quarter. That's unusual for Amazon's fourth quarter. Usually,   unearned revenue spikes in the first quarter as cloud customers   presumably re-up short-term contracts for the year.Most of Amazon's AWS customers are small businesses using its   pay-as-you-go pricing, which allows them to quickly scale their   use. The solution works well for companies with small or   unpredictable user bases.But a lot of AWS's money comes from the big enterprises that   spend hundreds of millions every year on cloud computing. For   those companies, with more predictable usage needs, Amazon offers   ""reserved instances,"" which offers a discount if customers pay up   front. Growth in reserved instances, or other long-term   contracts, may have resulted in lower revenue in the short term,   but it nearly guaranteed revenue in the future.Locking in customersAs the competition for cloud-computing infrastructure   continues to heat up, long-term contracts may prove invaluable.   Locking in customers for a relatively long term means those   enterprises will start optimizing their code so that it runs more   efficiently on the specific hardware and platform they're   using.Such is the case withSnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which uses Google's cloud. In its S-1 filing, Snap   says it built its app to use ""services provided by Google, some   of which do not have an alternative in the market,"" asRe/Code'sPeter Guagenti points out. Not only did Snap just agree to a $2   billion five-year contract with Google, but it's also going to be   hard for it to leave Google even after the five years is up.   That's excellent news forAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excellent   for Snap investors.Ultimately, signing long-term contracts provides a moat   against the growing competition. Not only does it lock in   customers for the length of the contract, but it could also lock   them in longer if they become dependent on certain features of a   cloud platform. In that light, Amazon's fourth-quarter AWS   results look quite strong.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

The 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stocks Today;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe classic ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy advises buying the 10 highest-yieldingDow Jones Industrial Averagestocks, then holding onto them for a year. The idea is that higher yields are a signal of a beaten-up share price - and that because we're buying a stable blue-chip with a stable customer base, investors will eventually bid the stock back up when the business cycle turns up again.makeArticleAd();But we can further improve on this effective yet somewhat ""dumb"" strategy with a bit of second-level analysis.After all, some of these companies have business models that are actually aging in dog years!And they should be avoided.Today we're going to discuss four high paying Dow dividend stock components. Two are compelling buys, while two should be sold immediately (or even shorted).12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenLet's get started…WINNER: Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)Dividend Yield:3.6%Exxon Mobil Corporation(XOM) is emerging from what easily has been one of the most trying points in the company's history, the roots of which stretch all the way back to 1870.From about mid-2014 through the start of 2016, oil prices plunged from near $110 down to below $30 - a collapse that caused energy stocks across the sector to careen into the ground, and forced numerous companies to shut their doors.Even Exxon Mobil - America's biggest energy company by market capitalization, and one of the world's largest and most diversified oil and gas operations - wasn't immune. Shares dipped from around $105 to around $72 or so - a 30%-plus dip in just more than a year's time, which is virtually unheard of in blue chips as well-established as XOM. Pundits thought that Exxon's streak of dividend increases, which spanned more than three decades, was in jeopardy.However, former CEO Rex Tillerson himself managed the company in such a way that he knew its operations could survive with oil prices as low as $40 per barrel. April 2016 came around, and XOM maintained its status as a Dividend Aristocrat with a small but symbolic payout hike. Meanwhile, XOM shares have clawed back at least some of their losses.Speaking of Tillerson …The former Exxon CEO is a ""former"" chief because he's now America's Secretary of State. That's no doubt a boon to XOM, especially considering the Trump administration's seemingly favorable and cooperative view with Russia - where Exxon has huge energy interests and projects, and where Tillerson himself has deep ties.Moreover, President Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress are proving extremely friendly to the energy sector as a whole right now, most recently with a Senate vote to knock down a rule governing transparency on energy firms' payments to foreign governments.Exxon was already set up well to benefit from an eventual return to high oil prices, and now it's seemingly in the driver's seat. While investors wait for those gains to take hold, they can enjoy 3.6% in dividends from this relentless oil titan.Exxon (XOM): This Long-Time Winner Is in Recovery ModeLOSER: Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT)Dividend Yield:3%Wal-Mart Stores Inc(WMT) is one of the perfect examples of how a big, solid blue-chip can still be a big, solid dud.Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, and in fact Earth's biggest company by revenue, boasting more than 11,000 stores across 28 countries. BeforeAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) came around, Walmart was considered one of the biggest disruptors to traditional brick-and-mortar retail. Its bargain-basement prices and enormous product offerings upended countless mom 'n' pop shops, but also put the hurt to larger specialty retailers such asBest Buy Co Inc(BBY) andhhgregg, Inc.(HGG).But Amazondidcome along, and that - along with Walmart's ubiquity and lack of options for expansion - are at the very least keeping Walmart from being the investment powerhouse it once was.While WMT does produce world-class revenues, top-line growth has been thinning for years, and in 2016, Walmart's sales actually dropped year-over-year:Walmart has been spending for years trying to bring its online offerings up to par to battle Amazon's unstoppable e-commerce machine - yet it just keeps falling farther behind. Dividend growth is lagging too - last year management upped its payout by a meager 2%.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryWMT has lagged the total returns of the S&P 500 for the last 15 years - it's time to cut this dead weight loose.WINNER: Boeing Co (BA)Dividend Yield:3.5%Boeing Co(BA) just boosted its dividend by 30% to $1.42 per share - more than double its quarterly payout from 2013! And Boeing's generosity to shareholders didn't stop there.The company also upgraded its old stock repurchase program by implementing a new $14 billion buyback plan.Future business prospects are looking good. Boeing said it expects 2017 commercial aircraft deliveries to reach between 760 and 765, up from last year's 748.Core earnings are expected to surge from $7.24 per share to a range of $9.10 to $9.30 per share.And Boeing sees cash flow ticking up from $10.5 billion last year to $10.75 billion in 2017 - plenty of cash to dish back to shareholders.Boeing's (BA) Dividend Takes OffLOSER: International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)Dividend Yield:3.2%Nineteen straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines - 'nuff said.International Business Machines Corp.'s (IBM) core businesses, such as services and software licenses, have declined on a year-over-year basis for 19 straight quarters. And it's a bad sign that the company still won't break out its Watson revenues, despite the fact IBM says its promising artificial intelligence unit is growing briskly.IBM's 2016 dividend hike dipped into single digits after years of double-digit improvements. Cash and short-term investments have dipped from about $11 billion in 2013 to $8.5 billion as of its last report … and long-term debt has climbed from $32.9 billion to $34.7 billion in that same time.And that streak of consecutive revenue declines?If Wall Street is right, it'll be extended at least by a couple more quarters, and both 2017 and 2018 revenues are seen eroding, not recovering.IBM might survive for an eternity, but it won't grow your money for you.IBM (IBM) Revenues Just Keep SinkingThe Best 7% Dividends for 2017Every portfolio has room for Dow Jones stalwarts like Boeing and Exxon Mobil that will throw off serious dividends and actually help grow your nest egg in the process.But Boeing and especially Exxon Mobil could see some significant moves in either direction depending on how the winds in Washington blow over the next few years. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to have to check CNN headlines and Donald Trump's Twitter account every single day just to make sure my retirement holdings are still in the clear.That's why my latest stock research has been focused on a 1-2 punch of high yields and all-weather performance.I've just put together a newFREEreport, ""The Best 7% Dividends for 2017,"" that features bulletproof yields of 7%, 8% … even double digits. Yes, we need big yields to make it to the retirement finish line comfortably intact, but we also need stocks that can go on the offensive when bull markets take hold, yet also won't shiver at the first sniff of macroeconomic uncertainty.The Federal Reserve could throw three interest-rate hikes at us this year, or it could do what it did the past two years and deliver just one rate hike. Donald Trump could justify the big sector moves from the past couple of months by delivering on his campaign promises … or Washington could deliver a bunch of compromises that temper the bulls' expectations. China could rattle more sabers in the South China Sea. The Brexit could take a more definite shape and send international investors into a panic once more.10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyWith these top dividend picks,you don't have to worry about any of that!The only thing you'll need to worry about is how you're going to enjoy your retirement.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improve your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it has been lethal for investors. During the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrendous 60%. This is certainly another case study of how high-profile IPOs can quickly come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a value play here?As I've written various times for InvestorPlace, it's probably not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a company that develops a product that really is not a must-have. According to a recent study fromGartner, the abandonment rate on fitness trackers is 30%. The most common reasons for this include: users either get bored or the device breaks!The conclusion from the report: ""Dropout from device usage is a serious problem for the industry. The abandonment rate is quite high relative to the usage rate. To offer a compelling enough value proposition, the uses for wearable devices need to be distinct from what smartphones typically provide. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.""The Other Problems for FIT StockBut this is definitely not the only major issue with Fitbit stock. Let's face it, the competitive environment remains intense. The company must fight against tough rivals likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch, which is still in the early phases.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterIn light of all this, is it any wonder that Wall Street is concerned with FIT stock? Of course not.More importantly, the company is already reporting major problems, as seen with the latest warning on fourth-quarter earnings. Fitbit's guidance calls for a loss of 51 cents to 56 cents a share on revenues of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast was for earnings of 14 cents to 18 cents a share and revenues of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it looks like the holiday season turned out to be a disaster for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situation isexpected to continue. The full-year prediction is for revenues of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cents to 44 cents a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-line and profits of 64 cents a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT has a plan that looks weak. The company expects to reduce the workforce by mere 6% and to take other vague efforts to reduce operating costs, leverage data and launch products into new categories. Interesting enough, Fitbit wants to focus more on the smartwatch market, but this will likely mean more expenses.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO James Parksaidthat the issues with the company were ""temporary"" and the ""performance is not reflective of the value of our brand, market-leading platform, and company's long-term potential.""Huh? Well, this really does seem like the talk of someone who is out-of-touch. And this should definitely be ominous for holders of FIT stock.Granted, perhaps there may be a buyout. But when it comes to broken hardware companies, this may be wishful thinking. For example, think about how long the rumors for a purchase of the beleagueredBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be very interesting to a suitor. And this is not because the products are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simple as that the market has hit maturation levels and that big players like AAPL stand to capture a big part of what's available.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Zacks Podcast Highlights: Wide Moat Investing: The Best Way to Find Great Long Term Stocks?;2/9/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - In this edition of the Dutram Report, we investigate the world of wide moat companies. These firms have durable competitive advantages which may make them top notch picks for investors over the long haul. To learn more about this concept, we speak with Brandon Rakszawski, a product manager at VanEck, who gives us his insights on the topic. To listen to the podcast, click here: (https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/243925/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-for-long-term-investments )When you are looking for a great selection for your long term portfolio, you want a stock that is in a great competitive position, and one that looks to see these advantages hold over years, if not decades. But how do you find a company that is going to stand the test of time?One way to find these companies is by looking at those with 'wide moats'. This concept seeks companies that have a long term, durable competitive advantage that can protect a firm's position over the coming years. Think of a castle with a wide moat surrounding it. The wider the moat, the tougher it will be to break into the castle, and that is exactly what this approach is looking for in the corporate world too.Where Are These Companies?To find these companies, I spoke with Brandon Rakszawski of VanEck for some insights. Brandon is the product manager at VanEck, an ETF provider that has the VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETFMOATand the VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETFMOTIin its lineup, so he is definitely familiar with the concept.We discuss the idea of wide moats in a bit more detail, and we also talk about the index construction of these products which focus on wide moat ratings from Morningstar, in addition to trading at big discounts to fair value.We also talk about some of the major types of wide moats out there and how these can help give companies durable competitive advantages over time, and what investors need to look for when analyzing a stock's prospects.I also asked Brandon for a few examples of how this in terms of the funds' holdings, and he noted how Tiffany & CoTIFwith its excellent brand name is a great case, as well as MastercardMAwith its incredible network. Additionally, investors should note a few other top-notch examples from the current holdings list, including AmazonAMZNwhich is well-known for its ultra-low cost model, as well as Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, which is a Mexican company that owns more than a dozen airports, giving it basically a monopoly over air travel in many areas of that country.We also discuss how this approach might result in some sector biases, and some key factors that investors need to know about this approach. I also talk to Brandon about some of the companies out there that have no moat at all-and thus little to no competitive advantage-and what investors can take away from these companies too.Bottom LineThis was a great chat on what makes a 'wide moat' company, and it could give investors something to look for in terms of 2017 picks too. So, make sure to listen to this edition of the Dutram Report for a closer look at this often-overlooked, but potentially lucrative, segment of the equity world.

Snap, Inc. Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work?;2/8/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be leading the growing market for cloud   infrastructure, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still putting up a fight.Cloud infrastructure vendors have been crucial in enabling   smaller start-ups, particularly those that are building mobile   apps, to get up and running without having to worry as much about   the back end. It's an appealing model since it allows smaller   companies to simply pay for what they need without having to   invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words,   it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, andGoogle is betting bigthat the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major   way in the years ahead.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their   own cloud infrastructure. This gives them much more control over   their own destinies, reduces risk, and over time the cost   efficiencies improve after the large upfront investment.Social media peersFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andTwitterboth operate their own data centers; Facebook announced itsseventh data centera few months back, while Twitter's infrastructure operations are   expanding more slowly, as it operates in co-located facilities.   Data centers are so strategically important to Facebook that it   helped create the Open Compute Project back in 2011, publicly   sharing Facebook's infrastructure innovations for the greater   good.But notSnap(NYSE: SNAP) .Hey, big spenderSnap primarily relies on Google Cloud for its infrastructure   needs. While this is entirely par for the course for mobile app   start-ups, Snap has grown to a size (nearly 160 million daily   active users) that would typically warrant investing in   infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap's use of Google Cloud is   what's unprecedented here. The Information reports that Google   landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap   very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also   uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree.Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked   Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on   Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October   of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap   has longer-term ambitions to build out its own   infrastructure.But for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and   spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the   bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenue   consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure   partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily   include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage   costs."" Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has   committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next   five years.But at what cost?In discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using   a capital-light business model will translate into ""lower costs   for us in both the short and long term."" That's definitely true   in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term.Having a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with   operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs   get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time,   reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost   structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs   will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much   margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of   revenueexceededrevenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross   margin.We saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor   industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" models   that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of   dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract   chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus   more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners   would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip   manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and   innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx   model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that   currently manufacture their own chips these days.Snap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on   third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not   this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows   from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups   and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how   this experiment unfolds.10 stocks we like better than SnapWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Surprise, Surprise: Google, Amazon, Microsoft All Donated to Trump's Inauguration;2/8/2017;"On Tuesday,Politico confirmedthat come of the biggest technology corporations in America donated to President Trump's inauguration last month, the same companies who have recently voiced opposition to the administration's controversial immigration policies.Citing federal ethics documents, as well as sources familiar with the matter,Politicoreported that AmazonAMZN, Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLdivision, and MicrosoftMSFTall donated both cash and services to the president's inauguration back in January. Microsoft, for example, contributed $250,000 in cash, in addition to the same amount in technology and other tools, on December 28 to the Presidential Inaugural Committee.Google apparently provided an unspecified cash donation and a YouTube livestream of the inauguration, while Amazon gave similar services including tech help and an undisclosed donation. FacebookFB, though giving no cash donation, did provide Instagram photo booths and a mini Oval Office for those celebrating.It's quite common for corporations to donate to inaugural committees, regardless of political party affiliation. Microsoft donated about $2 million in cash and services for President Obama's second inauguration, while BoeingBAgave $1 millionto President Trump's inaugural events despite the president's attacks on the airplane maker.Just last December, the top executives of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, as well as CiscoCSCO, IBMIBM, IntelINTC, OracleORCL, and TeslaTSLAmet with President Trump in a so-called tech summit where the group discussed the growing uncertainty over the then president-elect's economic policies and the impact on the tech industry.The meeting seemed to create a sense of peace between the president and the tech executives, especially after a bitter election season, but President Trump's recent executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States upended that concord. On Monday, over 100 tech companies, including many of the above as well as Apple (AAPL) and Twitter (TWTR),told a federal courtthat they ""oppose the president's executive order because it's bad for the country and hurts their ability to attract talent,"" notesPolitico.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Here's Why Grubhub is Slumping After Earnings;2/8/2017;"On Wednesday, shares of online food ordering and delivery serviceGrubhub Inc.GRUBare slumping, down about 2.8% in late-morning trading after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results.Earnings per share of 19 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents per share, and this is the biggest reason for GRUB's drop today. Investors should note this number excludes three cents from non-recurring items. Revenues of $137.5 million matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137 million and increased 38% year-over-year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA came in at $39.2 million, a 46% year-over-year increase from the prior-year period.Among its key business metrics, the Chicago-based company noted that orders, or Daily Average Grubs, grew 21% year-over-year while Active Diners were 8.17 million, a 21% increase from the year-ago period. Gross Food Sales were $818 million, which grew 27% year-over-year.""Grubhub had a transformative year in 2016. We dramatically improved our product and reaccelerated order growth. Fueled by data-driven product enhancements, substantial strides in delivery, and a refreshed marketing approach, we exited the year growing DAGs faster than we did a year ago,"" said Matt Maloney, Grubhub CEO.Grubhub signed Denny'sDENN, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Red Robin Gourmet BurgersRRGB, and Hooters as corporate delivery customers in the fourth quarter, Maloney also said. The company is now operating in 70 markets, a good sign of growth as Grubhub continues to face competition from other companies like Postmates, Uber, and AmazonAMZN.Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, Grubhub expects revenues in the range of $620 million to $660 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $190 million.Currently, GRUB is a #4 (Sell) on the Zacks Rank, and is up 9.81% year-to-date.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Can FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a rough ride forFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) stock. FEYE stock went public in September 2013, priced at $20 per share. FireEye doubled on its first day of trading; it cleared $90 by March. A quick plunge followed, and after a modest rebound, shares have been in a consistent downtrend, falling from above $50 in June 2015 to a current price around $11.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)With FEYE stock now near an all-time low, investors are looking to see if there's a way to salvage some value.FireEye itself has been in the middle of a turnaround, to be sure. The company has cut costs, and worked to shift from legacy hardware products to a more cloud-based model. But the departure of the chairman and CFO after last week's Q4 earnings report could hamper those plans. Already, restructuring has left several key positions open and affected FireEye's sales and marketing efforts.There is a case for the company to be a takeover target, which almost certainly would value FEYE stock above current levels. But investors expecting a deal in the near-term seem likely to be disappointed. FireEye could be of interest to a larger player, but it still has a lot of work to do.What FireEye Needs To DoIt's always tempting to see a M&A opportunity in a growth stock that has fallen on hard times. According to aBloombergreport last year, FireEye already has turned down several buyout offers. Those deals almost certainly would have been struck at a price much higher than $11. Surely, the rumored buyers - among themInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) - would still be interested at a lower price?12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe problem, however, is that FEYE's business looks much worse than it did even six months ago. 2016 as a whole doesn't look that bad, to be sure: Revenue increased 15% over 2015, and the company managed to cut non-GAAP operating expenses by 3% at the same time. That combination moved FireEye closer to profitability: The non-GAAP loss narrowed from $1.61 per share to $0.99 per share.Those numbers don't show the real issue, however. Billings, which reflect revenue added in the quarter - not necessarily recognized sales - increased just 3% for the year. More concerning: That figure became progressively worse as the year went on. In Q1, billings growth was over 20%; in Q3, the figure increased just 4%. Q4 billings then declined 14% and the midpoint of Q1 guidance implies a 25% decrease next quarter.Nothing good will happen for FEYE stock until that trend is reversed. Acquirers don't want to buy a declining business. FireEye is already both unprofitable and burning cash. Declining billings will only worsen its losses. And FEYE can't blame its market. PeerFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) announced 22% billings growth in its first quarter on the same day FEYE stock was plunging after its report. To be even considered as an M&A target with a market cap still over $2 billion, FireEye has to fix its sales problems.Can FEYE Stock Rebound Through M&A?For its part, FireEye management believes those issues will be fixed. After Q4, outgoing CFO Mike Berry said the company would return to growth in the second half of 2017. New cloud-based offerings and the recently rolled out Helix platform are projected to start boosting sales by then.The huge decline in product billings - down 50% in Q4, and guided the same in Q1 - will start to be lapped. And CEO Kevin Mandia pointed out on the Q4 call that FireEye for months had no head of sales, either worldwide or in Europe.Combined with easy comparisons, FEYE expects to get back to billings growth toward the end of this year, which likely would translate into revenue growth in early 2018. But until that happens, it's hard to expect much in the way of M&A interest.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingWhile FireEye seems confident in its prospects, the price of FEYE stock shows that many observers remain skeptical. The company is shifting from products to clouds, but there's a real concern that it's ""too little, too late,"" with rivals like Fortinet andPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) having beaten FireEye to market.Any sale of FEYE is going to depend on that top-line rebound taking place. Lower spend is nice in the near-term, but isn't going to be the primary consideration of a strategic acquirer like IBM or Cisco. A larger company looking to enter the cybersecurity market through a takeout of FireEye stock is going to plan for substantial cost cuts regardless. Whether FEYE makes those cuts in 2017 or IBM does so in 2019 doesn't much change the possibility of a takeover - or the price to be paid for FireEye stock.Simply put, it's revenue that will drive FEYE's attractiveness as an M&A target. Thus, it's revenue that will drive the performance of FireEye stock this year. Sales performance seems to hinge on whether the company succeeds in pivoting away from its legacy appliance business. That puts a lot of pressure on Helix, in particular. The platform may rise to the challenge, to be sure. But any investors expecting a takeout of FEYE stock should at the least, be patient. FireEye has a lot to prove before bigger companies come calling.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Dividend Growth Stocks on Sale TodayThe postCan FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Amazon and Samsung Offerings Could Eat Into Google Search;2/8/2017;"Let me start by stating the obvious:Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is the undisputed   champion of search. With over 60% of the US market and more than   90% of worldwide of worldwide search, Google is ubiquitous   and is not going anywhere any time soon. But even 800-pound   gorillas need to look around the room every now and then and see   what might be coming their way. From the looks of it, two fellow   titans are pushing products that might test Google's   strength.Google is the undisputed king of search. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();Bixby to bypass Google?Samsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image     source :VivLate last year,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence   company whose founders were the original developers ofApple'sSiri. With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of thevirtual personal assistant. With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was   being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play   well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores   fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was   able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex   questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants.   With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as   Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the   soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its   recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps   on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the   camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By   pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the ""Bixby""   button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native   search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item   for purchase.There arepersistent rumorsthat Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the   default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so.   Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair   have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement.Google may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it   would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature   -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object   and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone   never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's   search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's   search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in   light of the the Galaxy Note 7'srecent difficulties.Consumers begin product searches on Amazon.comMore products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image     source: Amazon.comSpeaking of Amazon, astudyin June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers   initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This   may be only the beginning. A largerstudyin September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin   their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search   engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and   34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage   this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid   search, which will include not only products it sells, but items   not available on the site. This product and paid search will   extend to its virtual personal assistantAlexa and its Echohome systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this   will likely compete directly for Google's advertising   dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry   into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime   membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a   natural entry into the field.Those little things can add upGoogle is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a   result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates   falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The   company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most   recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid   clicks up 36% year over year.Alphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's   search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position   could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow   over time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

An Amazon-PayPal Partnership Still Doesn't Make Sense;2/8/2017;"WhenPayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL) split fromeBay(NASDAQ: EBAY) in 2015, it opened the door for the payments   processor to partner with a lot more online merchants.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been at the top of PayPal investors' wish   lists ever since. Partnering with the world's largest online   retailer would provide a huge growth catalyst.PayPal CEO Dan Schulman provided some hope to investors in an   interview withBloombergfollowing the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. ""We have   been in conversations with Amazon,"" he said.Image source: PayPalmakeArticleAd();The benefits would be huge for PayPal, but it's still not   clear what Amazon could get out of PayPal. Even though PayPal has   shed eBay -- one of Amazon's biggest competitors -- it still   doesn't make sense for the two companies to partner up.""Your margin is my opportunity""Amazon famously operates on extremely thin margins. While   payment processing represents a small portion of the online   retailer's operating costs (falling under its fulfillment   expenses), every penny counts. Through the first nine months of   2016, the operating margin for Amazon's retail operations was   just 0.7%.While Amazon uses third-party services to process credit   cards, PayPal's take rate is significantly higher than the   standard processing fees of traditional back-end payment   processors. PayPal's standard fee is 2.9% plus $0.30 for U.S.   transactions, and 3.9% plus a fixed fee for international   payments. Amazon would surely get a deal from PayPal, but the   latter is still in business to make a profit.Amazon would be sacrificing some profit in a partnership with   PayPal. The question then is, would it receive benefits that   offset the opportunity cost of sticking exclusively with its   existing payment processors?What does PayPal bring to the table?PayPal's biggest use is for onboarding new customers. It   allows them to skip the step of entering payment information, and   it provides an added layer of fraud protection. The only problem   is, Amazon already has so many customers.PayPal has nearly 200 million active accounts, which sounds   like a lot until you consider that Amazon surpassed 300 million   active customers over a year ago. There aren't many incremental   customers for Amazon to gain from the partnership.In addition, PayPal's strength in recent years has been its   mobile-checkout system, which is a place many online retailers   struggle. Amazon, however, has significantly outperformed the   rest of the industry on mobile.PayPal does bring valuable data to the table. It holds data   from years of partnering with eBay, which is one of Amazon's   biggest competitors. It also has data pertaining to many smaller   online retailers, which could provide Amazon with new verticals   or products to invest in. Whether the retail giant will have   access to that data is unclear, and how valuable it really is to   Amazon is equally vague.A lopsided dealA partnership with PayPal doesn't provide much meaningful   value to Amazon, whereas PayPal gets several benefits: access to   the largest online retailer, the third-party merchants that use   Amazon's marketplace, and at least some of its shopper data.   While Amazon wouldn't be feeding valuable data directly to its   competitor now that PayPal has split ties with eBay, it's still   relinquishing its iron grip on shopper data that provides it a   competitive advantage.PayPal investors should celebrate if there's even a small   partnership between the two companies, but Amazon investors won't   have much to cheer about.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Commentary on that initiative will be closely watched on the Q4 conference call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announced a new ""Premium"" service to compete with offerings fromSpotify,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThat product should roll out shortly, potentially boosting growth in 2017. And Pandora has said it is aiming to return to Ebitda profitability in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investors in P stock should believe the company.A Busy 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actually is up about 65% over the past year, after coming close to all-time lows in early 2016. Those gains have come despite mixed performance in the business. Revenue is up 14% through the first nine months, and likely rose a similar figure in Q4. But about half the year-to-date growth came from the acquisition of TicketFly last October. Advertising revenue also increased 14% through the first three quarters - but came solely from higher pricing. Active users were actually down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscription revenue declined in the quarter as well.The user and subscription figures are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simply doesn't trust that Pandora can create consistent profits based on advertising revenue alone. That's particularly true given thehigher royalty ratesthat took effect at the beginning of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrade One to Plus - adding features like song replays - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-based model.The plan from Pandora, as detailed after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provide a more stable revenue base. Moving customers to subscription-based services both helps margins and improves retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock likely will rise. But that remains a relatively big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earnings report, then, the most important numbers likely will come from the company's guidance. That guidance will give some color as to how successful management thinks Plus has been so far - and what kind of opportunity Premium has to boost Pandora earnings this year.But the Pandora earnings conference call also seems like it might move P stock. Management will have another opportunity to detail its strategy for 2017 and beyond. The company laid out its ""three-legged stool"" strategy - Plus, Premium and Ticketfly - after the third quarter, but investors weren't terribly impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsThe issue with P stock is that there's a real fear that Pandora's model simply doesn't quite work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenced by the nearly 80 million active users. But it's not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalty rates through ad revenue alone. The company did announce layoffs ofabout 7%of its employees in a bid to improve 2017 profits. That simply raised additional concerns about Pandora stock. The most notable is: Can Pandora really compete with Apple, Spotify andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?After all, those companies have much larger businesses - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the company has burned about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarters of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is likely to be huge as well, and that's not counting depreciation or the additional $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreciate in the near term, the company needs to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidance given in the Pandora earnings report will be key. But that aside, investors also will be looking for more information on the plan going forward here.Can Pandora find a niche in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offerings from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there really a profitable business model here, or are royalty rates simply too difficult to manage?Those questions can't be answered quite yet, but investors will be looking at the Pandora earnings report closely to better assess the company's prospects. And it's likely the commentary on the future - not the past - that will determine how Pandora stock reacts to Q4 earnings.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

5 Stocks for 17% Returns This Year (VLO, VCS, CAH, PRU, JNS);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few weeks ago we discussedhow you can make 12% annually, forever, from stocks.makeArticleAd();Now let's apply those lessons to 2017, and highlight five that should do even better (17%+ returns) this year (and likely beyond).Remember, projecting our returns from any given stock is simple. We simply add together the three ways it can pay us:Its current dividend.A future dividend hike.Share repurchases.It also helps if the stock is inexpensive, as buybacks deliver more bang for management's buck. So let's stick with stocks that are dirt-cheap, trading for 10-times free cash flow (FCF) or less for this exercise.Here's an example of a stock ready to return 17% or more over the next year.Blue chip refinerValero Energy Corporation(VLO) has a great management team that knows how to make money no matter what happens with energy prices.Over the last five years the company has increased its free cash flow (FCF) by 115% per share while rewarding investors with a cumulative 300% dividend raise,even as oil prices were chopped in half:A Free Cash Flow MachineShares yield 3.6% today - that's money in our pocket. Plus management recently raised its dividend byanother16.7%. And dividend hikes have everything to do with future returns.Here's why: Early next year, Valero will tee up another payout increase. It will probably be a 10 cents per share raise (in line with the last three hikes).The company hasplentyof cash to do this already. It generated $10.40 in FCF over the past twelve months, and will only pay out $2.80 in dividends over the next twelve!A ""one dime"" hike would be 14%. And if Valero's shares stand still, they'll yield more than 4% this time next year.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenBut here's the thing - they probably won't pay 4% then because investors will bid Valero's price up (and its yield down) in anticipation of the hike. After all, even 3% is generous today.Which means that Valero's share price should climb in line with its next hike. And that's exactly what was unfoldinguntillate-2015, when the stock ""decoupled"" from its dividend's trajectory:Valero's Stock Due To ""Catch Up""This means Valero's share price actually has two past dividend hikes to ""catch up"" with as well. The stock easily has 30% to 40% upside thanks to past, present and future payout hikes alone.And let's not forget share repurchases! The firm bought back 15.5% of its outstanding float over the last three years, and should continue to be a buyer of its own bargain stock.Buybacks, by the way, are underrated as a driver of returns. When the number of shares is reduced, every ""per share"" metric - dividends per share, earnings, and FCF - all improve. And their increases are leveraged to the amount of stock that is bought back.After all, if profits are flat while float is reduced by 50%, the result is a 100% increase in earnings per share! And repurchases also support dividend growth. In Valero's case, it has fewer and fewer shares to ""settle up with"" every year, so it can hike its payout more than it would otherwise with a static share count.Four More Stocks With Booming Shareholder ReturnsIt sounds easy to bank double-digit returns like these, but here's the catch - in today's expensive stock market, Valero doesn't have much company in the bargain bin.In fact, I count just 19 firms today that:Pay a meaningful current yield (2%+).Are growing their dividend 10%+ annually.Have reduced their outstanding share count over the past 12 months.And are dirt-cheap (at less than 10-times FCF).Some of these dividend growers are dogs though, as their business models are being eaten alive. But a few gems are set to endure.Here's a four-pack worthy of additional consideration.Stocks for 17% Returns This Year: CVS Health Corp (CVS)CVS Health Corp(CVS) runs the country's largest drugstore chain, a pharmacy-benefit-management business and 1,100 in-store medical clinics. E-commerce websites such asAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) may be eating into traditional retail sales, but they're not a threat when it comes to prescription drug fulfillment.The stock's yield has ""rallied"" to its highest levels since in the past decade:CVS Health's Highest Yield in 10 YearsA 2.3% payout sounds modest until we add in likely 15%+ dividend growth later this year (CVS has hiked its dividend by 208% over the last five years). Plus a few percentage points worth of buybacks, and we've got a prescription for 20% returns.Stocks for 17% Returns This Year: Cardinal Health Inc (CAH)Cardinal Health Inc(CAH) investors are also due for a big 2017. They enter the year holding shares trading for just 9.2-times free cash flow (FCF). They'll probably receive a double-digit dividend increase in the first half of the year. And their stock price hasn't even caught up to last year's hike yet!CAH Stock Price (Blue) Lags Its Payout (Orange)Stocks for 17% Returns This Year: Prudential Financial Inc (PRU)Life insurerPrudential Financial Inc(PRU)trades for just 2.5-times FCF and an equally laughable 81% of book value (or what it would be worth if it were broken up and sold off today). That's despite the fact that, as a life insurer, it's well positioned to profit from the three rate hikes the Fed's planning this year; PRU invests its ""float""-or the premiums it takes in-in low-risk, interest-bearing securities.The stock pays 2.6% today, and PRU has plenty of room to keep raising its dividend with a modest 26% payout ratio.Since we first discussed this bargain last May, shares have rallied 35%. They're still comically cheap.Finally Bill Gross' new home hasn't been hospitable to shareholders after the stock's initial ""Bond King pop.""Janus Capital Group Inc(JNS) sits 14% lower today than it did when the legendary bond strategist joined the firm.But Janus has increased its dividend by 38% during Gross' reign, and it's due for another hike. Shares pay 3.6% today, their highest mark ever.As I've said before, while buying stocks at all-time highs can be scary, buyingyieldsat all-time highs is often a simple yet effective market timing strategy. Gross & Co. agree - they've repurchased 1.8% of the firm's outstanding shares over the last 12 months.The Sweet Spot: 7% YieldsWithDividend GrowthBlue chip stocks like Cardinal Health and CVS rarely pay current yields more than 3% or 4%. They are simply too popular and likewise usually too expensive.You'll do even better focusing on stealth income plays such as closed-end funds, preferred shares and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In many cases, these issues pay secure yields of 7% or better - with dividend growth to boot!This means you are assuring yourself of 10%+ annual returns, with most of that coming as cash dividends. These vehicles are safe, but they aren't as well known as your average blue chip. And that's agoodthing for us, because we can lock up secure income streams of 7% or more while enjoying payout growth and price upside to boot.These stealth plays are the perfect investments for 2017. Regardless of Trump's next tweet, these 7% payers are going to become increasingly popular with retirees as they're discovered. Make sure you buy them now, before their prices get bid up (and their yields are compressed).Click here for the details about my favorite 7% plays in funds, preferreds and REITs - and I'll share the names, tickers and buy prices with you, too.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe post5 Stocks for 17% Returns This Year (VLO, VCS, CAH, PRU, JNS)appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Why Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian Opportunity;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) stock provides a play for contrarians heading into its fourth-quarter earnings report. Earnings and sales have declined year-over-year in each of the lastsixquarters, which should keep expectations low. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts appear to be exiting KO stock en masse.makeArticleAd();Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Morgan Stanley cut Coca-Cola stock to 'Equal Weight' in December; Goldman Sachs downgraded KO to 'Sell' last month and Wells Fargofollowed with its own re-rating to Neutral barely a week later. For investors who like to buy at the point of maximum pessimism, the Coca-Cola earnings report looks like an opportunity.Of course, KO stock isn't likely to make a huge gain off of the Coca-Cola earnings report; the stock generally doesn't move all that much. In fact, the relatively quiet movement in Coca-Cola stock actually has been one reason analysts have turned bearish. Those analysts argue that in a more optimistic market, with broad indexes at all-time highs, KO stock's ""defensive"" nature seems less attractive. Thus, investors are ""rotating"" away from safe, solid names like Coca-Cola andProcter & Gamble Co(NYSE:PG) into higher-risk, higher-reward issues.Perhaps this is true, but that argument only works as long as broad markets remain at or near their highs. And for Q4, that pessimism seems to leave KO stock well-positioned for gains coming out of its report.When expectations are low, after all, it's difficult to disappoint. But the Q4 report also has long-term implications. It will be the first earnings release after the appointment of new CEO James Quincey. Quincey isn't new to Coca-Cola; he has worked at the company for twenty years. And outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent doesn't leave until May.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBut the Q4 earnings call might give Quincey a chance to detail the company's plans to deal with consumer shifts away from soda. Those plans may be of more interest to investors in KO stock than the Q4 numbers.The KO Stock NumbersAnalyst consensus projects KO stock will generate fourth-quarter earnings of $0.38, down a penny year-over-year. Revenue is expected to decline sharply, falling 8.7% year-over-year.Those estimates aren't quite as bad as they sound, however. The strong dollar is affecting revenue: it reduced Q3 revenue by 2%, for instance. Coca-Cola also has refranchised bottling operations, which has affected revenue. In the third quarter, for instance, reported revenue was down 7%. But the company's figure of 'organic' revenue - growth excluding divested operations and currency effects - rose 3%.KO is still targeting over $600 million in productivity savings this year. And KO also has brought in nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in proceeds from the refranchising proceeds. The cost savings and cash inflow are being used in part to fund new marketing, but also are improving margins.And if Coca-Cola earnings show further margin improvements, and a surprise earnings beat that shows some bottom-line growth, the narrative here could change. With analysts pricing in a declining business, any sort of growth in Q4 could provide a nice boost to KO stock.The Coca-Cola Earnings Release: The StoryNumbers aside, investors no doubt are more interested in the company's long-term strategy. It's highly unlikely that Coca-Cola will disclose some massive change in its operations, to be sure. The current focus on cost control, and the refranchising efforts, seem likely to persist.But KO does have some options in terms of strategy. Unlike its chief rivalPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP), which owns Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola notably no longer has a food business. Coke reportedly considered making an offer for yogurt manufacturer Chobani, and a move to diversify away from beverages could provide a more stable revenue base. The company also owns nearly 17% ofMonster Beverage Corporation(NASDAQ:MNST), and could decide to make a play for the rest of that company.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAnd the mega-merger still sits on the horizon. Many analysts are convinced thatAnheuser Busch Inbev NV (ADR)(NYSE:BUD) will eventually make a play for KO stock. The departure of Warren Buffett's son Howard from the KO board has either fueled or dampened that speculation, depending on the analyst. Howard Buffett's exit could meanBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) is looking to sell its stake in KO stock. Or it could mean that Warren Buffett and Berkshire are interested in being part of a takeover - and don't want to face the conflict implied by having a seat on Coca-Cola's board.So while there's reason to see some contrarian optimism toward the report from a fundamental standpoint, the real story out of the KO earnings report will be the story management tells to investors. With a strong balance sheet, a new CEO and a number of M&A options, Coca-Cola has a lot of paths to take. Investors will be listening closely to see if KO management gives any hint as to its direction.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great7 Dividend Growth Stocks on Sale TodayThe postWhy Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian Opportunityappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Here's What Amazon Actually Plans for Physical Stores;2/8/2017;"AsAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has dipped its toes into the water of building   physical retail locations, rumors of its eventual plans have   included all sorts of things that the company has not actually   done. When a retail chain struggles, there are speculative   stories about the online retailer buying it. In addition, there   have been stories like a recent one inThe New York Postthat claimed Amazon had plans for an automated, two-story grocery   store that required as few as three workers to operate.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took toTwitterto vehemently deny that any such plan existed. Hetweetedin part ""whoever your anonymous sources are on this story ...   they've mixed up their meds!"" The CEO followed that up with   another tweet rebutting the idea that his company had figured out   how to use robot-run stores to dramatically improve typical   grocery store margins: ""... if anybody knows how to get 20%   margins in groceries, call me! :)""It was a very strong denial by Bezos, but just because this   story is not true (or at least the company claims it isn't) does   not mean Amazon does not have brick-and-mortar plans. The   retailer does, and CFO Brian Olsavsky laid them out during   the company's Q4 earnings call on Feb. 2, which was transcribed   bySeeking Alpha(registration required).makeArticleAd();Amazon may not be prepping robot-run stores, but it does       use them in its warehouses. Image source: Amazon.What are Amazon's retail plans?While the media and the public seem to expect Amazon to make a   grand entrance into physical retail, its near-term plans remain   modest. The company currently has one Amazon Go store -- a   convenience store with automated checkout -- and while Olsavsky   called the Seattle store ""very interesting,"" he also noted ""it's   only one store at this time."" He called the single store a ""beta""   and acknowledged that ""we like the promise of that,"" but stopped   short of announcing plans for expansion.The CFO did say to expect more brick-and-mortar Amazon   bookstore locations. Even there, though, the company's plans   remain modest. ""We have three physical stores; Seattle, San   Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this   year,"" he said. ""So we're still in that phase where we're testing   and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore.""Olsavsky also acknowledged that Amazon has tested pop-up   stores, where you can learn about and buy Amazon devices and   services, and ""college pickup points,"" where online orders   can be picked up. He implied that there would be expansion of the   campus format saying it ""creates a great value,"" but did not   commit to adding a specific amount. The CFO did not entirely shut   down the idea of launching other formats, but he made it clear   that experiments would continue.""So not much projection beyond where we are today except for   the fact that we will be adding more bookstores,"" he said. ""But   we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a   really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see   them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot   of value in that as well.""Amazon is taking it slowIt's easy to see why Amazon customers would love the company   to put stores around the country. On the other hand, it's also   easy to see why the online retailer has taken it very slowly.   Amazon's chief advantage has long been that it does not have the   overhead associated with traditional physical retailers. Adding   stores means adding expense and that's something the company has   correctly been very cautious about.There may someday be thousands of Amazon bookstores,   convenience stores, and maybe even robot-run grocery stores. That   day, however, is not imminent. The online retailer is still   testing the waters and while it's growing its physical portfolio,   it's doing so slowly, which seems to be how it will proceed for   the immediate future.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

"Twilio (TWLO) Q4 Loss Narrower than Expected; Guides Well";2/8/2017;"Twilio Inc.TWLOended 2016 on a strong note as evident from the better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. The company's top and bottom line not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also recorded a solid year-over-year improvement.Although the company reported adjusted loss (including one-time expenses and income but excluding stock based compensation) of 10 cents per share, it was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. Furthermore, on a non-GAAP basis, the company achieved breakeven, which not only compared favorably with the year-ago quarter's loss of 7 cents but also its own guided range of a loss of 5 cents to 6 cents.The year-over-year improvement in the bottom line was mainly driven by strong top-line growth, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses as well as higher share count.Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTwilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Twilio Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe company's fourth quarter revenues surged 59.6% year over year to $82 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $73.9 million. Also, it came ahead of the previously guided range of $72.5 million to $74.5 million.The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by seasonal contribution from elections in the United States and Brazil as well as strong year-over-year growth in active customer account. During the quarter, the company registered a 44% rise in active customer account, adding over 2,000 new active customer accounts, bringing the total count to 36,606 as of Dec 31, 2016.Adjusted gross profit increased 66.2% year over year to $48.2 million while margin improved 240 basis points (bps) to 58.8%. Per Twilio ""a favorable mix of usage in higher-margin geographies internationally, ongoing efficiency gains, and some end-of-year refunds and accrual reversals"" positively impacted gross margin.Adjusted operating expenses were up 53% year over year to $56.7 million.

However, as a percentage of revenues it declined to -10.4% from -15.7% reported in the year-ago quarter.

The company's fourth quarter results were better than expected. The company also registered year-over-year improvement on both counts. Furthermore, it provided an optimistic guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017.The company boasts a strong clientele that includes the likes of NetflixNFLX, salesforce.comCRMand Twitter among others. Furthermore, the long-standing relationship with AmazonAMZNis particularly noticeable. Twilio uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) to host its platform. Moreover, Amazon had invested during Twilio's Series E round funding in 2015.The partnership with Amazon will provide the company exposure to the e-commerce giant's massive customer base. Per the recently extended partnership, Twilio will now provide voice notifications in addition to SMS messages through the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).Despite a healthy customer base and strong relationship with Amazon, we believe registering growth in 2017 will be hard. Intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns.

Management plans to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the long term.Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 55 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation but excluding all other non-recurring items and related tax impact) of 72 cents remained flat on a year-over-year basis but increased almost 6% sequentially.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseAkamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteRevenues of $616.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $606 million and rose almost 6.4% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 5.5% from the previous quarter. The revenues were better than management's guided range of $593-$613 million. The growth was driven by strong holiday season media traffic.Excluding Internet Platform Customers, revenues increased 14.4% year over year (also 15% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 6% quarter over quarter.Revenues from Internet Platform Customers were $58.4 million, plunging 36.3% year over year (down 40% adjusted for foreign exchange) primarily due to the company's do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives of building CDN. Sequentially, revenues from Internet Platform Customers inched up 0.6%.Amazon.comAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix are the six large customers in the Internet Platform group. Collectively these six companies accounted for less than 10% of the Akamai's fourth-quarter 2016 revenues down from almost 16% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings were $2.70 per share, up 7.1% driven by revenue growth of 6.5%, which totaled $2.34 billion in full year 2016. Revenue excluding Internet Platform Customers was $2.09 billion, up 15% from 2015. Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $365 million, up 43% on a year-over-year basis (up 44% when adjusted for foreign exchange).Segment DetailsEffective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions - Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier. This marks a shift from the earlier product-focused structure to a customer-focused structure.Media Division - Revenues declined 0.5% year over year (flat when adjusted for foreign exchange) but up roughly 5.9% sequentially to $300.8 million. Excluding Internet Platform customers, revenues advanced 15% from the year-ago quarter.Web Division - Revenues increased 13.4% year over year (up 14% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 5.5% sequentially to $300.3 million. Growth was driven by strong customer base, especially with regard to the cloud security business.Enterprise and Carrier Division - Revenues of $15 million surged 26.2% from the year-ago quarter (43% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 2.1% on sequential basis.However, in order to give better perspective to its investors, the company continued to report results per its old structure (solution category-wise).Performance & security solutions revenues were up 16.7% year over year (19% adjusted for foreign exchange) to $367.4 million. Of it, $102 million was generated from Akamai's cloud security solutions, which surged 41% on a year-over-year basis.Service & support system revenues rose 14.4% year over year to $52.6 million while Media Delivery solutions sales declined 10.2% year over year to $196.1 million. Excluding the six large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenues were up 8% year over year.On a sequential basis, Performance & security, Media Delivery solutions and Service & support system increased 6.5%, 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively.Operating DetailsReported gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 200 bps to 67% in the quarter.Akamai reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, down 100 bps each both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.As percentage of revenues, reported research & development (R&D) expense increased 110 bps year over year and 30 bps sequentially. General & Administrative (G&A) expense also increased 170 bps from the year-ago quarter but declined 40 bps from the previous quarter.The year-over-year increase in these expenses were partially mitigated by lower selling & marketing (S&M) expense, which declined 120 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, on a sequential basis S&M increased 170 bps.Reported operating margin contracted 110 bps on a year-over-year basis but expanded 90 bps sequentially to 20%. Adjusted operating margin declined 130 bps from the year-ago quarter but increased 40 bps from the previous quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs on Dec 31, 2016, Akamai's cash and cash equivalents (and marketable securities) were $837 million compared with $868.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. The company generated cash flow from operations of $181.8 million as compared with $251.4 million in the previous quarter.Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter. In 2016, free cash flow soared 72% year over year to $550 million.In the quarter, Akamai repurchased 1.3 million shares for $79 million. In full year 2016, the company spent $374 million on buying back approximately 7 million shares.GuidanceFor first-quarter 2017, Akamai continues to expect foreign exchange to remain a headwind due to strengthening of the U.S dollar. Further, revenues are expected to decline sequentially due to seasonal weakness particularly in the Media business. The company expects revenues in the range of $596 million to $610 million.Reported gross margins are expected to be 65%. Adjusted operating expenses are anticipated in the range of $217-$222 million, down sequentially.Further, EBITDA margin is anticipated to be approximately 39-40%. Management forecasts EBITDA margins to remain in the high 30% range in 2017.Depreciation is expected to be in the range of $74-$76 million. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 27-28% for the quarter.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of 66-69 cents per share.In terms of capital expenditure, Akamai expects to spend approximately $90-$96 million in the quarter. For full year 2017, capital expenditure would equate to 16-18% of revenues, in line with the company's long-term model of 16-18% of revenues and better than 14% in 2016.Our TakeAkamai is likely to benefit from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video. Additionally, it is likely to gain from its strong foothold in the web applications domain. New products like Enterprise Application Access (EAA) and the Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) service will expand customer base going ahead.However, DIY initiatives by the large Internet companies remain a concern for the company's media delivery business. Moreover, recently launched products like Bot Manager and Image Manager will take some time to fully penetrate the market. Hence, we don't expect revenue growth to accelerate at least in the near term.Further, faster increase in capital expenditure and increasing headcount investment will keep margins under pressure in full year 2017.Despite the headwinds, we believe that the company has significant growth prospect in 2017. We note that Akamai has outperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry in the last one-year. While the stock has gained 79.8%, the industry returned 18.5% over the same period.Currently, Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeDisney(NYSE:DIS-Free Report),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) andAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Disney Earnings in-Depth: ESPN Woes Hurt RevenuesDisney (NYSE:DIS-Free Report) just reported its first-quarter 2017 earnings, and the massive media conglomerate is garnering plenty of attention today because of it. While Disney has its hands in a lot of things, perhaps the most intriguing part of today's report is the new data from its Media Networks division.Disney's Media Networks, which includes all-day sports programming channel ESPN, has been the focus of investors over the past few years due to increased competition from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report), Hulu, and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) Prime Video. ESPN and Disney's other channels are inherently linked to cable subscriptions, meaning that the ""cord-cutting"" phenomenon has cut into the company's revenues.In the fourth quarter of 2016, Disney's Media Networks division brought in $5.658 billion, down from $5.826 billion in the comparable quarter.In the prior-year quarter, the Media Networks segment saw revenues of $6.332 billion. According to today's report, Media Networks saw first-quarter 2017 revenues of $6.233 billion, which represents a 2% year-over-year decline.Breaking this down a bit, Cable Networks, a division within Media Networks that includes channels like ESPN, saw revenues decrease 2% to $4.4 billion. In the earnings report, the company said that the decrease in operating income in this division was due to ""a decrease at ESPN.""""The decrease at ESPN was due to higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue, partially offset by affiliate revenue growth,"" the company said, pointing the finger at College Football Playoff games and more expensive contracts with the NBA and NFL.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Apple Inc. Taps Head of Amazon Fire to Run Apple TV (AAPL);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its Q1 financials in January, there was little said about Apple TV sales. The poor performance of AAPL's Other Products division - despiterecord setting Apple Watch sales- said it all. However, it looks as though AAPL is turning its focus once again to its often neglected set-top streamer.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere's no word of new Apple TV hardware, but the company has made a big move. News just broke that the company hired the former head of rivalAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV to take over as marketing vice president for Apple TV.New Apple TV Hire Sends SignalsBloombergreported last night that AAPL has hired Timothy D. Twerdahl as thenew marketing VP for Apple TV. Any new hire for the position would be worth noting, but in this case the company's choice is very interesting.According toBloomberg, Twerdahl came to Apple by way of Amazon, where he headed up the very successful Fire TV unit. Snagging one of your primary competitors is always a bit of a coup, but in this case, Apple's hire has an even more compelling background. Prior to his work with the Fire TV, Twerdahl was an executive withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and a vice president overseeing consumer devices atRoku.In other words, the new Apple TV boss previously headed up the top two competing video streamers and had a senior position with the world's number one video streaming service. That's a pretty good hire and not one the company would make unless it's serious about goosing those sliding Apple TV sales.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialBloombergnotes that the previous head of Apple TV marketing is being moved to a role helping to lead AAPL's efforts in securing streaming content deals.Apple TV Needs the PushWhile AAPL's set-top streamer got a sales push with the release of the new fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015, it wasn't able to maintain that momentum. The Apple TV may have games and its own App Store, but unlike the competition, there's no 4K video support and AAPL's box carries a hefty price premium.Even though AAPL doubled its Apple TV sales compared to the previous year when it introduced the new Apple TV in 2015, it still fell short of Roku, Amazon Fire TV andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chromecast in market share.AAPL lumps the Apple TV into its Other Products division and doesn't spike out sales numbers. However, in the company's Q1 earnings report, revenue for Other Products declined by 8% year-over-year. Considering that it had a record-setting quarter for Apple Watch sales - the other major product in that division - the numbers point toward poor holiday sales for the Apple TV.No New Apple TV Hardware, YetOf course, even poaching the competition's top guy and someone with the breadth of experience that APPL's new hire appears to have can only go so far without revamping the product.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?The current, nearly year and a half old, Apple TV carries a huge price premium. AAPL charges a minimum of $149 for its box - double the going rate for competing hardware from Amazon, Google and Roku - and despite the big dollars the Apple TV lacks 4K video support.AAPL was able to shrug that off in 2015 when 4K video was more bleeding edge, but consumers now expect the feature. New content to populate thatTV app hubApple has been showing off won't hurt, but job one for Twerdahl will be dealing with the hardware gap.There's no word on new Apple TV hardware, yet. But with a new VP in place, his predecessor focusing on acquiring additional content and sales continuing to slide, the pressure is on for AAPL to either cut prices or introduce a new, fifth-generation box. Or both.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the King;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, e-commerce giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) released disappointing holiday sales figures that caused investors to question the firm and send AMZN stock down roughly 3%. While the company produced fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, the firm's revenue and future guidance figures came in below estimates.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's lacklusterearnings resultsmay have shocked the broader market, but investors would be wise to use AMZN stock's loss as a buying opportunity because shares of the company very rarely go on sale.Amazon has a lot of potential and its willingness to invest in the future makes it a great long-term bet. While AMZN stock is still expensive at just over $810 per share and a price-to-earnings ratio of 186, the firm's share price could make its way above $900 by the end of the year.AMZN Stock: Three Reasons to Keep the Miss in PerspectiveIt's never a good thing when a company misses revenue expectations and issues worse-than-expected forward guidance. However, it's important to take a look at why AMZN's fourth-quarter earnings shook out the way they did and whether it's a deal breaker for investors considering picking up Amazon stock.Some of the reason for the revenue miss can be explained by currency fluctuations, whichhurtthe retailer's revenue figures by around $558 million. Amazon is also adjusting to its fast-growing marketplace and the number of merchants that have joined the firm's ""fulfilled by Amazon"" program.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis has in-turn increased shipping costs, but the long-term benefits of the growing number of ""fulfilled by Amazon"" merchants outweigh the short-term negatives. It allows Amazon to offer its Prime members a greater selection of items and will likely help AMZN grab an even larger marketshare.Speaking of Amazon Prime, the loyalty program is another good reason for investors to get behind Amazon stock. Not only do Prime's subscription fees provide AMZN with a passive revenue stream, but the program helps bind people to its ecosystem.Prime has expanded to include benefits like dash-buttons, which allow people to reorder certain products at the click of a button, and movie and music streaming. Prime members who use all of Amazon's services are not only more likely to buy additional Amazon products like the firm's virtual assistant Alexa, but they will also shop at its website before considering rivals - even if it doesn't offer the lowest prices.AMZN is doing with retail whatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) did with technology: building a brand that people will continue to buy into because it is convenient and connected.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200However, while the company's dominance in retail is a big reason to buy AMZN stock, one of the most compelling elements of the firm's business is Amazon Web Services - the firm's cloud computing arm. The cloud computing space represents a huge area for growth as the industry is relatively new, but AWS has already become one of the largest players.AWS has been slowly making up a larger and larger percentage of Amazon's total sales, and the fourth quarter was no exception. The firm's cloud computing arm has been growing rapidly over the last year and as the industry continues to expand, investors can expect AWS to add to Amazon's bottom line in a larger and larger capacity.Bottom Line on Amazon StockAMZN stock's stumble last week has given investors an opening to add shares to their portfolios. While there was some weakness in the company's fourth-quarter results, the firm is on track to continue growing and Amazon stock will likely deliver outstanding gains in the year ahead.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL and AMZN.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Gold Stocks That Will Shine Under TrumpThe post3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Amazon.com, Inc.;2/7/2017;"They are two of the strongest companies in the world. Before   you go to bed each night, you've likely spent time using bothMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) suite of technology products, and bought,   received, or streamed content viaAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .An investment of $1,000 in Microsoft or Amazon back in 1997   would now be worth $8,000 or $540,000, respectively! While   there's a big gap between the two, both are impressive   returns.But which is the better buy today? To be honest, you can't go   wrong buying either one of these companies. If forced to choose,   however, here are three different lenses through which you can   evaluate the question and decide for yourself.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty ImagesSustainable competitive advantagesIf you're going to choose to forgo the safe route of buying   index funds and try your hand at investing in individual stocks,   there's no variable you should spend more time focusing on than a   company's sustainable competitive advantage. Often called a   ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive   advantages are what keep customers coming back, year after year   and decade after decade.For Microsoft, the moat is pretty easy to define. The company   owns some of the most widely used applications in the world,   including the Microsoft Office Suite and Windows. While the   company also has hardware products available and its Azure cloud   competing service is growing rapidly, the moats provided by these   offerings are much narrower.Amazon, on the other hand, has a host of moats. First, the   company's impressive network of fulfillment centers allows it to   deliver packages quicker than anyone else. And it would costbillionsin upfront investments for any company to come close to touching   this. Second, the company's membership rolls in Amazon Prime --   while not publicly disclosed -- are likely over fifty   million.But perhaps most importantly, the company has begun to benefit   from the network effect: as Prime membership grows, the number of   third-party vendors using Amazon's fulfillment services is   swelling. With each new Prime member, a vendor is incentivized to   use Amazon's platform. And with each new vendor, a potential   customer is incentivized to shop on Amazon. That creates averypowerful moat.While I hardly think Microsoft is in trouble, I'm giving the   edge here to Amazon.Winner = AmazonFinancial FortitudeIt's great to see money returned to you every quarter in the   form of dividends. It's even better to see cash being reinvested   for exciting growth opportunities in the future. But at the end   of the day, there's no substitute for boring old cash sitting in   the bank.That's because every company, at some time, will face economic   difficulties. Those that face such times with cash in the bank   have options: they can outspend rivals into oblivion, buy back   shares on the cheap, or even make acquisitions.Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to   narrow their focus just to meet the demands of their   creditors.Here's how Amazon and Microsoft stack up in terms of financial   fortitude.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowMicrosoft$132 billion$59 billion$16.8 billion$27.5 billionAmazon$26 billion$8 billion$2.4 billion$9.7 billionData source: Yahoo! FinanceAs I said at the outset, these are two of the strongest   companies in the world. That is reflected in their balance   sheets. If I were forced to choose a winner here, however,   Microsoft would take the crown. The company creates massive free   cash flow from its core Windows and Office platforms, and it is   one of only two companies left that have AAA credit ratings from   Standard & Poor's.Amazon's no slouch either. But CEO/Founder Jeff Bezos is   (in)famous for playing the uber-long game -- reinvesting revenue   into the business to further build an impenetrable moat around   the company.Winner = Microsoft.ValuationFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science,   there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us   an idea of how expensive each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioDividendFCF PayoutMicrosoft22182.32.4%42%Amazon176402.9N/AN/AData source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures   from non-GAAP earnings.Given Bezos' aforementioned penchant for trading a dollar   today for the potential of earning ten dollars tomorrow, Amazon   looks very expensive. This has almost always been the case. And   investors that have passed on Amazon because of it have paid the   price in missed returns the whole time.That being said, it's hard not to give the valuation edge to   Microsoft. The company trades for a reasonable valuation, and it   offers a solid and sustainable dividend.Winner = MicrosoftAnd the winner is...MicrosoftSo there you have it: While Amazon has a more impressive moat,   Microsoft has both a better balance sheet and a more reasonable   valuation. That being said, it would be disingenuous of me not to   mention that Amazon is by far my largest personal holding,   accounting for a whopping 19% of my family's real-life   holdings.That's not necessarily because we've invested a lot in the   stock. Rather, it's because shares have appreciated by so much   since we first bought shares back in 2010. That being said, this   type of review encourages me to look further at making a purchase   of Microsoft, which has a lot going for it as well.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: Industry Comments on Visa Ban;2/7/2017;"The technology sector has grown increasingly dependent on foreign talent over the years such that today it can't function without it. On the face of things, this has been really good for innovation helping the U.S. maintain its technological lead over others. But digging down a bit deeper, what this means is that the U.S. is increasingly incapable of producing this talent itself. This is not a good situation to be in, particularly when you consider that countries like China are doing all they can to develop indigenous intellectual property.That's probably the reason President Trump's draft proposal according to Bloomberg reads as follows: ""Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest… Visa programs for foreign workers... should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers - our forgotten working people - and the jobs they hold.""There are many conflicting views and opinions about H-1B visas that companies use to employ people from other countries when adequate resources in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math aren't available locally. But since foreign labor is usually cheaper, critics say that companies tend to employ foreigners even when the skills are available thus depressing wages for the industry as a whole.Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University, has done extensive research on the topic. Supporters say there isn't room to control wage inflation since the program is highly regulated and technology companies like AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, in fact, pay handsomely.Whatever the opinion on the wage rate, there's no denying that the jobs go to foreigners. If the trend continues, high tech American employees will have a harder time finding jobs, thus gradually closing down the institutions producing them. The per capita GDP attributable to such jobs will also go down as tech employees from abroad obtain American citizenship.It's also true that a country is in a position of absorbing others, giving them a home, a job, etc. when it is itself in a position of strength. But when it can't find local tech workers, it's definitely not in that position and may need some temporary measures to rejuvenate.There's also another side to the story. If tech companies are unsuccessful in their letters of appeal, lawsuits and other measures they're taking against the President and the proposal is enforced, they may decide to employ the same talent in international facilities. A company's main motivation and objective is to generate profit, and there could be initial costs of setting up such international operations.The visa issue has been clubbed with another important one involving terrorism because the President has blocked all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days (the ban is indefinite for Syrian refugees possibly because of their acts of vandalism across Europe). Citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen were also banned from entering the U.S. for 90 days. This seems like a relatively short period of time and what will be achieved in the interim remains unclear.In the meantime, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed a complaint saying Trump's order is ""undermining the state's sovereign interests"" in violation of equal protection laws under the Fifth Amendment. Washington State also sued the President with support from Amazon and Microsoft.But don't imagine that the so-called refugees are helpless victims because they have plenty of powerful lobbies working for them. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are getting ready to file lawsuits. What's more, Google has created a ""crisis fund"" with $2 million and its employees have contributed a like amount that they are gifting the ACLU. Other funds are also on the way.But tech companies have plenty to say about both issues:Apple: CEO Tim Cook told employees that the company had communicated with the White House. ""I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued (Friday) restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support…Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,"" he wrote in an email.Google: CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo to employees: ""It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues…We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so."" He also said that at least 187 Google staff were affected by the ban.Founder Sergey Brin: ""It's a debate about fundamental values and thoughtful policymaking and many of the other things, I think, that are apparently not universally adored but I think the vast majority of our country and legislators support."" Google has a problem with the orders, including ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants. After planning their move for some days 2K+ Google employees from at least eight Google offices walked out on Monday afternoon.Facebook: Founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page: ""Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation."" In an official statement on Saturday, Facebook said: ""We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.""IntelINTC: Brian Krzanich: ""I have heard from many of you, and share your concern over the recent executive order and want you to know this is not a policy we can support,"" and ""First, as the grandson of immigrants and the CEO of a company that was co-founded by an immigrant, we believe that lawful immigration is critical to the future of our company and this nation.""One of Intel's first hires was Andy Grove, who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and ran Intel for 11 years establishing it as the leader in microprocessor technology. He also said: ""At Intel we believe that immigration is an important part of our diversity and inclusion efforts"" and ""Inclusion is about making everyone feel welcome and part of our community.""Its official statement says, ""We are providing support to potentially impacted employees, all of whom are in this country lawfully. As a company co-founded by an immigrant, we continue to support lawful immigration. We will continue to provide any impacted employees with Intel's full support.""A statement on the company website says that it supports ""legislative or administrative action to improve the immigration system for highly skilled employees."" Half its 106K employees work in other countries and its U.S. workers include roughly 3K foreigners on work visas for those with specialized skills. But the number of employees from the seven banned nations is not known. Intel explained its contribution to Trump's inaugural committee by saying that it gave Intel a seat at the table on issues important to the company.Microsoft: Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a letter to the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that there are currently 76 U.S. visa holders within the tech firm and 41 dependents who are citizens of the seven countries mentioned in the order. ""These are not situations that law-abiding individuals should be forced to confront when there is no evidence that they pose a security or safety threat to the United States,"" he said.Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, said, ""As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world"" while posting Smith's email to employees on LinkedIn. Microsoft is trying everything to keep its options open. On the one hand it is joining Washington state to sue Trump while on the other, it is requesting the government to make an exception for ""responsible known travelers with pressing needs"" so people with passports from one of the countries listed in the order can return to the U.S. as long as they have a valid work or student visa and have not committed a crime in the U.S.Micorsoft is also asking that employees and students affected by the ban be allowed to travel outside of the U.S. for business reasons, except to the seven countries on the list. It is also asking that people with passports from one of the countries be allowed to go home for family reasons on a case-by-case basis.Tesla: CEO Elon Musk, one of only a few tech executives on Trump's business advisory team and manufacturing jobs initiative: ""The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges,"" he tweeted on Saturday. ""Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.""TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey called the impact of the order ""real and upsetting.""Netflix: CEO Reed Hastings said, ""Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all… It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.""UberCEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would talk to Trump about it in President Trump's first business advisory group meeting. ""While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.'s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people,"" Kalanick said.BoxCEO Aaron Levie who is Iranian-American said ""At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now... We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process."" More broadly, the order sends ""the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,"" Levie said. ""It's very unfortunate and very disappointing.""SlackCEO Stewart Butterfield said ""Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but that doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right,"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. ""My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died.""Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator said in a blog: ""It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump's administration... The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers-if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+5.85%+20.10%FB-0.98%+5.29%GOOGL-2.95%+2.39%MSFT-3.22%+12.51%INTC-3.83%+4.79%CSCO+1.10%+1.92%AMZN-3.06%+5.53%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple in India: Apple will be assembling some iPhones in Bengaluru, the capital city of the south Indian state of Karnataka according to the state's IT minister Priyank Kharge. Taiwan's Wistron is setting up the unit that is expected to commence operations in the first half of 2017 (or by April-end according to some news sites).Apple has been trying to get concessions from the Indian government but progress on that front is not clear as of now. India is an important market for Apple, which sold 2.5 million iPhones in the country in 2016. An estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold in India by 2020, so one can understand why Apple CEO Tim Cook said that India is ""the place to be.""Apple Manufacturing In U.S.: Terry Gou, CEO of Apple's largest contractor Foxconn, has said that the company, along with top customer Apple, is considering the setting up of a display panel manufacturing unit in the U.S. that could create up to 50K jobs. The decision followed Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son's announcement about a $50 billion investment fund for the U.S.The Nikkei reported that another Pennsylvania plant was also in the works, but it would be involved in molding functions.  Foxconn-controlled Smart Technologies may also move production to the U.S. if President Trump is able to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement.Barclays Downgrades Apple: Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz doesn't have high expectations of the iPhone 8 because the maturing of the smartphone market means fewer upgrades and a tendency to buy lower-priced, older models. He also believes that ""long-term growth opportunities related to India, services, the enterprise, artificial intelligence, and maybe even the cloud still exist;"" however, he does not ""expect these potential 'what's next?' opportunities to emerge as major needle movers over the next 12 months for Apple's model.""  He therefore downgraded the shares from overweight to sector weight.Ford Snaps Up Apple Executive: Musa Tariq, Apple's global marketing and communications director for retail, is joining Ford as its chief brand officer. Tariq's experience includes initiatives to enhance the retail experience at Apple's 490 stores. As Ford evolves as a company making vehicles in a self-driving world, it will be increasingly blending technology and auto, so it's easy to see that the brand might need repositioning. Steering the company through these changes seems to be the role Tariq will play.Ajit Pai Is FCC Chairman: Net neutrality opposer Ajit Pai has been appointed Chairman of the FCC by the Trump administration. Pai was one of two Republicans on the five-member board, so his elevation won't require senate approval. He replaces Tom Wheeler, who resigned soon after Trump won the elections. Streaming companies like Netflix, Apple and Amazon won't be too pleased although Netflix indicated that its fan following provided it a certain amount of leverage with carriers. The truth is, it already has arrangements with carriers that allow them to charge it differential rates, contrary to the principles of net neutrality.Facebook Gets New VR Chief: Facebook has made an important hire in Hugo Barra, who has spent the last three years revving up the marketing machinery at Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones are attributed to him) and serving as Google's Android chief before that. Facebook's VR plan is more on the high end, which has somewhat impacted the adoption of the Rift, so it's easy to see how it could benefit from experience.Barra will replace Brendan Iribe as Oculus head and will also head up all VR efforts at Facebook. Iribe will move to the PC division, to speed up PC-based VR development. As part of his recent testimony defending Oculus technology, Zuckerberg said earlier that VR will take five to ten years to go mainstream and that Facebook will probably have to spend another $3 billion before it gets where it wants to go. So it clearly has long range plans.Microsoft to Invest $1 Billion in Cloud Security: Microsoft has said that it will continue to invest a billion dollars into cloud security over the next few years and some say this is excluding acquisitions (such as Aorato for enterprise security, Adallom for general cloud security applications, and Secure Islands, for protection of data and files) and investments through its venture capital arm.The adoption of cloud infrastructure by enterprises to a great extent hinges on the security of offerings. This along with the far greater competition in the cloud than in desktop computing makes security very important for Microsoft. Since the company now has a synchronized operating system across platforms in windows 10, it can hope to bring increasingly secure offerings and thereby pick up market share.Microsoft Bond Sale: Soon after raising $19.75 billion in bonds in Aug 2016, Microsoft sold another $17 billion worth. The seven-part offering will be used for general corporate purposes and to help repay $26 billion in short term debt used to acquire LinkedIn.Moody's assigned a Aaa rating to the issue on the basis of a business model that will remain exceptionally robust as it continues to transition from on premise licensing to cloud based software subscription and service offerings. Investors haven't taken bond issues by tech companies badly because it's well known that they have huge cash piles parked overseas. The practice may change going forward if tax reform brings more of this cash back home.Microsoft Creates CTO Position: Kevin Scott, former SVP of infrastructure and operations at LinkedIn, will fill the newly created position of chief technology officer at Microsoft to push adoption of Microsoft products and services at LinkedIn customers and members. He will report directly to CEO Nadella. Scott previously worked at Google and AdMob.Nadella Joins Starbucks Board: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will join Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer and LEGO Brand Group executive chairman Jørgen Vig Knudstorp on Starbucks' board of directors, if the shareholders approve the appointments at the annual general meeting in March. The appointments will expand the size of the board from 12 to 14 as long-time director Jamie Shennan will retire before the meeting.Snap IPO Reveals Google Cloud Deal: Inside documents filed by Snap was a deal with Google to use its cloud computing platform to run the Snapchat app; not just that, there is a minimum purchase agreement of $400 million a year, although in the first four years, up to 15% may be moved to a subsequent year. Snap doesn't make a whole lot of money just yet, (just $404.5 million in 2016) but its service is very popular and using Google's cloud could help it scale.Google Is Top Brand Again: Brand Finance, one of the firms providing a list of leading brands, says that Google has claimed the top position for the first time in 5 years, replacing Apple. Google's strength is seen in its prowess in search, which is the mainstay of its advertising business and where it remains ""largely unchallenged"". Apple is seen as repeatedly underperforming expectations and its inability to ""demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline"".Google Hires VR Employee: Just a few months after Google launched its Daydream View VR headset (basic features and head strap packed into a stylish package that retails for just $49), the company has hired away Claude Zellweger, who headed HTC's VR unit. Zellweger led the team responsible for the Vive VR headset, so this is probably an indication that Google has big VR hardware plans.Alibaba Leading Funding Round in India's Paytm: Alibaba is leading a $200 million funding round in Paytm Ecommerce, which was spun out of One97 Communications. One97 also offers the Paytm Digital Wallet, in which Alibaba and its financial arm own a high stake. Alibaba is not entering the Indian ecommerce market directly at this stage but through startups like this one and Snapdeal. Other big players include Amazon and Flipkart.Activision's Consumer Products Division: Activision has created a division to make more out of its popular video games and has appointed Tim Kilpin former president and chief commercial officer of Mattel, to head the unit. Activision's goal is to develop consumer-type products based on its video game franchises (toys and apparel for example) so Kilpin, with his experience developing the hugely popular ""Monster High"" dolls (Mattel's first intellectual property in more than 30 years) will come in handy.Legal/RegulatoryFacebook Fined in Oculus Case: A jury has decided that ZeniMax will receive $500 million from Oculus owner Facebook as it was guilty of copyright infringement, the failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement, and for the misuse of Oculus trademarks. The amount to be paid is split up as follows: $200 million for violating a non-disclosure agreement, $50 million for copyright infringement and $50 million for improper use of ZeniMax trademarks.It will also pick up $150 million in damages from Brendan Iribe and $50 million in damages from Palmer Luckey, the two Oculus co-founders. However, the court ruled that the Rift maker wasn't guilty of trade secret theft, a point that will be used by Oculus to frame its appeal.Google Privacy Policy Under EU Scrutiny: Google made a significant change to its privacy policy back in June. The change, while enabling users to more easily see and delete the information that Google has on them, also alters Google's age-old policy to separate data on Gmail and YouTube from its widely used DoubleClick business. The change therefore empowers Google to build better customer profiles and thereby serve more targeted ads. Oracle, which is part of a coalition called Fairsearch that tries to make life as difficult as possible for Google, brought it to the attention of regulators last year and they are now looking into the matter.Amazon Would Rather Settle with EU: Amazon's parity clause that forced ebook publishers to always offer it the same terms as rival platforms has been under EU scrutiny. The investigation started in Jun 2015 with the goal of determining whether the facility prevented other distributors from competing with Amazon by offering new and innovative products and services. Now that the EU has opened it up for feedback from rivals and customers, Amazon is attempting to settle the matter with publishers so it isn't called upon to pay a fine, which could be as high as 10% of its global turnover.New Technology/ProductsApple Watch Patent: Apple has won a patent for a modular metal band for its Watch. The modules can be used to house batteries, haptic devices that provide a sensation to the user, displays, photovoltaic cells, cameras, GPS sensors, speakers and a range of health sensors including thermometers, hygrometers, blood pressure sensors and sweat sensors. The limited space in the wearable to serve individual customer needs was the reason for developing the band.Apple Mac Chip Could Hurt Intel Business: Both Boomberg's Mark Gurman and Ian King and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani have given views on how an Apple developed co-processor(codenamed T310 for Macs based on ARM technology can hurt Intel's chip business. According to Bloomberg, the Apple chip, which went into development last year, will gradually take over the functions of the Intel processor, paving the way for Apple's processor independence.But chips generally take 3-4 years to get into mass production, so Daryanani's view that it will not impact Intel's business in 2017 and also possibly in 2018 makes sense. He says that if Intel is totally designed out, it will be a $2-3 billion hit to annual revenue, $750 million to $1 billion hit to operating income with a 12-16 cent impact on the annual EPS.Intel Go: Intel is boosting its automotive efforts by creating a new division called Intel Go to solve hardware problems like computer vision, infotainment, 5G wireless connectivity and AI technology. It will also offer related software solutions. Intel holds the view that the car is the next computing hub and it intends to do all it can to grab a greater dollar share. As cars incorporate more electronics and move towards complete automation, Intel's innovations, partnerships and investments may be expected to put it in front and center of the new opportunity as it unfolds.Google Instant Apps: First announced at the 2016 Google I/O conference, Instant Apps are a workaround between full apps and the web. Single-use or infrequently-used apps sometimes have to be downloaded because the mobile web browsers of companies aren't that great. Since unnecessary downloads are nothing but wasted memory and space, Google will stream parts of the apps from its own servers, so neither the download nor the mobile web is required. The company is now rolling out the service to select users.Slack's Answer to Microsoft: The Slack Enterprise Grid designed for larger and more complex businesses offers identity management technology, data loss prevention and advanced security systems. The Slack solution is also compliant with regulatory requirements in healthcare and finance sectors, which may be partly responsible for its swelling user base.The company said that it now has 1.5 million paying users, which is commendable since it doesn't offer many other computing building blocks that rival Microsoft does. In Nov 2016, Microsoft announced Teams, which connected the chat feature with the Office 365 cloud suite, thereby facilitating collaboration. The two are now competing head-on.M&A and CollaborationsCisco Buys AppDynamics: Cisco paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics, an application performance management company just before it was scheduled to float its IPO. The purchase price was more than double the amount the company hoped to raise at its IPO and almost double the $1.9 billion valuation at its last funding round. Cisco has been trying to build the software and services side of the business, with particular focus on the emerging Internet of Things. The acquisition will surely provide the ""end to end visibility and intelligence from the network through the application"" that it is looking for and could nudge up software revenue from the current 29%, but the price tag looks high.Alibaba Affiliate Buys MoneyGram: Alibaba's payments arm Ant Financial is buying Nasdaq-listed MoneyGram for $880 million. MoneyGram focuses on peer-to-peer transactions and includes cross-border currency transfers. It also claims to have 350K physical locations across 200 countries. Ant Financial handles nearly 90% of digital payments in China and has also made strategic investments in India-based Paytm as part of its international push. MoneyGram will go a long way in furthering this objective.Some NumbersApple Watch Market Share: According to Strategy Anlaytics, Apple sold 5.2 million Apple Watch devices in the fourth quarter of 2016, slightly higher than 5.2 million units in the year-ago quarter, grabbing a 63% share of the market. Samsung was second with a 10% share, or 800K units (it sold 1.3 million units a year ago).Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock May Get Snapped After Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been getting bullish withTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), as the stock has climbed about 13% so far on the year. As usual, there have been the various buyout rumors, which have probably accounted for quite a bit of the gain.makeArticleAd();Source:Andreas Eldh via FlickrYet might all this be another example of over eagerness with Twitter stock? Perhaps there will just be more disappointment when the company reports its earnings on Thursday?Well, the good news is that the bar is not set too high. The Street is expecting for Twitter earnings to come to 12 cents a share (on an adjusted basis) and revenues to hit $740.1 million.By comparison,last yearthe company reported profits of 16 cents a share and a top-line of $710 million.In other words, the consensus is for the revenues to grow by a mere 4.2%, which would represent the slowest ramp since TWTR became a public company. To put this into perspective,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)generateda massive $8.6 billion in revenues in Q4, up a sizzling 53%. So is it any wonder that Twitter stock has been mostly a bad investment?7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialOf course not.Now, in terms of the quarter, TWTR stock could benefit from some catalysts. Some of those include the impact of the holiday season as well as the wild presidential election and the live-streaming of NFL games.But such things will likely be temporary for Twitter stock. The fact is that the lackluster user growth will probably continue to weigh on the company. For example, Cantor's Youssef Squali isforecastingonly a 2 million net monthly active user increase in the base to 319 million, up 4.6%. This would be roughly the same as Q3's growth rate.But none of this should be a surprise. TWTR has been beset with frequent turnover in the executive ranks. It also does not help that the CEO, Jack Dorsey, spends time as the head ofSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ).Hey, do Zuckerberg orSnap'sEvan Spiegel side gigs? No, because they realize that the online world is brutally competitive.Bottom Line on Twitter StockActually, the Snap IPO may put even more pressure on Twitter stock. Investors will soon have another high-growth play to put their money into. As a result, TWTR stock will become more marginalized.Now. Dorsey has talked about improving the service and making it easier to use. But so far, the actions have fallen flat. Granted, at the start of the New Year, he asked users for feedback. Yet much of it was kind of vague. Instead, users would rather spend their time on platforms like FB, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. It's that simple. For the most part, TWTR has failed to keep up with the latest trends, such as with chat and video.Unfortunately, when a consumer tech company gets into this situation, it is tough to turn things around. Just look at classic examples likeYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) andAOL. They spent years trying to find ways to juice up user numbers - but nothing seemed to work.Part of this is that the brand quickly loses its luster. But there is something else: resources start to dwindle as cash flows drop.In fact, both seem to be issues with Twitter stock. If anything, the brand appears kind of crusty and is also associated with harassment and bullying. Oh, and in terms of the core operations, the company has been reducing the workforce and unloading various segments, such as the recent sale ofFabrictoAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)The likely end-game for TWTR stock, of course, is a sale of the company. But of course, the problem there is that when the company put itself up on the block last year, there was little interest.This does not means things are absolutely hopeless. There are certainly investment opportunities with TWTR stock - but they are probably mostly short-term trades.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Amazon's Next Major Growth Driver Takes Another Step Forward;2/7/2017;"It's anchors aweigh forAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , and investors should be cheering the e-commerce   giant's latest move.Amazon recently passed a major milestone in its continued   effort to disrupt the global shipping and logistics industry,   long dominated by partners includingFedEx(NYSE: FDX) ,UPS(NYSE: UPS) , and numerous others. Equally important, this   achievement illustrates why many, myself included, believe   Amazon's best days lie ahead of it, despite a lofty market   capitalization already in the hundreds of billions of   dollars.Amazon launches a logistics serviceAccording to a number of credible reports, Amazon recently   began operating as a ""global freight forwarder and logistics   provider,"" pushing the e-commerce giant into a new line of   business. This doesn't mean Amazon owns or rents any seagoing   vessels (yet). Rather, it acts as the liaison that helps   manufacturers book space on freight ships and move products   between ports and warehouses.makeArticleAd();Source: Getty Images.The e-commerce giant is currently doing so under the name of   one of its Chinese subsidiaries, and Amazon has reportedly   provided this service for at least 150 cargo containers thus far.   This small figure is too small to be viewed even as a rounding   error for the global shipping industry -- the Port of Los Angeles   alone processed about 800,000 containers in December 2016 alone,   for example -- but the move represents an important symbolic   achievement for Amazon. It marks just the latest step in Amazon's   apparent long-term ambition to create some type of global   logistics and delivery platform.Recall that early last year, Amazon signed adeal to lease20Boeing767s as part of its partnership withAir Transport Services Group, an agreement that also saw Amazon make a minority investment in   the company as well. This move served as the opening salvo in a   new chapter that pits Amazon directly against many longtime   partners, such as UPS and FedEx, to name a few. Such a seemingly   far-flung tactic might seem like something of a distraction to   outside observers, but investors should love this latest news --   and the broader storyline -- for a number of reasons.Turning water into profitsIt's quite likely that the financial opportunity alone makes   this service an attractive idea for Amazon. All told, the global   shipping and logistics business could be worth $400   billion, according to one research analyst. At the same   time, though, this story is also worth noting because it reflects   Amazon's unique ability to transform parts of its cost structure   into new revenue streams.Retail is an infamously low-margin business, and consumers   typically favor the company that offers the lowest prices for   undifferentiated goods -- people don't care from whom they buy   their batteries. To gain market share, then, Amazon has been   forced to find ways to continually charge less than its   competition for the goods it sells. Thisconstant searchfor ways to lower prices, in turn, has forced Amazon to find ways   to lower its own cost structure to make its business model   sustainable.To so do, Amazon has been remarkably aggressive in creating   new services from the core competencies it has gained. Among some   noteworthy examples are its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing   platform and its Fulfillment by Amazon service. Each of these   services allows Amazon to generate additional revenue by using   its own infrastructure and intellectual capital to help solve   similar problems at other companies.By turning its attention to global logistics and related   services, Amazon seemingly hopes to shave even more from its own   burgeoning shipping and fulfillment bills. According to its most   recent annual report (2015), fulfillment costs were Amazon's   largest operating cost, accounting for 12.5% of total revenue.   Fulfillment costs as a percentage of sales had also increased in   each of the past two years. Scaling this new service could lead   to billions in cost savings for Amazon, which would allow it to   lower prices in its e-commerce business in a virtuous cycle that   benefits customers and shareholders alike over the long term.Of course, disrupting a global industry as large as logistics   and fulfillment will take years, and there are any number of   reasons Amazon's vision might not come to fruition. As a   potential boon to its sales growth strategy and as an interesting   case study in terms of its broader business philosophy, this is   indeed a storyline worth watching as it continues to play out in   the years to come.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Is Advertising Amazon's Next Big Growth Product?;2/7/2017;"In digital advertising there areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one   company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two   ad behemoths:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an   advertiser.Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or   the bigAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only   300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping   data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be   able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google   despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks   louder than how people spend their money.Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();What's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so   quickly?During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric   Sheridan asked about the ""other"" line item on Amazon's income   statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum   over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in   advertising.The other category includes ""certain advertising services and   our co-branded credit card agreements,"" according to Amazon's   quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card   offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002   and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the   category is probably coming from advertising.And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North   America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the   fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of   revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service,   Amazon Web Services.Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just   1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's   still working on a very small revenue base.Expanding its ad productsMost of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search   results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored   products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the   top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising.   Management described sponsored products as ""off to a great   start,"" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion.A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online   shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and   more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show.   In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away   from Google, which is whyEric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest   competitorin 2014.But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own   websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it   developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows   publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of   wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent   one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer   algorithms.)Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the   complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers,   enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other   header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated   the space that header bidding threatens.As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user   data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook   or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising   products on third-party websites, it could start to take a   significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google   generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members'   websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1   billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company   hasn't provided any updates since then.The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion   worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That   number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can   grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it   could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Can Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Win in Groceries?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) grocery strategy is confusing. Last year, theWall Street Journalpublished a stunning report that the company was planning to open 2,000 physical grocery stores. Such a move which would have made it one of the largest operators in the country, in league withKroger Co's(NYSE:KR) 2,778 locations,Albertson's2,205 stores and the 2,000 markets owned byAhold-Delhaize(OTCMKTS:ADRNY), corporate parent of Stop-N-Shop and Food Lion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA few days later, AMZN stock, which is known for being secretive and didn't comment on theJournal'soriginal report, released a statement indicating that it did not have plans to open ""2,000 of anything. Not even close.""Then it cryptically added: ""We are still learning."" For its part, theJournalstuck to its story, adding that the Seattle-based company could open 2,000 grocery stores ""depending on how its trials go.""This raises the question over whether Amazon might open more stores. It is test marketing Amazon Go, a neighborhood market that enables shoppers to make purchases without going through a checkout line. It also is thinking of adding larger format concepts, the newspaper added.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatBefore getting too excited about AMZN stock over this particular initiative - especially in the wake of slightlydisappointing fourth-quarter earnings- investors need to keep a few things in mind.Fighting the Grocery BusinessFirst, the grocery business has been the Bermuda Triangle for some of the biggest names in retail, such asWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT)andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which have struggled for years in the low-margin business. The higher-end of the grocery market has stagnated as evidenced by the declining profits atWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM). I don't know how Amazon will fare any better.Indeed, according to eMarketer, AmazonFresh online grocery delivery service trials rivals Peapod, Fresh Direct and Instacart because it started later. Peapod is owned by Royal Ahold Delhaize, has been around for 20 years. AmazonFresh sales have been surging lately because the e-commerce giant has slashed fees. This is a familiar strategy from the Amazon playbook of sacrificing profit for revenue growth. Local grocers are offering delivery as well.Amazon Go could be a potential game changer if it works. That's a big ""if"" because if the technology doesn't work the company's profits will walk out the door - literally.Even if Amazon Go can eliminate the need for cashiers, it may make more sense for the company to license the technology rather than open physical stores.Furthermore, the incumbent grocery chains haven't been the pushovers that some pundits had expected. Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced its peers over the past 10 years and the chain sees ""$100-plus billion in market share growth opportunities"" in its existing markets. DiscounterAldihas been taking market share from bigger rivals including Walmart. Kantar Retail expects the German company's annual U.S. sales to reach $20 billion fueled by a 33% jump in stores to 2,000.Buying Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock? Wait for a PullbackAmazon.com, though, remains a dangerous competitor because it is swimming in cash thanks to the surge in its web services business. It can take all the time that it needs to ""figure out"" the vexing challenges posed by the grocery business. That's why it's best to avoid shares of the grocers along with other traditional retailers who are being strangled by the costs of running stores by AMZN.The company's grocery gambit, however, isn't reason enough to buy AMZN stock.As of this writing, Johnathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This Quarter3 Healthcare Tickers That Will Return Profits in 3 MonthsThe postCan Amazon.com, Inc.

12 Wild Metrics Behind Amazon.com Inc.'s Profit-Surging 2016;2/7/2017;"In 2016,Amazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) business surged as the company proved its   ability to not only rake in higher profits, but to hit a level of   profitability far beyond what investors would have imagined even   just a few years ago. With the company'sfourth-quarter earnings releasefor 2016 finally behind it, it's a good time to reflect on   Amazon's crushing performance last year.Here's Amazon's 2016 in 12 must-see metrics:Total revenue increased 27%, driven by growth in Amazon's e-commerce and cloud-computing   businesses. This brought total revenue to about $136 billion.makeArticleAd();Image source: Amazon.Operating income nearly doubled, increasing from $2.2 billion in 2015 to $4.2 billion in   2016.Net income skyrocketed 302%, increasing from $596 million, or $1.25 per share, to about $2.4   billion, or $4.90 per share.Amazon's total e-commerce revenue increased 25%,accounting for 91% of the company's total revenue during the   year. North America represented 64% of Amazon's e-commerce sales   and the company's international geographic segment captured the   remaining 36%.Amazon's international e-commerce sales growth rate   accelerated to 24%, up from year-over-year growth of 6% in 2015. This uptick in   overseas e-commerce sales growth vouches for Amazon's big   international investments, suggesting the company can scale its   key international market and turn its losses into profits in the   coming years.Amazon's global e-commerce operating income increased   48%, driven entirely by fast-rising profitability in North America   and partially offset by a widening operating loss in the   company's international business as Amazon invested aggressively   overseas. Amazon's North America e-commerce segment's operating   income increased from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion and the   company's international e-commerce operating loss worsened from a   loss of about $700 million to a loss of $1.3 billion.Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue jumped 55%, from about $7.9 billion to $12.2 billion. The segment now   accounts for approximately 9% of total annual revenue, up from 7%   in 2015.AWS operating income surged 106%, from $1.5 billion to $3.1 billion. The rapid rise in AWS   operating profits reinforced the segment's importance to the   company and its critical place in any investing thesis for the   stock. AWS represented an impressive 74% of Amazon's total   operating profits, up from 67% of operating profits in 2015.AWS released 1,017 new services and features during the   year, accelerating its pace of innovation from 722 launches in   2015.Items available for 2-day Prime shipping increased 73%     year over year.Image source: Amazon.Prime members' engagement with Amazon's digital content   more than doubledas the company invested aggressively in its flywheel of benefits   for members, ramping up its video, music, and reading offerings   during the year.Amazon's Prime Video expanded to 200 new countries and     territories.With Amazon stock rising about 30% since just before the   e-commerce giant reported its results for the first quarter of   2016 to just after the company reported its fourth quarter   results for the year, investors are obviously pleased with   Amazon's ability to grow profits and boost profits. In 2017,   investors should look for both of these trends to continue as   Amazon's e-commerce reach grows and the company's cash-cow AWS   segment continues to dominate in cloud computing.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen investors think of a company that's leveraging its strong online presence to cultivate an offline presence,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). And well it should. What used to be nothing more than an e-commerce outfit is now doing everything from groceries to cloud services to a brick-and-mortar bookstore, and more. Consumers love it.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd yet, when one takes a step back and takes an unbiased assessment of e-tailers that are increasingly making omnichannel work for them,Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) deserves a look.Indeed, given the company's fiscal metrics, BABA stock is arguably the better, more potent pick of the two names.BABA Stock Has a Little Bit of EverythingWhile most investors broadly recognize Alibaba has been getting into several online and offline businesses, most investors - perhaps even most owners of BABA stock - likely don't realize just how deep it has waded into untraditional waters.Since early 2015, Alibaba has partially or wholly acquired smartphone makerMeizu, online movie-ticket agentYueke, online video venueYouku Tudou, food delivery nameEle.me, media companySCMP Group, ride-hailing companyDidi Chuxing, lottery service providerAGTech Holdings, Android app storeWandoujia, grocerRedmartand most recently, its Ant Financial subsidiary announced itsplans to acquire fintech outfitMoneyGram.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialAlibaba stock is NOT just an e-commerce name anymore.Perhaps more important, whatever it is in China, like Amazon.com in the western world, it doesn't face any significant competition in its primarily Asian market. One could argueJD.Com Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:JD) is a threat, but JD remains persistently unprofitable, and simply can't muscle its way to more market share the way Alibaba can. One way or another,one of those new hot spots looks like it's going to be the United States.It raises the question though … is Alibaba equipped to take on Amazon at the same time it has got so many other balls in the air?Actually, yeah, it is.Alibaba Is Self-Funded and Well-FundedThere's no denying CEO Jack Ma has been uncomfortably aggressive at times in spreading the company's footprint. It has paid off though, asthe company's business of e-commerceis not only offsetting the losses incurred by all of its other ancillary businesses, but it's keeping the company surprisingly more profitable than Amazon is.The specifics: Over the course of the past twelve months, Alibaba has produced profit margins of 26.7%, while Amazon has cleared a little less than 2% of revenue as net earnings for the same timeframe. In numeric terms, Alibaba has banked $5.6 billion worth of net income over the past four quarters, versus Amazon's $2.1 billion.And that's more or less been the norm for a while.Yes, there is more to the story. There always is. One can't simply explain away that kind of profitability disparity though.Analysts are becoming believers too, particularly following last quarter's revenue growth of 54% and the company's earnings beat. Alibabaearned $1.30 per share, versus estimates of only $1.13 per share of BABA stock. Goldman Sachs analystsrecently wrote:""We raise our Fiscal year 2017-2019 revenue estimates by 3-4% on better growth outlook for China online advertising and International retail, and raise our earnings per share estimates by 5-7% due to higher operating leverage. Our 12-month sum-of-the-parts-based target price increases 2% to $131 after incorporating forecast changes and mark to market of listed investments. At $101, core retail is valued at 13x estimated fiscal 2019 earnings. Reiterate conviction-list Buy rating. Key risks: slower GMV [gross merchandise value] growth, lower monetization, more intense competition.""Goldman's take effectively echoes most pros' opinions right now. Even analysts that aren't quite as optimistic about the company's expansion into non-e-commerce waters don't dislike Alibaba. Cantor Fitzgerald's Youssef Squalirecently noted:""Ambitious foray into 'New Retail' could pressure margins in core retail. While Alibaba's ownership of Intime, a leading department store operator, broadens its opportunity in retail through omni-channel commerce, we note that the move carries execution risks and is likely to erode margins in core retail.""Squali was so worried that he upped his price target on Alibaba stock from $115 to $120,Bottom Line for BABA StockIt might be hyperbole to say Alibaba has out-Amazoned Amazon, though it would be more than fair to say BABA stock has done a better job than AMZN in terms of cost-containment.Regardless, as difficult as further penetrating the North American market may prove to Jack Ma, Alibaba may end up doing more with its brick-and-mortar businesses in China than Amazon does with its physical presences here in the United States.Newmont Mining Corp (NEM) Stock Has More Gains to ComeHow so? As much as Americans love and live for their smartphones, Chinese smartphone owners use them more, anduse them for more things central to the offline living of life. Alibaba's other ventures all contribute to the idea that, like Amazon, it's morphing from an e-commerce powerhouse to a lifestyle company.More important, the plan is working. If there was any doubt BABA stock is the real deal, it's being wiped away, while Amazon's paper-thin margins and debt are increasingly getting in its way.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This Quarter9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Stocks Projected to More Than Double Their Earnings in 2017;2/7/2017;"Image Source: Getty ImagesWho says big can't be beautiful? In the year ahead, some of   the world's largest tech companies are set to grow their earnings   at triple-digit rates, such as these:makeArticleAd();Company NameMarket CapitalizationEstimated Annual EPS GrowthAmazon.com$384.4 billion283.3%Netflix$59.3 billion154.6%Micron Technology$23.9 billion3,932.4%Data source: S&P Global Market IntelligenceThis kind of dramatic rise in earnings can result from several   different factors, some more positive than others. Let's examine   the specific earnings growth stories under way atAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) to gain a clearer sense of whether investors should   further consider these three high-growth tech stocks.Amazon.comIt's uncommon to find a company sporting a valuation of   several hundred billion dollars more than double its profit, but   this is just one example of how e-commerce leader Amazon.com   defies convention. Amazon's profit growth is in many ways a   result of the company's well-worn tactic of running its business   as close to breakeven as possible. A small profit base makes this   kind of performance far easier. The company produced only $252   million in net income from sales of $22.3 billion in revenue in   its most recently reported quarter, as the most recent   example.At the same time, its impressive profit growth speaks to the   compelling nature of Amazon's long-term growth opportunity, even   for a company well into its third decade of existence. As one of   the many data points to support this thesis, researcher eMarketer   predicts that worldwide retail e-commerce sales will increase   from $1.9 trillion in $4.1 trillion by 2020. As arguably themost innovative companyin the space, Amazon.com is well positioned to ride the   generational trend to continued growth for years to come.NetflixThe streaming-video giant has produced consistent, albeit   highly variable, GAAP profits in recent years. That figures to   change over the coming 12 months. Netflix has invested heavily to   launch its international streaming business, and the results thus   far have been impressive, to say the least. Better still, the   inherent operating leverage in Netflix's streaming business model   should truly shine through in the coming quarters, as its   international segment begins producing positive contribution   profits, a proxy for operating profit. Specifically, Netflix   expects to add 3.7 million net international subscribers in its   current quarter (Q1 2017), which should help bump its   international segment's contribution profit from a $67 million   loss in Q4 2016 to $16 million on the plus side in its current   quarter.The maturation of its international business appears largely   responsible for the company's EPS uptick this year; Netflix's   more mature U.S. operation is already highly profitable. This   trend also figures to continue into next year, when analysts see   Netflix's EPS growing a further 82% year over year. That being   said, Netflix's soaring stock price makes its shares painfully   expensive, at 68 times its expected 2017 earnings. However, as a   best-of-breed growth stock, Netflix may indeed deserve the   premium, as its triple-digit earnings growth showcases.Micron TechnologiesExplaining Micron's place on the list requires a bit of   context. A supply glut in the memory chip market in 2015    and 2016 hit Micron, which derives virtually all of its   revenue from selling memory chips, into a full-year loss for   2016. The sharp contrast between Micron's most recent two years   speaks for itself.Metric20152016Micron revenue$16.1 billion$12.4 billionMicron net income$2.9 billion($276 million)Diluted Micron EPS$2.71($0.27)Data source: Micron Technology investor relations.Now, in the new year, this trend is widely expected to reverse   itself and then some, which has had a dramatic effect on Micron's   2017 sales and earnings estimates , as evidenced by its   triple-digit EPS growth this year. The company's stock price has   reacted in kind, soaring 119% over the past 12 months. Lending   the pricing rebound narrative further credence, stronger memory   chip prices have already shown themselves throughout the   industry. In fact, favorable memory chip pricing helped fuel   market-share leaderSamsung's recent surprise earnings blowout, , even as the impact of   the Galaxy Note 7 recall hampered results.Importantly, though, Micron's reliance on memory chips gives   it something of a ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" dynamic.   Flush periods like today can prove tremendously lucrative for the   company and its shareholders, but its stock can also sell off   dramatically when memory chip prices soften. This isn't   necessarily a negative, but investors need to understand this   important dynamic to successfully invest in Micron Technology.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Fretting over Trump's Policies? 5 Safe Value Bets;2/7/2017;"Though the earnings season is at its peak, President Donald Trump has been keeping investors busy elsewhere. Investors keenly await clarification on the timing and scope of Trump's business-friendly policies and how the administration will balance tax cuts and infrastructure outlays with protectionist trade policies. The President has also acted promptly on executive orders ranging from a temporary immigration ban to the withdrawal from landmark trade pacts.Investors, in the meantime, also assign greater risk premiums to European countries where anti-establishment movements are gaining traction ahead of elections. Amid such apprehensions, it will be wise to invest in value stocks. Value investors look for times of uncertainty to pick stocks at a discount, which are fundamentally stable.Travel Ban Triggers UncertaintyTrump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban. German chancellor Angela Merkel said that it is ""not justified to put people from a specific background or faith under general suspicion"", while French president Francois Hollande said that ""withdrawal into oneself is a dead-end response"".Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Such an executive order on immigration, widely known as the ""Muslim Ban"", is being met with resistance by an increasing number of major tech firms.Tech giants Microsoft CorporationMSFTand Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNhave taken legal action against the executive order as they face obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Tim Cook, Apple Inc.'sAAPLCEO in an email sent to staff said that Trump's order ""is not a policy we support"". He added that ""diversity makes our team stronger"". In fact, 97 tech giants including Alphabet IncGOOGL, Facebook IncFBand Netflix, Inc.NFLXfiled a joint legal brief in protest of Trump's immigration ban.Alphabet, promptly, created a $2 million crisis fund for four campaigning organizations such as American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and UNHCR, while Sundar Pichai its CEO said that ""it's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues"".Trade War Could Hit EconomyInvestors, in the meanwhile, may ignore Trump's trade rhetoric at their own peril. The administration's pledge to protect U.S. industries and redefine currency relationships could lead to a trade war with dire consequences, eventually sparking a sell-off. In order to put ""America First"", Trump may retreat from global trade sending exporter's currency plummeting, curbing corporate revenues and destroying consumption.Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is mulling over the imposition of a border tax on imports. The administration had accused China, Mexico, Germany and Japan of keeping their currencies weak to gain trade advantages, which is irking even those who were bullish after the election.Caution Spreads Amid Geopolitical RisksWhile a highly polarized political environment and Trump's confrontational approach are expected to fuel volatility in the market, investors are also preparing for political upheavals across Europe including French and German elections later this year.French Socialist Member of Parliament and supporters have started to break ranks with their party after the primary election win of leftwing presidential nominee Benoît Hamon, offering support to independent candidate Emmanuel Macron. In Germany, Martin Schulz is to run as the Social Democrat candidate for chancellor after Sigmar Gabriel turned down the chance to oppose Angela Merkel in parliamentary election.5 Top Value Stocks to Buy NowIn a sign of how large the President's policies loom over the market, an analysis of FactSet data shows that one out of four companies were anxious about Trump's policies during their most recent earnings conference calls. Add to this more political disorder across Europe and we all know why investing in value stocks is judicious.Value investors look at uncertain times as opportunities to pick up financial sound stocks at a discount.  Such companies are well-established to do business even in the worst of times and are protected against market vagaries.Successful investors like Warren Buffett also recommend choosing stocks that are momentarily underpriced compared to the underlying value of the company, especially in an investment climate marked by skeptical investor behavior.Thanks to our newstyle score system, we have been able to identify five solid value stocks.

Peek Under The Hood: RTH Has 12% Upside;2/7/2017;"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe atETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Retail ETF (Symbol: RTH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $84.82 per unit.With RTH trading at a recent price near $76.07 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.50% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RTH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Amazon.com Inc. (Symbol: AMZN), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (Symbol: WBA), and Dollar General Corp (Symbol: DG). Although AMZN has traded at a recent price of $807.64/share, the average analyst target is 15.81% higher at $935.33/share. Similarly, WBA has 15.67% upside from the recent share price of $80.80 if the average analyst target price of $93.46/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DG to reach a target price of $83.12/share, which is 15.04% above the recent price of $72.26.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Which Commercial Won the Super Bowl?;2/7/2017;"During last night's Super Bowl,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ: NFLX) released a 30-second teaser trailer for the highly   anticipated second season of its surprise summer hitStranger Things. With an estimated average cost of $5 million dollars for a   30-second commercial, this was a big gamble for Netflix.   Advertisers tend to bring their A game, but not everyone gets   their money's worth. Consumer reactions can be hard to   anticipate.Stranger Things season 2 trailer created the most buzz among     Super Bowl ads. Image source: Netflix, Inc.makeArticleAd();And the winner is...It looks like Netflix strategy paid off.

The ad generated 307,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and   11:00 p.m. eastern time, which corresponds with the time the game   aired. That was three times more tweets than the next company,   and the total was more than the next three combined. Its success   is being corroborated by Media Life Magazine, which is reporting   that the trailer created 479.9 million social impressions, the   most for of any ad.PlaceT-Mobile US, Inc.(NASDAQ: TMUS) , took the second spot, with 91,700 tweets. This   was a much more expensive proposition for the company, as it   bought more than three full minutes of ad time.Its advertisements   featured a variety of celebrities including Justin Bieber, rapper   Snoop Dogg with home-making maven Martha Stewart, and comedienne   Kristen Schaal, all promoting its unlimited data plan. As the   number three carrier, T-Mobile is keen to gain ground against   competitorsVerizonandAT&T.And showThe Procter & Gamble Company(NYSE: PG) made a surprise appearance in third place with 80,800   tweets for its Mr. Clean ad, which depicts the ""sexy"" version of   its animated character dancing while cleaning a woman's house.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Still Finding Growth;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NYSE:MSFT) used to be a one-trick, maybe two-trick pony less than 10 years ago. My how things have changed.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Under founder Bill Gates, DOS and then Windows operating systems were on virtually every computer that wasn't anApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) machine. And that dominance continued unabated until the dotcom bubble burst.It wasn't the ensuing crash that hurt, it was the fact that tech had reached a point of inflection.From then on, it wasn't just about owning a fiber-optic switching company with a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. One of the sayings from those heady times was, if it doesn't have a triple digit P/E, it's not worth buying.The crash meant the internet and tech itself was growing up. There was plenty of consolidation that happened after the dotcom crash. Some worked out, some didn't. But it was necessary for companies that were going to survive to find a way to pivot into the new marketplace.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It was also around that time that Microsoft was embroiled in a major antitrust case with the U.S. Government. This meant that MSFT had to change on many levels, just to survive. It was crucial to find a way out of this, because most of the government computers were running Windows, and if Microsoft couldn't find a bright path through the case, it may well lose a very lucrative long-term contract.By 2006, Gates was out of day-to-day operations and his No. 2, Steve Ballmer, took over. While he started strong, it wasn't long until it was apparent that doing the same thing a little differently was not going to cut it as technology was expanding rapidly and interconnections were popping among different tech fields.In 2014, the current CEO, Satya Nadella, took the helm and began to completely reorganize the company, shedding unprofitable and unwieldy divisions and focusing on the future of the company. That meant cleaning up the mess created by the acquisition of the mobile phone business ofNokiaand building a robust cloud-based business for both operating systems and for client storage.It certainly helped that he was previously head of MSFT R&D. But some were still skeptical of his approach, especially in the early days, when the new divisions weren't getting much traction and the established businesses were left wanting - remember Windows 8?Now three years into his role, Nadella has gone from potential goat to real hero. And the most recent earnings number prove out his strategy. He has remained focused and disciplined, and it has paid off.Microsoft has committed $1 billion into cybersecurity investment for its services as well as R&D. The company is reporting 600,000 to 700,000 attacks a week, up from about 20,000 just three years ago. But it's not as much the threat as the opportunity. According to tech sitetechemergence.com, there's an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity market that will be worth $8.3 trillion market by 2035 in the U.S. alone.And given the fact that the U.S. government is one of MSFT stock's biggest clients, security is crucial.Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More PatienceGoing hand in hand with this is the impressive growth of Azure, Microsoft's cloud-based operating and storage system. Revenue growth year over year is running around 93% and Azure is getting big enough to compete with Amazon Web Services, the cloud division ofAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN).Recent earnings were solid overall and there's no reason to think MSFT stock has seen its best days already. And while its 30 P/E may look expensive, AMZN is trading at a P/E of 185. And MSFT also delivers a solid 2.4% dividend as well.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Pass This Turing Test?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFinancially and technically,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) seems to have everything going its way. Facebook's latest video announcements have it playinghardballagainstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) in the race to dominate the next generation of video. The company is rapidlyapproaching 2 billion usersin a world with 7 billion people.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook stock's fourth-quarter results were nothing short of awe-inspiring,as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli reported, net income rose 128% year-over-year, compared with 2015, as revenue rose 53%.The revenue run rate is still one-third that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), but the companies are competing ever-more fiercely for the same internet advertisers and, increasingly, FB is winning.So why is Facebook stock sitting below its 2017 high? Why did it rise only 2% on those incredible earnings? Why does FB stock seem stuck in first gear?Call it the perils of leadership.Facebook Stock and Political OppositionFacebook has become a mirror on the human condition, and civilization's ills have come calling on it.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialGangs are now waging theirturf warson the service. Its human decision-making is opaque, and people are being destroyed by thatwithout recourse.Worse, despite FB's insistence that it's not a media company, and that it is not political in any way, people are treating it as both.Many conservatives tied to the Trump Administrationnow count Facebook as an enemyandsuspect all those who work alongside it.This is happening even while FB goes to unprecedented lengths to fight terrorist propaganda,working alongside law enforcement and security agencies.The truth or falsehood of the political charges should be irrelevant to an investor. What matters is that Facebook is seen to be a media company, and seen to be a political actor, that it's being treated as such, and that responding to all this is expected to cost money, reducing margins and net income.Fortunately, FB stock has a way to fight back.FB Stock: A Turing TestFacebook stock is in a race against billions of people who want its network to pass a Turing Test. Its network must pretend to be human, and to act humanely, without using people to do it.Here are just some examples of what I'm talking about.FB must act againstfake news, phishing profilescreated by criminals, charges of political favoritism, plus millions of individual complaints about the actions of third parties,largeandsmall, in an automated fashion.This is because software scales in ways people cannot. If Facebook mustgo to court constantlyin order to protect itself, it can't continue to grow. It must automate its own self-policing, as with a recent patent application aimed atfighting a photo-tag spambot.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformAt the same time, FB stock must fight charges that its software is becoming bloated, denseand difficult to use.It must accept the increased complexity of video rights managementin this regard.It also must accept the fact thatmistakes will be made by softwareacting in human ways, just as people make mistakes.Fortunately, all I'm describing is a need for more artificial intelligence, and that happens to be the area in software where Facebook is putting a lot of its money right now.The company's recent delivery of a system for identifying the content of photos, andallowing them to be searched as text is searched, is just the tip of the iceberg for what's ahead for Facebook stock.By fighting for its own survival with artificial intelligence, FB stock is pointing the way to a futuredefined by artificial intelligence. This is less about creating an ""artificial assistant,"" like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, both advertised during last week's Super Bowl, and more about creating intelligence within the network so questions are answered before they are asked.If Facebook stock can succeed here, it can overcome both its own problems and a lot of yours, to mutual profit.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

After CEO Leaves, Tiffany & Co. Needs a Comeback for the Ages;2/6/2017;"Shares of luxury jewelerTiffany & Co.TIFslumped all day Monday, and closed the day down 2.45% to $78.49 per share after announcing that its CEO, Frederic Cumenal, was leaving the company, effective immediately.Tiffany said Chairman and former CEO Michael Kowalski will serve as interim CEO, and that the company's board of directors will begin the search for a successor with an executive search firm.""I am proud of what we have accomplished at Tiffany and would like to thank the management team and our many talented employees around the world with whom I have had the pleasure to work,"" said Cumenal. ""I have great confidence in Tiffany's brand, strategic direction and people, and I believe the company will have many exciting opportunities in the future.""Cumenal had been with Tiffany since 2011, moving quickly up the ranks at the jeweler and played a pivotal role in hiring design director Francesca Amfitheatrof, who was responsible for Tiffany's modern, popular ""T"" Collection. He was at French luxury conglomerate LVMH for 15 years before that, holding many roles in the company's wine and spirits divisionSlowing SalesDespite its icon status, Tiffany has been hard-pressed in recent years to remain an industry leader. You can place the blame on many things-changing markets in the U.S. and China, the strengthening of the dollar, the tightening of Chinese anti-corruption laws, and the overall slowdown of the ""hard-luxury"" market, i.e. diamonds-and each have contributed to slowing sales.The company's recent holiday quarter was particularly rough. For November and December combined, worldwide net revenues were $966 million, coming in above the $961 million reported a year ago. Worldwide comparable sales, however, declined 2%.In particular, sales at Tiffany's Flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York declined a whopping 14% year-over-year. The store sits right next to Trump Tower, and has been blocked in some way or form, with large numbers of protesters gathered outside, since the election of President Trump.A Carat-Sized ComebackA CEO departure never has the best timing for a company, and Cumenal's abrupt leave casts a long shadow on not just its Super Bowl ad, featuring none other than Lady Gaga, but also one of its key holiday sales periods, Valentine's Day. The ad introduces a new jewelry line that looks to be more edgy than Tiffany's typically classic pieces of jewelry.What Tiffany needs to do is to take a leap of faith like its new ad star did, whose new albumJoanneand acclaimed Super Bowl Halftimeperformancehelped jumpstart a stagnating music career. Maybe that means embracing new types of customers like the LBGTQ community and single women, who are, more and more, buying luxury jewelry for themselves. There's also huge demand for men's jewelry, watches, and accessories, and while Tiffany does have a large selection of men's items, the company could certainly offer more luxurious every day options.Tiffany would also see no harm in boosting its e-commerce presence, since online sales as a percentage of overall revenue haven't grown in three years, notesBloomberg. Maybe this means partnering with AmazonAMZNwith special deals on delivery during key holiday seasons like Thanksgiving-New Year's, Valentine's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, etc.If Tiffany continues to post little growth going forward, investors shouldn't be surprised if more management turnover at the company comes as a result. But if they committ to some change, Tiffany has a chance at being a jewelry leader once again.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Starbucks Says Its Biggest Problem Is Too Much Demand;2/6/2017;"Image source: Starbucks.A lot of people prefer to avoid any and all human contact   before getting their morning coffee, and that's a problem forStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) .makeArticleAd();Too many people are opting to use its mobile order and pay   system, which allows customers to order ahead on their app and   pick up their coffee in store -- no need to talk to anyone.   Management says the influx of mobile orders resulted in too much   congestion in stores, leading some walk-in customers to leave   before ordering. As a result, same-store sales grew a   disappointing 3%. That's its lowest level since 2009.Well, that escalated quicklyStarbucks just launched mobile order and pay during the first   fiscal quarter of 2015. It was seen as a way to relieve long   morning lines in stores. After rolling it out to every store in   the U.S. a year later, soon-to-be-CEO Kevin Johnson boasted, ""In   many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high,   mobile order and pay exceeds 10% of total transactions."" Just 13   stores saw 20% of orders during peak hours come from mobile order   and pay a year ago.By the fourth quarter of last year, mobile order and pay   accounted for 20% of orders during peak times at 600 stores. That   doubled to 1,200 stores in the first quarter.Starbucks wasn't prepared for the sudden surge in mobile   ordering. Without best practices in place, baristas were slowed   down by mobile orders while walk-ins lined up out the doors.   Meanwhile, mobile orderers struggled to pick up their own orders   because of congestion at the handoff plane. ""This congestion   resulted in some number of customers who either entered the store   or considered visiting a Starbucks store and then did not   complete a transaction,"" according to Johnson.Can Starbucks fix this?Management sounded very upbeat about the progress it's already   making tackling this issue during the earnings call. It's   implementing new tools and practices in the 1,000 stores with the   highest volume of mobile orders, including new roles and   resources specifically for mobile order & pay and text   message alerts for when orders are ready.But Starbucks' fiscal 2017 guidance may give some investors   pause. Management lowered revenue growth guidance to 8-10% from   the 10% growth guidance it provided a quarter earlier. It   still expects same-store sales growth to pick up in the second   half of the year, resulting in full-year same-store sales growth   in the mid-single-digits.If things don't start clearing up in the second quarter, with   a path to completely fixing the problem by the third quarter,   investors may get worried.A good problem to haveWhen it comes down to it, there are worse problems to have   than too many people wanting to order your product. Other   companies have experienced similar problems and managed to make   the most of them.For example,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) experienced a huge increase in the number of   businesses utilizing its Fulfilled by Amazon program in the   fourth quarter of 2015. That resulted in significant pressure on   operating margin expansion as Amazon's warehouses were filled to   the gills and fulfillment costs ballooned.Amazon prepared for a similar surge this year by asking   merchants to hold back inventory they didn't expect to sell until   the first quarter while continuing to build out its fulfillment   center network. The stock price and the company's margin growth   continued to improve throughout 2016.Indeed, the decline in Starbucks' stock price could present a   buying opportunity for investors who believe in management's   ability to solve problems like it's experiencing. They were all   keen to point out they've solved similar problems before, and   there's no reason to doubt they can solve another high-quality   problem yet again.Find out why Starbucksis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

3 Signs Netflix Inc.'s Best Days Are Ahead;2/6/2017;"Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) just closed the books on a record fiscal year that   added 19 million streaming members to its rolls. Yet with growth   slowing in its core U.S. market, and with no new geographies left   to conquer (except for China), some investors are concerned that   there's little room to add to its near 100 million subscribers --   and $61 billion market capitalization.Below, I'll highlight a few of the biggest factors that   suggest those worries are overblown.Pricing powerNetflix's fourth-quarter subscriber growth figuresblew away expectationsas 7 million people signed up for it service compared to the 5   million that CEO Reed Hastings and his team had forecast. That   outperformance allowed the company to post another year of   accelerating global gains: Net additions were 19 million in 2016,   up from 17.3 million in the prior year.makeArticleAd();Annual subscriber gains. Chart by author.The raw growth story would be impressive enough on its own,   but Netflix also demonstrated strong pricing power in this   report. A big chunk of the U.S. member base was pushed onto   higher-priced plans last quarter, which prompted users with a   good reason to cancel. Instead, not only did most members stick   around, but there's evidence that many customers who recently   bolted over the price increases decided to come back.In other words, TV fans are finding that Netflix's value   proposition is compelling, even at the higher pricing point that   has pushed average monthly spending up 15% and allowed   profitability to jump to almost 40% of sales in the core U.S.   market.International growthIn early 2016, the company sped up its global expansion plan   by simultaneously launching in nearly all the markets it wanted   to enter. There's nothing approaching that type of event in the   future, and so international subscriber growth is likely to trend   lower over the short term. Next quarter, for example, Netflix is   forecasting 3.7 million new users, compared to 4.5 million   additions in the prior-year period.Image source: Netflix.The global growth story stretches out far longer than just a   single year, though. Almost 20 quarters after launching in Latin   America, Netflix is finally getting up to speed in that market,   and there's every reason to expect a comparable learning curve in   other areas as it tweaks the service and builds brand   strength.The company sees a huge long-term opportunity in Japan, too,   but the biggest payoff there will come once the company is more   established and has compiled a deep enough portfolio of local   content. It won't be as dramatic asgoing live in 130 countries at once, but Netflix has a huge runway for international growth   ahead.Scale advantagesHastings and his team have been prioritizing subscriber growth   over earnings for the last several years. The thinking behind   that strategy was that Netflix first needed to establish global   scale to block out rivals. Only then would it use its dominant   position to extract meaningful profits for investors.We're finally entering the second part of that master plan --   and investors must be pleased. Netflix is finding that original   shows and movies travel well across borders, which is giving it a   key advantage in the bidding war for content against streaming   studios that have to piece together rights on a region-by-region   basis. The efficiencies are a key reason why it plans to scale   back on marketing spending while doubling operating profitability   this year.Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is no longer in that regional category, having   recently matched Netflix in global availability. But few other   streaming specialists can hope to even approach the$8 billion in spending($6 billion on content alone) that Netflix will shell out on its   service this year. And at some point, the online retailing titan   might even balk at the expense of keeping pace with the streaming   specialist.A full decade has passed since Netflix tiptoed into streaming   video in what Hastings predicted would be the company's second   act after dominating DVD rental. Yet its surging growth over the   last 12 months looks more like the beginning of that new chapter   than its conclusion.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Is 2017 the Year of the Retail Famine?;2/6/2017;"On today's episode of Shopping for Stocks, Editor Maddy Johnson takes on a huge problem facing the retail industry: big retail brands closing down stores.One of the biggest announcements came from department store bellwetherMacy'sM, who, after reporting a 2.1% drop in comparable sales for November and December and slashing its full-year profit forecast, is closing 63 stores this spring, eliminating 10,000 jobs in the process.Fellow department storeSearsSHLD, in addition to news that it would sell its iconic Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & DeckerSWK, announced it would close 109 Kmart stores and 41 of its namesake Sears outlets; the company did not say how many workers would be affected. Sears closed 78 stores last year, and over 200 in 2015.CVS HealthCVSrecently outlined its long-term growth strategy, which includes closing 70 stores in the next few months as well as a cost-cutting plan that would bring in $3 billion in savings from 2017 to 2021.Women's clothing retailerThe Limited, based in New Albany, Ohio, closed all of its brick-and-mortar stores this past weekend, but will continue to operate online only after January 8. The company operated about 250 mall-based stores in 2016, and the closings will affect roughly 4,000 jobs.Other mall retailers like Aeropostale, American Eagle OutfittersAEO, The Children's PlacePLCE, Chico'sCHS, Finish LineFINL, and Men's Wearhouse are all expected to close stores this year as well.

Charles Schwab To Cut Mutual Fund Expenses, Fuels Discount Brokerage Pricing War;2/6/2017;"Charles SchwabSCHWis slicing prices on their mutual fund expenses. Although great for persons who invest with them, stockholders are wary with the new move on speculation of reduced revenue. The company is trading down 1.34% to $39.62, intraday.On February 2nd, Charles Schwab announced they will be lowering expenses on their market-cap weighted index mutual funds. This is to equate them with their respective Schwab ETFs, which already offer some of the lowest expenses in the industry. Expenses will be as follows: 0.03% on Schwab S&P 500 Index FundSWPPX, 0.06% on Schwab Small-Cap Index FundSWSSX, and 0.04% on Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund.Additionally, the company is taking away investment minimums to be in these funds; a single share class will be utilized to make this move. Their top competitors such as Vanguard and Fidelity charge up to 4 times more in expenses and require a $5,000 minimum to invest in their funds.In addition to cutting expenses on mutual funds, trading commissions on stock and ETFs will also be reduced. Standard online stock and ETF trade commissions will drop by $2 to $6.95 per trade. This makes them lowest to their competitorsTD AmeritradeAMTDand E-TradeETFCwho charge $9.99.Along with the move, Charles Schwab is adopting a satisfaction guarantee policy. If a client is not satisfied with their services then the company will refund any transaction fees, advisory program fees, and commissions fees that were charged.The company announced that they estimate a loss of $15 million a month in revenue due to the new fee structure; less than 11% of their revenue comes from trading. It is important to note that Charles Schwab does not rely as heavily on trade commissions and expenses as its competitors.A Discount Brokerage Price WarCharles Schwab is shaking the discount brokerage industry by cutting their expenses. On the event of the news, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade took a hit of about 10%. Price cutting wars are nothing new in the discount brokerage industry. Brokerages for years now have been slashing prices in hopes of acquiring new investors.On the other hand, Kim Hillyer of TD Ameritrade seems to think that price points are not the only competitive advantage a brokerage can have. On event of Charles Schwab's news she wrote, ""…what you're seeing today is one company's interpretation of what 'value' looks like"". She went on to say TD Ameritrade's focus is on what their customers want which is, ""outstanding trading platforms, innovative tools, a broad product selection, education, 1:1 support and guidance, flexibility and choice at one simple, straightforward price point"".Charles Schwab is adapting a pricing model which parallels that of Amazon'sAMZNAmazon Prime.

Does Netflix Need Innovative Tools To Increase Viewership?;2/6/2017;"Netflix (NFLX) has had a spectacular Q4 2016 with its international subscriber base increasing rapidly and margins from this segment showing strong signs of improvement. In the domestic segment, despite competition from several existing and new players, Netflix was able to add 1.93 million members in Q4 2016, exceeding its forecast of 1.45 million. While this growth is likely to slow down in the future as the market matures, we expect Netflix to continue to add subscribers in the domestic market over our forecast period.Netflix's focus on original programming is likely to be the key driving factor for domestic subscriber retention and growth. Also contributing is its strong content library, which increases binge watching. The company is investing heavily in original programming  In fact, it has a $6 billion content budget for 2017, which makes it one of the biggest media spenders on content.  It is also looking at innovative ways to make binge watching easier. At one of its recent ""hack day"" events, Netflix engineers devised a way by which viewers can scroll and playvideos through a headband. Using a modified Muse device - a headband that is intended to help with meditation - users can nod to select shows or movies and think ""play"" in order to get the title to start. The device,called MindFlix, works by reading brain activity and using the readings to perform predetermined functions. While this device is not currently available for consumers and the company has not confirmed any launch date, it indicates that Netflix is looking at innovative tools which will make binge watching easier. Last year the company came up with innovative socks which switch off Netflix if the viewer falls asleep during a binge watching session.  While these tools can intrigue viewers, high quality original content will be the key for Netflix's subscriber growth. The company is investing in technology initiatives to identify areas which can make the customer experience better. Still, the two key areas of focus for Netflix should be content creation and the optimization of bandwidth usage. Conveniences such as scrolling and playing videos without using any device or auto switch off are not likely to drive significant subscriber growth.makeArticleAd();Netflix is investing heavily on original programming and this is showing results in terms of subscriber growth. While its international expansion continues at a rapid pace the company is likely to face challenges as it expands into various geographies, such as low internet speeds and consumers' preference for local content. In the U.S., as the threat of limiting data usage by broadband players looms, Netflix can be impacted if consumers need to pay more to view its content with better streaming quality. We believe innovation to provide high quality streaming at lower bandwidth consumption will be critical for Netflix's growth in the long term. While its ""hack days"" might come up with interesting innovative tools to promote binge watching, we believe focus on content and optimization of bandwidth usage are the two key areas for Netflix's long term growth.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"
Wal-Mart Tried to Take on Amazon Prime and Failed;2/6/2017;"Image source: Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) doesn't think it makes sense to charge its online   customers for two-day shipping anymore. The retailer is shutting   down its year-and-a-half old ShippingPass program, a $50-per-year   two-day shipping service similar toAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime. ""In today's world of e-commerce, two-day   free shipping is table stakes,"" Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart U.S.   e-commerce wrote in an announcement.makeArticleAd();Wal-Mart is trying to spin the move as a positive, but it's   simply masking the fact that it tried to take on Amazon Prime and   failed. Prime is one of the three pillars of Amazon, and its   membership drives astounding loyalty. Wal-Mart was looking for a   similar effect with ShippingPass. Instead, it's moving down   market, reducing the threshold for free shipping to $35 from $49,   and promising to get some 2 million items to customers in just a   couple days.Wal-Mart can't competeBoth Amazon and Wal-Mart boast huge marketplaces that bring   together thousands of merchants on their online platforms. But   where Wal-Mart falls short is that it's heavily reliant on its   third-party merchants to fulfill online orders themselves. In   fact, just 2 million items qualify for two-day shipping.By comparison, Amazon's marketplace has over 50 million   Prime-eligible items. That's thanks to its Fulfilled by Amazon   service where merchants send inventory to Amazon's warehouses,   and Amazon handles shipping individual items to customers.In other words, Wal-Mart's two-day shipping service was   half-baked compared to Amazon's. Customers who signed up for the   free trial were likely disappointed at the lack of product   selection, and didn't pay up for the service.Wal-Mart won't tear customers away from PrimeBy offering free two-day shipping to everyone, Wal-Mart isn't   trying to get Prime members to ditch Amazon (at least it   shouldn't be). Instead, its strategy seems to be to prevent   customers from ever signing up for it in the first place. Prime   members are extremely loyal and have an extremely lowchurn rate, so that's about the best Wal-Mart can hope for.It's a bit late to the game, however, considering Amazon has   already signed up around half of the households in the U.S. In   the last year alone, Amazon added ""tens of millions"" of new   members.If Wal-Mart stands any chance of competing with Amazon, it   needs toleverage its physical stores. That's exactly what its new shipping program does. Items   qualifying for two-day shipping are usually available in local   stores already, meaning Wal-Mart only needs to ship it the last   mile to a shoppers home.While free two-day shipping for everyone may win Wal-Mart a   few one-off purchases, it won't cut into the loyal and growing   Amazon Prime customer base. The best it can hope for is to   establish its online portals as top of mind for online shoppers.   That's one of the biggest hurdles for Wal-Mart or any online   retailer to overcome.Amazon currently dominates mindshare. Fifty-five percent of   online product searches start on its website, according to a   survey from BloomReach last Fall. If Wal-Mart's new shipping   policy can help it grab some of those product searches, it ought   to be considered a win even if its attempt to take on Amazon   Prime failed.10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) still appear undervalued despite the company already significantly outperforming the market. If you bought stock in Alibaba since the end of December, you're up almost 20%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, for reasons I will outline, Alibaba stock - thanks to emergence in the cloud and the momentum in its core e-commerce business - can still deliver 25% returns in the next 12 to 18 months.Assessing the Value in Alibaba StockAlibaba shares have risen some 15% year to date, compared with about 2% rise in theS&P 500 Index. Based on fiscal 2018 earnings estimates of $4.30 per share, Alibaba stock is currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 23, which is about in line with the average stock in the S&P 500.And here's the thing: Assuming the company does earn $4.30 per share, that would translate to year-over-year earnings growth of 23%. From my vantage point, Alibaba stock remains one of the better bargains on the market even with its recent rally.In other words, investors still have an opportunity to buy not only into a great growth story, but also diversify their investments by betting on the growth of China's middle class. But Alibaba is more than just a bet on China's recovering economy. The company, which saw a 54% jump inthird-quarter revenue, leading to an impressive 17-cent beat on the bottom line, crushed Wall Street's fiscal estimates on almost every metric.3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush InvestorsOften compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) because of their e-commerce similarities, Alibaba founder/executive chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang prove they can do what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has shown a knack for: Mash the profit-margin accelerator whenever he feels like it and when the market least expects it. And as with Amazon, Alibaba's cloud platform Alicloud (which posted a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue) has become a force.Not only is Alibaba enjoying an increase in the number of paying customers, the customers are also spending higher than usual. All told, the company's strong revenue growth, driven by its diversified technological and data strategy continues to pay off. And with the company boosting its 2017 fiscal year revenue growth guidance from 48% to 53%, Alibaba is showing no signs of slowing down.Bottom Line for Alibaba StockWith cloud revenues beginning to take a bigger portion of the business, combined with the strength in its core e-commerce operation, BABA has tons of room to run.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200As such, while I'm not willing to suggest BABA deserves the same respect as Amazon, which is priced at a forward P/E of 63, Alibaba should command a P/E of 30, which puts Alibaba stock at around $130, delivering almost 25% to 30% in the next year-and-a-half or so.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe postHere's How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%appeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile a whole lot of market headlines have been largely focused on trying to game the new mood in Washington, the real signal behind the noise has been coming from a lot closer to Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEarnings season is approaching a climax and so far a lot of trading lights are flashing green for the first time in years. With over 35% of theS&P 500companies already on the books showingaround 4.6% growthback on the table for the market as a whole, we know the broad strokes.This is great to see, especially when you consider where we were a year ago. And while I expect the rest of earnings season to be relatively calm, that doesn't mean there aren't new things the upcoming reports can tell us.In fact, three companies reporting earnings over the next few weeks should give us some good insight into economies and sectors that have struggled in the past. This is why I'm so excited for whatYum China Holdings Inc(NYSE:YUMC),Mylan N.V.(NASDAQ:MYL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) have to say about China, biotechs and the energy sector.Yum China (YUMC) EarningsYum China's results on Tuesday will shed light on what Beijing won't tell us and what the markets around the world need to know: the health of the mainland Chinese consumer, as measured by the most accurate indicator ever invented.Yum China runsmore than 7,300Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants in China - the top chains in the country - and if the number holds up sequentially, it's a pretty good sign that over 1.3 billion hungry people are still snacking as much as ever.3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush InvestorsI'm looking for $2 billion in sales and management's take on conditions on the ground. Unless you're really in the stock as anything other than a proxy on the Chinese consumer, that's the key number to watch.Mylan (MYL) EarningsMylan's earnings release on Feb. 15 is also more color than numbers. This particular company is at the center of controversy around drug pricing and healthcare regulation -remember the EpiPen?I'm looking for management to answer questions on the mood in Washington in terms of price controls and even repatriation of foreign profit. Of course if the business is booming, MYL itself could be a good buy here at barely eight times forward earnings and annualized growth north of 10%.Tesla (TSLA) EarningsTesla needs little introduction: you either love Elon Musk or you find it hard to justify paying mega-cap prices for a niche manufacturer.Nonetheless, on Feb. 22, I'm looking for hints on energy policy and uptake on the company's home solar systems. Are U.S. households still going green, or has this trend faded as conventional power sources remain cheap?And if progress toward the mass-market electric car hits any roadblocks, I expectNasdaqto feel the pain the following Thursday.Amazon.com, Inc.

Alibaba Group, Amazon, Raymond James, Sandvik AB and Stora Enso Oyi highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/6/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 06, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsAlibaba Group Holdings(NYSE:BABA-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day andAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onRaymond James(NYSE:RJF-Free Report),Sandvik AB(OTCMKTS:SDVKY-Free Report) andStora Enso Oyi(OTCMKTS:SEOAY-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Alibaba Group Holdings(NYSE:BABA-Free Report)reported strong December quarter numbers on January 24 with top and bottom line beats and a whopping 54% year-over-year growth in sales.Wall Street analysts liked that growth and the outlook going forward enough to raise estimates 23% for the current fiscal year (ending in March) from $2.15 to $2.65. And the next fiscal year also moves up 23% from $2.56 to $3.16.Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang highlighted ""We are driving the age of 'New Retail,' which leverages big data and innovation to provide a seamless online and offline experience for nearly half a billion mobile monthly active users. This retail transformation will make it even easier and more efficient for brands and retailers to engage with these consumers anywhere, anytime.""After the conference call, my colleague Ryan McQueeney explained ""Alibaba further detailed its 'New Retail' concept, saying that it will help the company tap into the entirety of China's $4.8 trillion retail sector by breaking down the distinction between online and offline commerce. To that end, Alibaba has started partnering with several different brick-and-mortar retailers.Bear of the Day:The good news in theAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report)quarterly report was a 10% earnings beat and year-over-year revenue growth that was still very enviable with +24% overall and +47% for AWS (Amazon Web Services).The bad news in the report was that even these terrific sales numbers were below Wall Street expectations.And the guidance for the current quarter doesn't get any more optimistic. That's why the stock was down 3.5% on Friday -- on more than 2.5X the normal volume -- and why it will probably trade under $800 as many analysts lower their earnings estimates and price targets.Zacks Rank Strikes AgainBut the stock was already in the cellar of the Zacks Rank going into the report because analysts were busy lowering estimates in the past few weeks.30 days ago, the full year EPS projection for 2017 was $9.19. By late last week, even before we heard from the company on February 2, that profit picture had dropped to $8.88.You can expect that consensus to drop further as all the estimates filter in this week to the Zacks Rank.And 2018 estimates had already taken a bigger hit in the last month prior to Thursday's report, dropping roughly a dollar from the $14.98 consensus a few weeks ago.Expect those projections to probably get reeled in a little further too.Additional content:Animal Spirits or… a Bubble?Note: This is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John   Blank's fullMarket Strategy report. To access the entire PDF,click here.IntroductionThe February version of Zacks market strategy outlines the following themes.What produces 2017 U.S. optimism?Trump unleashes animal spirits. Beneath that, stellar U.S. job gains and stronger wages build. High stock prices support consumer spending. Technicals are in momentum mode. Traders ignore worry, sharing Republican optimism. Demographics can build Health Care, but the ACA gets repealed. Does it get replaced, or not? House buying & construction get stronger still. For banks, a rise in rates is likely across 2017.What's alive for pessimists?Valuations. A 14-year high on the U.S. dollar hits harder. Recession worry centers on real estate. Rising rates may push down home and business construction demand. A bubble popping somewhere is possible.Zacks Sector/Industry/Company TelescopeIn February's sector/industry tables, the big upward move came from Industrials. Construction demand is clearly quite strong in this environment.There are a number of other strong niches. Financials lead in the rising rate environment called for in 2017. The Materials sector gets a bid from buying by Mainland China. Infrastructure for the One Belt-One Road project is showing up. Info Tech has a RED HOT spot in Semiconductors, once again.The losers are out-of-favor sectors -- Health Care and Consumer Staples. These 2 sectors cannot seem to shake off the pessimism. The shorts are all over Drug and Biotech stocks, still.(1) Financialsremained Very Attractive again. The Invest Banking & Brokering, Banks & Thrifts, Banks-Major, and Finance are the leaders.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY): Raymond James(NYSE:RJF-Free Report)Raymond James Financial Inc. is a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged principally in the securities brokerage business including the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities, and the sale of tax advantaged investments, mutual funds and other investment products and provides investment management services for retail and institutional clients.(2) Industrialshave risen to a Very Attractive sector. This is due to Construction-Building Services, Machinery-Electrical and Metal Fabricating. Railroads and Machinery are doing better, too.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY): Sandvik AB(OTCMKTS:SDVKY-Free Report)Sandvikis a high-tech engineering group with advanced products and a world-leading position within selected areas. Worldwide business activities are conducted through representation in 130 countries.(3) Materialsstay an Attractive Sector. The leaders are Paper, Steel and Metals-Non-Ferrous. China must be buying again.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY): Stora Enso Oyi(OTCMKTS:SEOAY-Free Report)Stora Ensois an integrated forest products company producing magazine papers, newsprint, fine papers and packaging boards, areas in which the Group is a global market leader. Stora Enso also conducts extensive sawmilling operations. To strengthen its market position and better serve customers in the United States, the company acquired the U.S.-based, Consolidated Papers, Inc. in 2000.(4) Info Techremains a Market Weight. But the Semis are RED HOT!(5) Consumer Discretionaryrises to a Market Weight. The Autos/Tires/Trucks is best, followed by Media, Home Furnishing-Appliances and Leisure Services.(6) Energyis a solid Market Weight. The Oil E&P, Oil & Gas Integrated, Oil & Gas Pipelines and Coal industries show the effects of positive Trump trade sentiment.(7) Utilitiesrose to a Market Weight. The Utilities-Water Supply group got a bid.(8) Telcosremain Unattractive. Defensives are not in favor.(9) Health Careremains Unattractive. This out-of-favor sector just can't get moving.(10) Consumer Staplesis Very Unattractive again. The sole bright spot is Agri-business.Note: This is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John   Blank's fullMarket Strategy report.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Charles Schwab, Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund, Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund and Schwab U.S. TIPS;2/6/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 06, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Charles Schwab(NYSE:SCHW-Free Report),Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund(MUTF:SWPPX-Free Report),Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund(MUTF:SWSSX-Free Report) andSchwab U.S. TIPS ETF(NYSEARCA:SCHP-Free Report).How Charles Schwab Is Becoming the Amazon of InvestingAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) has become a behemoth in the retail world.Sure, the company's most recent earnings report may have left a bit to be desired, but there is no denying how far Amazon has come in a few short years. The company easily dominates the consumer world, and it has left a variety of big-box retailers in its wake in the process.While we can point to a number of reasons for Amazon's ascent, a key to their rise is clearly Amazon Prime. This subscription service-which costs $99/year-gives users free two day shipping, video content, music, and a number of other features as well. The deal is so good that some estimateclose to half of the country's households have a Prime account, with plenty of new subscribers now being added in foreign nations too.What is the point of this? Well, Prime members (at least in the U.S.)spend roughly twice as muchas non-Prime users on Amazon, while the service has an insane renewal rate in the United States,over 90% accordingto the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, so people are clearly seeing the value.But with so many services and offerings in the Prime package, how does Amazon make any money? Well, the idea is clearly to suck people in to the Amazon ecosystem via Prime, and then keep them there for years. And with such a high renewal rate and spending that is double non-Prime users, it is clearly paying off. One only needs to look at the demise of other retailers in a number of areas to understand just how much Amazon is dominating the consumer world these days.So, the strategy is to give people an offer that is too good to refuse in order to get them in the door and looking at higher margin products later on. AsJeff Bezos said, Prime is 'such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member'.The Amazon of Investing?We can see how Amazon has changed the world of retail and the consumer market, but is anyone doing the same thing for investing?I'd argue that Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW-Free Report) is adopting this 'Amazon model' in the world of investing, and this is especially evident after their recent move.Their latest announcementbrought fees down to $6.95/trade from their previous spot at $8.95/trade, while Schwab also announced a fee cut on some of its broad market mutual funds, and that mutual fund costs would match their ETF counterparts too.The company will now charge 0.03% for its Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (MUTF:SWPPX-Free Report), while the Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund (MUTF:SWSSX-Free Report) will cost 0.06% per year. Additionally, the company also reduced fees for its Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund down to 0.04% (which comes out later in February) to become an ultra-cheap choice in that market too. They also discussed the idea of reducing fees for the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHP-Free Report) and their fundamental index ETFs, but those changes will take place on March first.These cuts put Schwab's fees down to levels below its major competitors, Fidelity, E*Trade andTD Ameritrade, and it sent shockwaves throughout the industry. Share prices of ETFC and AMTD were down nearly 10% immediately following the announcement, while SCHW took a hit as well.I understand why the group was hit in the markets following the press release, as it definitely kicks off worries over a price war. And as for Charles Schwab, charging such rock bottom levels all but guarantees that Charles Schwab will lose money on its fund business, and it will probably see less revenues from its commissions in the process too.So Why Is This Like Amazon?To me, this is very reminiscent of the Amazon Prime service. You give people a ton of low cost options that are bound to please a wide range of people. So, instead of two day shipping and free video content, if you are in the investing world, you offer up fees that are less than major peers and nearly-free ETFs and mutual funds.The move gets plenty of people in the door, and it keeps them inside the ecosystem. Once you switch to Schwab for the low fees and start putting money in their ETFs and mutual funds, it becomes difficult to justify switching back. This is exactly like how you get used to the two-day shipping, music, Pantry, and other features from Amazon, keeping you stuck in the system. Charles Schwab, much like Amazon, realizes that winning over new customers is a vital part of this business, and that providing them low cost products is essential to keeping customers happy and away from the competition over the long-term.And once you have enough customers that you sucked in through the low price options, you now have the ability to earn money off them in different ways. Amazon does this with a variety of their media products and retail options in general (such as Pantry), though there are obviously some key differences between the retail and investing worlds.Schwab can do something similar to Amazon's approach nonetheless though. Bring people in for low cost index products and cheap trades, and then make the real profits off high margin activities that Amazon can only dream of. These include, investment management, servicing fees, and most importantly, investing the float.This last item will prove to be key for Schwab and other brokers, and especially if rates rise as most are expecting. For 2016, interest income accounted for roughly 44% of Schwab's net revenues, and that was in a year with mostly low-rates. Considering that trading revenue makes up about 11% of the total revenue (looking at 2016), and it is pretty reasonable to think that Schwab will be alright in the long term with a modest fee cut.I think that Schwab sees the same thing with the writing on the wall for a low rate environment. They are willing to sacrifice a bit in trading revenue now in order to get new users on the platform and get access to their potential asset base and the investable float that comes along with it. And if rates rise as most are expecting, this could prove to pay off, and especially considering that interest makes up a plurality of revenue already, and that is with rates at ultra-low levels.So, while Schwab might be down on this news now, it is a brilliant strategy in order to get more clients and capital in the door over the long haul. It is this type of forward thinking that has propelled Amazon to greatness in the consumer market, and it is about time someone tried this in the investing world as well.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>FollowBrian Bolanon Twitter@BBolan1Want more articles from this author?

Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Visa Inc (V);2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as last week's earnings and jobs euphoria has failed to carry over into premarket action this morning. Furthermore, Wall Street is wary ahead of key economic data from the White House, as President Trump is s required to submit a preliminary budget proposal to Congress on the first Monday of February. Investors are waiting to see just how Trump's campaign promises for massive infrastructure spending and tax cuts will take shape.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.21%, whileS&P 500futures are off 0.23% and theNasdaq-100futures are down 0.22%.On the options front, 3 Feb. options expiration drove heavy volume on Friday, as a wealth of earnings speculation finally came to a head. On the day, some 18.6 million calls and 14.7 million puts changed hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.68 while the 10-day moving average held at a three-month high of 0.69.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) attracted a surge in call activity ahead of President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at rolling back financial regulations - setting the stage for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act. Elsewhere,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) calls were also wildly popular after new broke that the company would begin assembling iPhones in India by the end of April. Finally,Visa Inc(NYSE:V) jumped more than 4.5% after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Bank of America Corp (BAC)Months of speculation came to an end on Friday, whenPresident Trump took steps to roll back regulationson the financial industry - setting the stage for banks like Bank of America to begin unrestricted share buybacks and dividend increases. What's more, financial industry analysts believe that if regulation rollbacks are on the table for banks, then corporate tax cuts can't be far behind, as they were also among Trump's campaign promises.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99BAC stock has been itching for such news for weeks now, with investors banking on deregulation and the possibility of increased dividends given BofA's strong performance in 2016. As a result, BAC options traders flooded the stock with calls on Friday, with these typically bullish bets making up 77% of the 1.3 million contracts traded.Taking a broader look at short-term BAC speculation, the February/March put/call open interest ratio has plunged in recent weeks to a perch at 0.50, with calls doubling puts among contracts set to expire within the next two months. Currently, the most popular strike is the March $25 call, where more than 174,000 contracts reside. This strike rests about 7.3% out of the money and last traded at an ask price of 20 cents, or $20 per contract.Apple Inc. (AAPL)According to news on Friday, Apple has finally broken through into India's massive mobile market. Apple will startmaking iPhones in India by the end of April, with Taiwan'sWistron Corp.assembling the phones in Bangalore, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Apple had requested a contentious 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment, but ministry officials refused to comment on any incentives in the deal.Call option volume on AAPL stock surged to well above normal levels following the news. Overall, some 1.03 million contracts traded on Apple, with calls gobbling up 71% of the day's take.That said, there is still plenty of room for additional call activity on AAPL, with the stock's February/March put/call OI ratio arriving at 0.85, with the March $125 arriving as the most popular calls strike with more than 81,000 calls in residence. This reading has begun to drift lower during the past week, and Friday's India news should help spur additional call activity this week.Visa Inc (V)Visa is ""everywhere investors should want to be,""Cowen and Company told investorsafter the former's strong quarterly earnings report. After the close on Thursday, Visa posted first-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $4.5 billion, easily topping estimates for 78 cents per share on sales of $4.3 billion. Visa also lifted its 2017 earnings outlook.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Will Test Your PatienceFollowing the report, V stock jumped roughly 4.6% to trade at a fresh all-time high just shy of $86 per share. Options traders signaled they expected additional gains from V stock, as volume rose to 223,000 contracts with calls snapping up 77% of the day's take. Calls have begun to add up for V stock, with the February/March put/call OI ratio falling to a reading of 0.66 on Friday.That said, there is some trepidation in the March series, where peak call OI of 13,000 contracts rests at the in-the-money $80 strike. Look for V options traders to roll these calls higher if the stock can maintain Friday's momentum.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth Potential5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe postMonday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Prime Air Drones Surprise in Super Bowl Ad;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you were one of the estimated 100 million+ viewers of Super Bowl 51, you saw some drones. There were the 200 quadcopters fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) that were part of Lady Gaga's halftime show. Those we were expecting, but another drone that showed up was a surprise.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) chose the Super Bowl to tease Amazon Prime Air - packages delivered to your home by AMZN drones.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA big part of the Super Bowl experience is the advertising. This is the one time of year when viewers actuallywantto see commercials. And with those viewersestimated at over 100 million, companies that forked out over $5 million for a 30-second spot make a big splash.Heck, even in Canada, the networks wereforced to run American adsinstead of substituting local commercials.And those 100 million-plus viewers saw a very short teaser commercial with anAmazon drone hoveringoutside the window of a woman who had just ordered some snacks: Amazon Prime Air.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAccording to the voice of Alexa, AMZN's personal digital assistant, we can ""Look for delivery soon.""History of Amazon Prime AirHow can you talk about the history of a service that doesn't yet exist? In the case of Amazon Prime Air and its use of Amazon drones, there's already a big backstory to talk about. AMZNhas a websitewhere it describes the services, shows off a number of Amazon drone videos and even has an FAQ section that spikes out many of the details about Amazon Prime Air.""We're excited about Prime Air - a delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.""The Amazon Prime Air storykicked off in 2013, when AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos took the wraps off a top secret project with Amazon drones on60 Minutes. Delivery of items under five pounds that would fit in the quadcopter's bucket would take place in under 30 minutes. At the time, Bezos told viewers to expect Amazon Prime Air within four to five years.Last December, a milestone was reached when AMZN claimedthe first Amazon drone delivery- an Amazon Fire TV and a bag of popcorn. As part of an Amazon Prime Air trial in the U.K., the company's drones had begun autonomously delivering packages to a very small group of consumers.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!At the end of the year, the company hit the news again when it was discovered it hadfiled a patent for a flying warehousethat would serve as an airborne base for Amazon drone deliveries.When Can You Expect an Amazon Drone atYourWindow?Despite the Super Bowl ad and Alexa's promise that Amazon Prime Air is coming soon, it's a little early to get excited yet. In particular, there are regulatory hurdles to overcome. FAA restrictions on drones that aren't flying in line-of-site operation were the primary reason why the Amazon drone trial is taking place in the U.K. instead of here. AMZN even put up a small disclaimer on its ad:""Prime Air is not available in some states (or any really). Yet.""But the fact that it spent the big Super Bowl ad bucks and showed off that Amazon drone to millions of viewers shows AMZN is serious about this. Amazon Prime Air may not be launching tomorrow, but the company is determined to get people excited about drone delivery. The campaign to turn Amazon drone delivery into the next big thing has officially begun.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Still Relies on Office and Windows;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is a newfound sense of optimism towardMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), and MSFT stock. Microsoft stock touched an all-time high over $65 last week after the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Yet, earnings haven't really budged the last five years, as lower PC sales have pressured Microsoft revenue from its legacy Windows and Office products.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrOf late, however, Microsoft has shown growth in newer products. The Surface product line and cloud computing, led by the Azure platform, are posting impressive growth rates. And, Surface and Azure are driving much of the optimism that has led MSFT stock to increase nearly 150% in a little over four years.But, lost in that optimism toward MSFT seems to be the fact that most of Microsoft's business is relatively unchanged from what it was three to four years ago - if not worse. Windows is a declining platform. There are multiple competitors trying to take down Office, and the cloud shift is cannibalizing some of Microsoft's SQL Server business.So, while there's a reason to see growth coming from Microsoft's new opportunities, investors in Microsoft stock need to remember that most of the business isn't nearly as attractive.Azure and Surface Are Driving Microsoft Stock HigherThere is reason for optimism toward Azure and Surface. The Surface line garners rave reviews, and sales have been strong. Microsoft has an impressive opportunity to drive commercial sales, with the company calling out a major contract with the U.K. Customs Service on its Q2 conference call.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryGrowth in Azure has been even more impressive. Revenue increased 93% in the second quarter and 104% in the first half of FY17. Microsoft remains well behindAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Amazon Web Services business. But, it has a clear opportunity to get to at least second place in what should be a large, fast-growing end market. That portends years of growth in Azure, a potential driver for MSFT stock.At the same time, however, Microsoft is a huge company, with trailing twelve-month revenue over $85 billion. And, neither Azure nor Surface represents a significant portion of those overall sales. Microsoft still doesn't break out Azure sales, but estimates suggest roughly $3 billion in fiscal 2017 - less than 4% of overall revenue.Per the MSFT 10-K, Surface sales were about $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and those sales actually declined 2% year over year in the second quarter. Some of that weakness came from the company's phasing out of Surface 3, and gross margins have improved. But, Azure and Surface combined are still less than 10% of total revenue. Even adding cloud computing as a whole, the figure barely gets to one-quarter next year, as MSFT is targeting a $20 billion run rate for commercial cloud.Simple math shows that it's tough for Microsoft to grow as a whole if only a small portion of revenue is driving that growth. Indeed, that's been the case this year. Overall revenue grew just 1.2% in the second quarter, and 0.8% for the first half. Excluding phone sales - where Microsoft has all but has exited the business - top-line growth was still under 5% in Q2 and Q1.Yet MSFT stock now is priced as a growth stock. That might be aggressive.MSFT Earnings Still Rely on Office and WindowsThe problem for MSFT stock is that so much of Microsoft's business still comes from its better-known products. The More Personal Computing segment generated nearly 50% of first half sales. That includes Windows revenue - which was almost 20% of FY16 sales - along with Xbox, Search, and devices (including Surface).Surface aside, that's not a particularly attractive group. Windows revenue seems likely to decline over the long term and has declined in each of the last two fiscal years. Bing has performed well of late, but in part because Microsoft has spent up to attract traffic. The Productivity and Business Processes segment is almost one-third of sales. Prior to Microsoft's acquisition ofLinkedIn Corp, it consisted primarily of Office and Dynamics, MSFT's CRM solution.First-half growth has been impressive, growing about 7%, excluding the contribution from LinkedIn. But, that comes after revenue in the segment declined between FY14 and FY16. While Office 365 sales growth looks solid, much of that growth is simply coming from a shift to ""on-premise"" Office licenses.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockThere are two concerns about the long-term growth prospects of Microsoft stock. The first is that some of the recent headline growth in categories such as cloud and office is simply coming from existing products. Some Azure sales are coming from customers switching away from Microsoft SQL Server. Office 365 sales aren't going to new customers who didn't have word processing software; rather, most subscribers are former users of disk-based Office products.A Trade War With China Puts These Stocks at RiskThe second concern is that so much of the business is stagnant (though bulls might say ""stable"" instead). That makes overall growth tough: if 20% of the business grows 20%, and the rest is flat or declining, overall growth rates stay in the 4% range.With MSFT stock steadily appreciated due almost solely to multiple appreciation, rather than earnings growth, investors are clearly expecting sales to pick up. But, it's important to remember that Azure and Surface won't be able to drive that acceleration on their own.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the Market5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Still Relies on Office and Windowsappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Bull of the Day: Alibaba Group (BABA);2/6/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA)reported strong December quarter numbers on January 24 with top and bottom line beats and a whopping 54% year-over-year growth in sales.Wall Street analysts liked that growth and the outlook going forward enough to raise estimates 23% for the current fiscal year (ending in March) from $2.15 to $2.65. And the next fiscal year also moves up 23% from $2.56 to $3.16.Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang highlighted ""We are driving the age of 'New Retail,' which leverages big data and innovation to provide a seamless online and offline experience for nearly half a billion mobile monthly active users. This retail transformation will make it even easier and more efficient for brands and retailers to engage with these consumers anywhere, anytime.""After the conference call, my colleague Ryan McQueeney explained ""Alibaba further detailed its 'New Retail' concept, saying that it will help the company tap into the entirety of China's $4.8 trillion retail sector by breaking down the distinction between online and offline commerce. To that end, Alibaba has started partnering with several different brick-and-mortar retailers.Wall Street Goes Gaga Over BABAFor this Bull of the Day, I thought it would be interesting to also hear from the analysts whose upward revisions to growth estimates have once again made the stock a Zacks #1 Rank. Here are 5 viewpoints on the Amazon (AMZN) of China...RBC Capital maintained their Outperform rating on Alibaba and kept their price target of $120 citing strong China retail sales growth and the new Cloud Computing division reaching a $1 billion revenue run rate.Goldman Sachs analyst Piyush Mubayi raised their FY17-FY19 revenue estimates by 3-4% on better growth outlook for China online advertising and International retail, and raised EPS estimates by 5-7% due to higher operating leverage. The firm reiterated their Conviction List-Buy rating on the stock and moved their price target from $128 to $135.Deutsche Bank raised its price target from $140 to $148 noting that the company attributed strong results to solid consumer usage, merchant spend, and impressive user growth, with mobile MAU (monthly active users) reaching 493 million, representing 25% growth. Here were some other important comments from their report...""Online marketing services again expanded robustly, by 47%, mainly driven by paid click growth. Commission revenue reaccelerated to 32% yoy, reflecting Tmall GMV growth recovery. Core e-commerce margin saw continued expansion to 64%, despite investment in globalization, FMCG & rural Taobao.""The company lifted FY17 full year guide from 48% to 53%. The new guide should be easy to achieve given BABA's strong momentum. Alibaba's ""New Retail"" strategy meanwhile seeks to integrate more offline retailers (e.g. Intime) with integrated inventory, membership and services to serve both users and merchants more efficiently. Monetization should thus increase long term.""Morgan Stanley raised its price target on BABA shares from $130 to $140 and maintained their Overweight rating.Analyst Grace Chen noted ""Alibaba raised F17 sales guidance from 48% YoY growth to 53% YoY after the stronger than expected F3Q17 results. It is transforming from an eCommerce to a marketing platform, which enables it to capture more merchant spending, expanding from distribution to marketing services. For F18, the company will focus on globalization, rural China, and cloud/big data to propelgrowth.""SunTrust analysts discussed 3 key points in their review of the quarter: 1) Core and organic revenue growth accelerated driven by engagement (clicks). FY revenue guidance increased to 53% YoY growth vs. 48% prior. 2) Core EBITA profitability of 64% was inline/better while investments in Lazada, Tmall Supermarket, and ""New Retail"" continue; and 3) Outlook for improved Cloud and Digital profitability remains positive for FY'18.The firm reiterated their Buy rating based on strong core growth and profitability, prudent growth investments, and the portfolio of assets. Their $125 2017 price target implies a sub-25X multiple for calendar year 2018 EPS.Disclosure: I own BABA shares for theZacks TAZR Traderservice.Now see our best long-term tradesAs a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

Will Facebook Challenge Netflix and Amazon Via Set Top Boxes?;2/5/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly developing a dedicated video app for   set top boxes to  expand its social networking ecosystem   into living rooms, according to theWall Street Journal. The app will be different from its existing app for set top   boxes, which is basically just a widescreen version of its mobile   app.Image source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Instead, the new app will mainly deliver videos from Facebook,   potentially turning it into a streaming rival toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . This supports previous reports that Facebook was   looking to license original content, and suggests that its users   could deliver live broadcasts to TVs via Facebook Live.Will this move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube already too far ahead in   the video streaming wars?Understanding Facebook's video effortsYouTube is the biggest video streaming site in the world, but   Facebook's video ecosystem has been growing quickly. Last   January, Facebook revealed that  its users watched 100   million hours of videos per day. At the time,Business Insiderestimated that YouTube users were watching about 650 million   hours of video every day.During last quarter's conference call, Facebook CEO  Mark   Zuckerberg called video ""a megatrend on the same order as   mobile"", and highlighted the ways that video ecosystem was   expanding. It recently added a new tab in the Facebook app for   top videos and recommendations in the U.S., tested a version of   Live 360 videos for slower connections, and added live face masks   and camera effects. It also plans to invest more in original   video content to ""seed that ecosystem"" throughout 2017.Facebook's interest in videos makes sense, since video ads   cost much more than traditional display ads. As Facebook's active   user growth slows down, video ads can bolster its top line by   milking more ad revenue from existing users. Since nearly 94% of   Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users already access the    site from mobile devices, it also needs to look toward   other platforms -- like set top boxes -- to continue growing its   ad ecosystem.Carving out a niche between Netflix and AmazonAt first glance, it seems like Facebook could collide with   Netflix and Amazon's streaming video ecosystems. But Facebook   doesn't plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on big   budget shows likeHouse of CardsandMan in the High Castle.Instead, Zuckerberg plans to focus on ""shorter-form content to   start,"" noting that the videos will generally be split into   content people produce socially for friends, promotional content   from businesses and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financed   ""premium"" content to differentiate it from other platforms. CFO   David Wehner was vague about what that premium content would   actually be, merely stating that the company was ""looking at a   wide range of content"" and ""working toward a revenue share model   with creators.""Those statements indicate that Facebook wants to carve out a   niche on set top boxes, instead of trading costly blows with   Netflix and Amazon. Since Facebook's video platform is all about   delivering ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't   be competing for Netflix or Amazon's subscription-based   revenues.Is Facebook actually making a play for smart     homes?Facebook's new set top box app could also help it gain a   foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon has already established   a major presence in homes with its Kindle tablets, Fire TV set   top boxes, and Echo speakers. Google is trying to catch up with   Home, andAppletethers devices to its HomeKit platform for iOS.Facebook doesn't have an official horse in that race yet, but   Zuckerberg recently showcased Jarvis, a smart  home AI   platform he developed for his own home. The platform, which uses   voice commands to control devices, is controlled via a Messenger   bot.Image source: Facebook.By expanding Facebook's ecosystem to set top boxes like Apple   TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network couldpotentiallypiggyback off that hardware to sync with smart home devices. If   Facebook links Messenger to those ""hubs"", it could take control   of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and   widen its moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other   challengers.The key takeawayFacebook's plans to expand its video ecosystem aren't   surprising, and a dedicated video app for set top boxes would be   the logical next step. It won't challenge heavyweights like   Netflix and Amazon, but it could capture a niche market of users   who want to view Facebook video content on a streaming platform   optimized for TVs. If the effort is successful, it could make its   video ads more valuable and give it a firm foundation for   eventually challenging other smart home players.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

What Investors Missed in the Market Last Week;2/5/2017;"The U.S. economy was trying to cooperate and end the week on a   high note after the Labor Department announced that the U.S.   added 227,000 new jobs in January. That was the largest gain in   four months and was considerably higher than the expected 197,000   new jobs. While that was a bright spot, hourly wages rose a   less than impressive 0.1% to $26 an hour -- but the past 12   months have still seen wages rising faster than since the   recovery from the recession.In other news, here are a handful of companies that made big   headlines or big moves last week in the markets.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();No more dramaThe headlines in regard toAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) fourth quarter were, in my opinion, a complete   eye-roller. Amazon's revenue during the fourth quarter increased   a hefty 22% to $43.7 billion, compared with last year's $35.7   billion. But neither the headlines nor the market paid any   attention to the strong 22% gain, focusing instead on the fact   that Amazon missed consensus analysts' estimates of $44.7   billion.The market also shrugged off the fact that Amazon's operating   income jumped 13% to $1.3 billion and that its net income soared   55% up to $749 million. Moreover, earnings per share checked in   with a 54% jump from the prior year's fourth quarter up to $1.54   per share.It's easy to imagine the frustration from long-term investors   who watched the market send Amazon shares lower simply because   the company didn't meet the expectations of analysts who don't   run the business. But this is the world we live in, and the   markets we trade in.At least one analyst had a positive outlook. Robert Drbul of   Guggenheim put a price target of $950 on Amazon and had this to   say on CNBC'sSquawk Box: ""We think from the forecast and the future, we still have   20-plus-percent growth in '17 and '18 and even higher growth in   the AWS piece of it,"" referring to Amazon Web Services.Just about any company in the market would love the have the   ""problems"" Amazon is having at this point, because growing   revenue 22% from a base of $35.7 billion is staggering. Despite   the ""miss,"" and a slightly lower share price, Amazon is not a   company to bet against.It's a pet's world; we're just living in itShares ofIDEXX Laboratories(NASDAQ: IDXX) , a company that primarily develops, manufactures,   and distributes diagnostic products and equipment for pets and   livestock, had a great week, with shares soaring roughly 16%. The   driving forces behind the surge were stronger-than-anticipated   fourth-quarter earnings and 2017 earnings guidance that increased   by eight pennies, to between $2.85 and $3.01 per share.Starting from the top, revenue during the quarter moved 11%   higher to $443 million, compared with the prior year, thanks to   the company's tests for companion animals, which increased 13%.   That showing topped consensus estimates of $435 million.   Management also posted 3,167 premium instrument placements, good   for 15% growth year over year.On the bottom line, IDEXX's earnings per share checked in at   $0.58 during the fourth quarter, a 21% gain over the prior year   and a 33% increase on a constant currency basis. That was also a   significant beat, as analysts were expecting earnings per share   of only $0.51 during the fourth quarter. Full-year EPS came in at   $2.44, a 19% jump over the prior year, and a 25% jump on a   constant currency basis.It was a strong fourth quarter that put the finishing touches   on an excellent year, and one look at this next graph should   excite investors -- because such a lead in R&D suggests that   more strong quarters and top-of-the-line products are on the   way.Image source: IDEXX Laboratories' Raymond James     presentation.Another one bites the dustIt's no secret that a majority of clothing retailers have   really struggled in recent months and years. Some have had a hard   time adapting to changing consumer preferences, while others have   been crushed by their inability to compete online.Ralph Lauren Corp.(NYSE: RL) could be the next victim, as shares fell 13% last week   and have shed half their value over the past three years.The surprise last week stunned analysts: Less than two years   after taking the reins at Ralph Lauren, CEO Stefan Larsson   announced that he will depart. The unexpected move is reportedly   the result of a rift between Larsson and the company's founder,   who didn't agree on business strategy going forward.Wells Fargoanalyst Ike Boruchow had this to say, according toBarron's: ""While RL certainly isn't a 'one man show,' we expect investors   likely have questions around the reality of the turnaround   without the leader who developed it. This is especially true   considering Larsson was perceived to be one of the top retail   leaders in the industry and a key confidence builder for   investors given the difficult turnaround RL has ahead of   them.""All of that drama aside, Ralph Lauren reported that sales were   down 12% during its fiscal third quarter, compared with the prior   year. Earnings fell a staggering 37% on a reported basis, though   that figure came down to 18% when adjusting for restructuring and   other costs.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

These 2 Tech Companies Have Made the Most AI Acquisitions;2/4/2017;"Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled alistof the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI)   companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known   tech giants making large investments to increase their   capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution   of the technology, and its direct uses.Google and Intel are in the race for artificial     intelligence. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Google's been on a buying spreeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is well known for itsaspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these   companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent   improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch   of Google Home and its plans to take onAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN)Alexa virtual assistantand the Echo smart-speaker home system.The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice   commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make   reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational   bots, while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language   improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations:   Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and   bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve   recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a   calendar using smart scheduling.Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch   focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks   technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision   Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object   recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to   improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and   specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the   virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's   Alexa.London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions,   with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already   boasted a significant investment in the area with its development   of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains   in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its   current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general   AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said,   Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to   business uses.Is Intel's acquisition of Nervana a threat to NVIDIA? Image     source: Intel.Intel will take the fight to NVIDIAIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron   specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with   deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the   same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture   recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created   user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software   for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous   driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and   cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for   accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning   capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's   RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its   IoT business.The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be   that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported   price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce   machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its   graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for   companiestraining AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level   that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant   boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for   NVIDIA.As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see   more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an   edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely   depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into   existing business lines.

Will 2017 Be American Outdoor Brand Corp's Best Year Yet?;2/4/2017;"The past year was anawesome oneforAmerican Outdoor Brands(NASDAQ: AOBC) . Handgun sales jumped 40%, rifle sales were up   70%, and its new outdoors market increased 50%, albeit from a   bunch of acquisitions. Yet when you look at its stock, investors   found it lacking, remaining largely unchanged from where it   started.AOBCdata byYChartsmakeArticleAd();That's because after the election of Donald Trump as   president, the urgency to buy a gun before new, stricter laws   were enacted evaporated. At the recent industry SHOT Show trade   show, American Outdoor Brands said that adjusted firearms data in   December tumbled more than 17% from the year-ago period, with   handguns plunging 30%. Considering that firearms account for 88%   of its revenues, can 2017 really be American Outdoor Brands best   year ever?You betcha!Guns aren't going awayAlthough it's true that gun sales were lower in December than   they had been the previous year, breaking a19-month streakof ever higher monthly numbers, sales were still higher than any   other December without an incident of domestic terrorism. The   month was only bested by December 2012 and December 2015, months   notable for the tragic shootings in Sandy Hook and San   Bernardino, California, respectively. It indicates there's still   plenty of latent demand for firearms, and the likely reason is   that personal safety has become a paramount issue for gun   buyers.Image source: Getty Images.The most popular guns being bought today are thosedesigned for concealed carry, small, lightweight weapons that still pack a wallop in   firepower. And if the continuing series of protests and unrest   are any indication, concerns for defense of self, family, and   property will remain uppermost on people's minds. Gun sales may   not run at the blistering pace they've been at, but it's likely   they'll stay at elevated levels.The great outdoorsBeyond just guns, though, American Outdoor Brands is   transforming itself into a broader, more diversified manufacturer   of products for the outdoor recreational industry. With a much   larger target market -- some $30 billion to $35 billion,   according to AOB's management, compared to $14 billion for   firearms -- there's much more opportunity for growth.While there are a few, big-name retailers focused on servicing   the market, including Bass Pro Shops,Cabela's, andDick's Sporting Goods, not to mention mass merchandisers likeWal-Martor online retailers such asAmazon.com, it remains a very fragmented industry with some 12,000   independent retailers. Yet it's also an industry that is very   complementary to its existing customer base and the new   opportunities should give American Outdoor Brands a chance to   cross-sell to them.Sights set on the futureVery much in the same vein, and underscoring exactly what it's   trying to achieve, acquisitions like its purchase of Crimson   Trace create completely new lines of business, yet ones that   don't diverge too far from the path it was originally on.Image source: Crimson Trace.With its buyout of the laser sight manufacturer, AOB created a   new business segment: electro-optics. Crimson Trace has a   decade-long record of growing revenues at a compounded rate of   more than 10% annually, a key reason why it was purchased, but   it's a natural extension of its firearms business. Laser sighting   and tactical lighting are already items gun buyers are looking   for (and Crimson Trace was already a long-term supplier of laser   sighting systems for Smith & Wesson), but it also opens up   new products for it such as various sights, aiming and ranging   devices, magnifiers, and scopes for a variety of   applications.A bright futureA lot of these potential growth markets are long term in   nature, and American Outdoor Brands admits as much. Yet they   indicate a greater diversity of revenue streams, much less stock   volatility, and a chance to move away from being just about   guns.In a year that's supposedly going to see fewer gun purchases,   a business model that de-emphasizes that segment of its   operations while channeling more energy into a niche that is   larger and still growing in popularity suggests 2017 will be   American Outdoor Brands' best year yet.10 stocks we like better than American Outdoor Brands   CorporationWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Advance Auto Parts to announce earnings;2/4/2017;"What's HappeningAuto-parts retailer Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is expected to post its quarterly resultsafter the market closeson February 9. Analysts forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.09 per share, down from $1.32 during the same period last year. The stock has been trending lower over the last two months, and shares are currently down 4.4% on the year.Technical AnalysisAAP was recently trading at $163.09, down $14.74 from its 12-month high and $31.50 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for AAP are bearish and the stock is a weak downward trend. The stock has recent support above $159.70, and has resistance below $168.50. Of the 18 analysts who cover the stock, six rate it a ""strong buy"", two rate it a ""buy"", eight rate it a ""hold"", and two rate it a ""strong sell"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 2 STARS ""Sell"" ranking.Analyst's ThoughtsAAP has been trending lower over the last month, and the stock could use a solid earnings report to bring back investor enthusiasm. The company's third-quarter report was solid, with results topping estimates on both the top and bottom lines, but the stock rose too sharply on the news, and has recently been giving back some of those gains. If AAP is able to follow up last quarter's report with another solid set of numbers, I would expect to see the stock quickly erase a large portion of its recent losses. Analysts remain upbeat, setting a price target of $177.69 on the stock, which is 8.9% above its current trading price. Despite the bullish price target, the stock's recent weakness suggests that Wall Street will drive the stock even lower if the company's quarterly numbers disappoint.The biggest concern right now for both Advance Auto and its biggest competitor AutoZone (AZO) is that Amazon (AMZN) is trying to aggressively move into the market. Amazon has recently made deals with some of the largest auto parts makers, and the news of these contracts hurt shares of all the major auto parts retailers. The good news for the sector is that a lot of parts are purchased in stores only after some assistance has been made by a sales rep, and a lot of the parts are very time sensitive and needed to keep cars on the road. Amazon is a concern, but it is not an immediate threat, and investors will come back into AAP as long as the quarterly numbers are not weaker than expected.Stock Only TradeIf you're looking to establish a long stock position in AAP, consider buying the stock under $163.00. Sell if it falls below $146.50 or take profits if it gets to $187.50.Bullish TradeIf you want a bullish hedged trade on the stock, consider a March 140/145 bull-put credit spread for a 60-cent credit. That's a potential 13.6% return (118.5% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 10.7% to cause a problem.Bearish TradeIf you want to take a bearish stance on the stock at this time, consider a March 175/180 bear-call credit spread for a $0.35 credit. That's a potential 7.5% return (65.4% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 7.5% to cause a problem.Covered Call TradeIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basis on a new position, you may want to consider a March $160.00 covered call. Buy AAP shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the March $160.00 call for a debit of $154.80 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 3.4%, and a target annualized return of 30.0% (for comparison purposes only)."
Stocks Surge as Trump Rolls Back Dodd-Frank;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities surged on Friday back to all-time highs, enjoying the best one-day gain of the year so far. The catalyst was executive action by President Trump to roll back some of the new Wall Street regulations put in place following the financial crisis, including the ""fiduciary"" rule that would've increased the compliance risk for financial advisors.makeArticleAd();Investors were also encouraged by a ""Goldilocks"" jobs report that featured better-than-expected payroll gains along with a slight increase in the unemployment rate and weaker wage gains - a perfect combination of strong job growth along with a diminished inflation that likely removes the threat of a March rate hike from the Federal Reserve.In the end, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained 0.9%, theS&P 500added 0.7%, theNasdaq Compositewafted up 0.5% and theRussell 2000gained 1.5%. Treasury bonds gave up early strength to finish little changed, the dollar weakened, gold lost 0.1% and oil gained 0.4%.Financial stocks - no surprise - led the way with a 2% gain followed by energy, up 0.9%.

A big revenue miss fromGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) on a 12% decline in shipments - hurt by the Karma drone recall and a lack of marketing support - hammered shares for a 12.7% loss.Overall, the fourth-quarter earnings season is now a little more than half over: With 55% of S&P 500 companies reporting results, earnings growth is set to rise 4.6% from last year. That will mark the first back-to-back quarter of earnings growth since the beginning of 2015.For now, the drop in rate hikes and the shift in the Trump narrative back to pro-business - after a recent diversion into possible negatives like an immigration clampdown and possible trade war - sets the stage for a resumption of the post-election uptrend. The nearest potential headwind is Fed Board Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress later this month.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialFor now, the ""Trump-flation"" trade is back on with financial stocks ready to retake the lead.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdgeandEdge Proinvestment advisory newsletters.

Should You Buy Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) used to be the unparalleled natural foods leader. It used to be the only real option, in much of America anyway, to find natural, organic and healthier foods. The company rode its first-mover position to dominance and WFM stock soared.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)But as so often happens in capitalist economies, the competition arrived soon after.Earlier this decade, WFM stock seemed unstoppable. Now shares of the organic grocer have fallen by half from their prior peak, as investors fret over Whole Foods' slowing growth rate and mounting competitive problems.A downturn in food prices hasn't helped either. Are the 365 stores and WFM stock's dividend enough to support the share price here, or will it continue to fall?WFM Stock ConsGrocery Deflation Cycle:There has been a big problem for grocery stores as a sector: deflation in food prices. Many common staples have dropped and then dropped some more in price. Eggs, various meats, cereals and even produce have been under heavy pressure. In theory, you'd think this would cause higher margins for grocery stores. Generally cheaper input prices are good for business. However, it hasn't worked that way for grocery stores.This is because grocery stores are profoundly competitive. There's very little moat around them - most stores compete tooth and nail against various other grocery stores, not to mentionWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT). Customers generally have limited loyalty to individual stores, and are intensely cost-sensitive. Think gas stations as a comparable business.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAs such, when food prices decline, grocery stores pass this along to customers. Otherwise, the store across the street does, and you lose your shoppers. Thus, when grocery prices fall, stores are forced to push through virtually all the potential cost savings. However, stores are stuck with fixed overhead. Lease costs, wages and other costs don't diminish when food prices fall. When total revenues fall then it ends up eating a fair chunk of the company's overall profitability. Whole Foods finds protection, to some degree, in its stronger brand, but it is not immune.Too Much Competition:There is a related issue; the sector now finds itself with too much competition. Grocery stores had a good period, particularly ones riding the organic trend. That caused management teams to expand heavily.Trader Joe's, for example, had just 300 stores in 2013. It's up to 460 now. And according to a recent Deutsche Bankcomparison, a basket of 77 similar products was priced 21% cheaper at Trader Joe's as compared with Whole Foods. Trader Joe's is hardly the only threat.Sprouts Farmers Market Inc(NASDAQ:SFM) has grown revenues 22% a year compounded over the past five years, and notched a 20% increase over the past 12 months.After this rapid expansion in the upscale grocery department, a period of store closings - or at minimum reduced growth - and retrenchment is needed to reduce the overall competition level and let profit margins tick up a few basis points.Expensive WFM Stock:Yes, I know WFM stock has lost roughly half its value since its 2013 peak. But that doesn't automatically make it cheap. In fact, WFM stock continues to trade at above a price-earnings ratio of 20. Sprouts, with its robust growth rate, trades at 20 times earnings as well. When given the option of a company growing at 20%/year such as Sprouts or Whole Foods with its shrinking earnings, you should generally pick the former.Grocery stores, due to their low margins, tend to trade at modest P/E ratios. Walmart is far more than just a grocery store, but it is a similar low-margin business and sells plenty of food. WMT stock is at just 14 times earnings. Pureplay grocer competitorKroger Co(NYSE:KR) trades at 16 times earnings. It's hard to argue for paying a premium on WFM stock given its recent operational issues.WFM Stock ProsFood Prices to Rise:I suspect the deflationary food price trend will reverse soon. To start with, there's an inflationary upturn in commodity prices generally. There's not necessarily any direct correlation between grains or meats prices and the hard commodities, however given the importance of input costs and also general investor sentiment across the asset class, one should expect firmer agricultural prices if the commodity rally continues.Trump is a plus for food prices if he generates more inflation generally. More specifically, cereals prices have been down for a long period of time. Corn prices, for example, have plunged since 2012. That benefits consumers directly. Americans eat tons of corn in various forms, and it also translates to lower feed prices, which has helped promote low meat and egg pricing. When corn goes up, it will boost food prices across the spectrum.365 Stores:Whole Foods is rolling out a new smaller store format. Named 365, after its private label branded products, these space-conscious 28,000 square foot stores are up to 50% cheaper to open and operate than the mainline Whole Foods locations.These smaller stores seem designed to compete more directly with Trader Joe's. And so far,it is working, at least according to management. The company claims it has seen many Trader Joe's bags turning up in the new 365 stores. In any case, Whole Foods plans to have several dozen of these stores up and running shortly.Decent Dividend:WFM stock used to be a classic growth play. Up above $50/share, most people involved held with high hopes of grocery market domination. The collapse in the growth story sent investors heading for the exits. At today's more conservative price, a lot less needs to go right to make WFM stock pay off.That's in part due to the increasingly attractive dividend. WFM stock yields 56 cents/share, amounting to a 1.9% yield. Not bad for a top brand, which, if things go right, may become a growth story again.VerdictIf you're looking for a trade in WFM stock, this is a decent place to consider. The margin pressures caused by falling food prices should begin to ease up soon.How Options Traders Nailed Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) EarningsWFM stock took a beating, and now looks oversold. As an investment, however, the valuation still looks iffy. And competition continues to mount an increasing threat to Whole Foods' margins in the long term.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned WMT stock. He had no position in WFM stock.

How Charles Schwab Is Becoming the Amazon of Investing;2/3/2017;"Amazon ( AMZN) has become a behemoth in the retail world.Sure, the company's most recent earnings report may have left a bit to be desired, but there is no denying how far Amazon has come in a few short years. The company easily dominates the consumer world, and it has left a variety of big box retailers in its wake in the process.While we can point to a number of reasons for Amazon's ascent, a key to their rise is clearly Amazon Prime. This subscription service-which costs $99/year-gives users free two day shipping, video content, music, and a number of other features as well. The deal is so good that some estimateclose to half of the country's households have a Prime account, with plenty of new subscribers now being added in foreign nations too.What is the point of this? Well, Prime members (at least in the U.S.)spend roughly twice as muchas non-Prime users on Amazon, while the service has an insane renewal rate in the United States,over 90% accordingto the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, so people are clearly seeing the value.But with so many services and offerings in the Prime package, how does Amazon make any money? Well, the idea is clearly to suck people in to the Amazon ecosystem via Prime, and then keep them there for years. And with such a high renewal rate and spending that is double non-Prime users, it is clearly paying off. One only needs to look at the demise of other retailers in a number of areas to understand just how much Amazon is dominating the consumer world these days.So, the strategy is to give people an offer that is too good to refuse in order to get them in the door and looking at higher margin products later on. AsJeff Bezos said, Prime is 'such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member'.The Amazon of Investing?We can see how Amazon has changed the world of retail and the consumer market, but is anyone doing the same thing for investing?I'd argue thatCharles Schwab( SCHW) is adopting this 'Amazon model' in the world of investing, and this is especially evident after their recent move.Their latest announcementbrought fees down to $6.95/trade from their previous spot at $8.95/trade, while Schwab also announced a fee cut on some of its broad market mutual funds, and that mutual fund costs would match their ETF counterparts too.The company will now charge 0.03% for its Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund ( SWPPX), while the Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund ( SWSSX) will cost 0.06% per year. Additionally, the company also reduced fees for its Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund down to 0.04% (which comes out later in February) to become an ultra-cheap choice in that market too. They also discussed the idea of reducing fees for the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF ( SCHP) and their fundamental index ETFs, but those changes will take place on March first.These cuts put Schwab's fees down to levels below its major competitors, Fidelity, E*Trade ( ETFC) andTD Ameritrade( AMTD), and it sent shockwaves throughout the industry. Share prices of ETFC and AMTD were down nearly 10% immediately following the announcement, while SCHW took a hit as well.I understand why the group was hit in the markets following the press release, as it definitely kicks off worries over a price war. And as for Charles Schwab, charging such rock bottom levels all but guarantees that Charles Schwab will lose money on its fund business, and it will probably see less revenues from its commissions in the process too.So Why Is This Like Amazon?To me, this is very reminiscent of the Amazon Prime service. You give people a ton of low cost options that are bound to please a wide range of people. So, instead of two day shipping and free video content, if you are in the investing world, you offer up fees that are less than major peers and nearly-free ETFs and mutual funds.The move gets plenty of people in the door, and it keeps them inside the ecosystem. Once you switch to Schwab for the low fees and start putting money in their ETFs and mutual funds, it becomes difficult to justify switching back. This is exactly like how you get used to the two-day shipping, music, Pantry, and other features from Amazon, keeping you stuck in the system. Charles Schwab, much like Amazon, realizes that winning over new customers is a vital part of this business, and that providing them low cost products is essential to keeping customers happy and away from the competition over the long-term.And once you have enough customers that you sucked in through the low price options, you now have the ability to earn money off them in different ways. Amazon does this with a variety of their media products and retail options in general (such as Pantry), though there are obviously some key differences between the retail and investing worlds.Schwab can do something similar to Amazon's approach nonetheless though. Bring people in for low cost index products and cheap trades, and then make the real profits off high margin activities that Amazon can only dream of. These include, investment management, servicing fees, and most importantly, investing the float.This last item will prove to be key for Schwab and other brokers, and especially if rates rise as most are expecting. For 2016, interest income accounted for roughly 44% of Schwab's net revenues, and that was in a year with mostly low-rates. Considering that trading revenue makes up about 11% of the total revenue (looking at 2016), and it is pretty reasonable to think that Schwab will be alright in the long term with a modest fee cut.I think that Schwab sees the same thing with the writing on the wall for a low rate environment. They are willing to sacrifice a bit in trading revenue now in order to get new users on the platform and get access to their potential asset base and the investable float that comes along with it. And if rates rise as most are expecting, this could prove to pay off, and especially considering that interest makes up a plurality of revenue already, and that is with rates at ultra-low levels.So, while Schwab might be down on this news now, it is a brilliant strategy in order to get more clients and capital in the door over the long haul. It is this type of forward thinking that has propelled Amazon to greatness in the consumer market, and it is about time someone tried this in the investing world as well.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amazon.com, Inc. Earnings: Profits March Higher... Again;2/3/2017;"Headed intoAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) fourth quarter, there was lots of uncertainty about what the e-commerce and cloud-computing company would report, particularly as it related to the company's profitability. But net income soared as operating income exceeded the high end of the company's guidance range.Here's a closer look at Amazon's soaring profits and its overall fourth-quarter results.makeArticleAd();Image source: Amazon.com.Amazon.com results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016Q4 2015Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$43.7 billion$35.7 billion22%Operating income$1.3 billion$1.1 billion13%Net income$749 million$482 million55%EPS$1.54$1.0054%Data source: Amazon fourth-quarter earningspress release. Table by author.What happened with Amazon this quarter?Revenue increased 22%, a rate that falls in the middle of management's ownforecastfor fourth-quarter revenue growth between 17% and 27%.For its seventh quarter in a row, Amazon was profitable. Net income was $749 million, up 55% form the year-ago quarter.Amazon's operating income was $1.3 billion, easily exceeding the company's forecast for fourth-quarter operating profits to be between $0 to $1.25 billion.Amazon's North America e-commerce business saw its operating income rise from $636 million in the year-ago quarter to $816 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.But the loss in Amazon's international e-commerce business widened from $108 million in the year-ago quarter to $487 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Amazon's cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), outperformed the company's North America e-commerce business when it comes to profitability. AWS' operating income increased from $580 million in the year-ago quarter to $926 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, accounting for 74% of the company's overall operating income.What management had to sayAmazon continued to make progress on its flywheel strategy of delivering value for Prime members across a growing suite of membership benefits. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explained Prime's success in the company's fourth-quarter earnings press release:Our Prime team's customer obsession kept them busy in 2016. Prime members can now choose from over 50 million items with free two-day shipping -- up 73% since 2015. Prime Video is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. Prime Now added 18 new cities, which means millions more members now get one and two hour delivery. New benefits were also added to the list, like Prime Reading, Audible Channels for Prime, Twitch Prime and more. And customers noticed -- tens of millions of new paid members joined the program in just this past year.AWS, which Amazon prides itself on its rate of innovation, released ""308 significant new services and features in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of launches in 2016 to 1,017,"" management said. This is up from 722 significant new services and features in 2015.Management continues to expect 2017 to be marked by a big step-up in investments. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky discussed these expected investments' impact on the company's first-quarter guidance during Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call (via a Reuterstranscript):[W]hat you are seeing ... is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about in prior calls about the fulfillment center step up.We had 26 warehouses we added last year, 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content, end marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to Amazon Fresh, and of course we're continuing to invest in Alexa in our Echo devices. And finally I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.For Amazon's first quarter of 2017, management said it expected revenue to be between $33.25 billion and $36.75 billion, up 14% to 23% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This guidance range, management emphasized, ""anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately $730 million or 250 basis points from foreign exchange rates."" In anticipation of an aggressive investment year, management expects operating income to be between $250 million and $900 million, down from $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2016.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Go With the Flow and Buy Progressive Corp (PGR) Stock;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsProgressive Corp(NYSE:PGR) is the nation's No. 4 property & casualty (P&C) insurance company. And of the three ahead of it, only one -Allstate Corp(NYSE:ALL) - is publicly traded.makeArticleAd();Source:meteo via FlickrGeico, which is No. 2 in the nation, is technically traded, but it's a part ofBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B), which holds a number of other businesses as well.State Farmis No. 1, commanding about 20% of the market. PGR has almost 9%.P&C insurers have been beneficiaries in the resurgence of the economy for a couple reasons.PGR Stock: A Bet on the U.S. EconomyFirst, a growing economy means people are spending. And in the U.S., that means people buy new cars, which means insurance companies get to insure more expensive vehicles, and that means higher premiums. That same goes for all the other toys PGR insures like all-terrain vehicles, boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketProgressive does have a property arm that offers homeowner and rental insurance, but its auto business is where its bread is buttered.Second, insurers collect premiums regularly. They then hold a good chunk of that in cash and cash equivalents, like U.S. Treasuries. The rest they invest in the markets to help increase the return on their capital.As interest rates rise, PGR is a beneficiary of the rising T-bond rates. This is a huge risk-free boon to Progressive's bottom line. And the market has been in rally mode as well, so its investments have likely helped drive earnings.But those two reasons make a very good argument for the P&C insurance industry as a whole. What makes PGR a uniquely good buy is its ability to grow its market share and stay innovative.For example, Progressive was online before even Google. PGR launched its site in 1995, set up its comparison shopping model in 1996 and was selling policies online by 1997. Google, nowAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), was founded in 1998.But PGR's roots go back to 1937. This 80-year-old company has seen some good and bad times over that life, and it has not only endured, but it has thrived. One key for its success is finding ways to innovate and differentiate itself from other insurers. For example, it was the first insurance company to offer plans to high-risk drivers - in 1956.By 1992, Progressive was the largest auto insurance seller through independent insurance agents. In 1994, it had an 800 number where you could call and get competitive quotes from PGR and three of its competitors. This is still a unique feature that Progressive offers among its competitors.How Options Traders Nailed Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) EarningsRecent fourth-quarter earnings show that all these factors are helping keep PGR moving forward. Revenue for the quarter was up almost 15%. Double-digit growth in this highly competitive sector is a very good sign indeed.While it has a steady if unexciting dividend around 1.8%, it's the growth that you can expect from Progressive that makes it interesting.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

How Options Traders Nailed Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Earnings;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a market known for its power of perfect pricing, nowhere is that more obvious than inAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But if you're looking for answers from AMZN stock, that's only one-half of this puzzling confirmation.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonIf you're an Amazon shareholder, Friday's early morning low of $801 - off more than 4% - wasn't exactly money in the bank. AMZN stock is on the defensive followinglast night's earnings release, which put investors into profit-taking mode.AMZN Stock by the NumbersAmazon reported better-than-expected profits of $1.54, beating the Street view by 17 cents. Sales, on the other hand, were short of estimates, at $43.7 billion versus a $44.68 billion bar. For the full year, though, profits quadrupled on a 27% increase in revenues.The company's operating income outlook has possibly raised some hairs on the backs of AMZN bulls. A forecast of $250 million to $900 million falls well below the Street's consensus of $1.33 billion. But it's not as bad as it looks, as most of the ""warning"" is tied to aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India.As well, while investors are failing to rejoice Friday, Amazon also delivered the goods with its operating cash flow, which jumped by 38% to $16.4 billion.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketWhat's more, revenues of $3.54 billion from its coveted Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit climbed an impressive 47% over last year's same-quarter result of $2.41 billion, while contributing 9% to Amazon's net revenues for the year.By the ""Other"" Numbers …That said, Amazon's report hasn't been nearly as punishing from the standpoint of professional options traders.Based on last night's 03 Feb $840 straddle market, pricing of $42 for the non-directional spread with AMZN stock at $840 amounted to traders putting the over/under bet at 5% or estimated range from $798 to $882. This weekly contract, which expires today, is the purest play on the earnings event and collectively tells us what traders expect for Amazon shares in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.Further, as most often it's the professional options traders and market makers that sell options premiums, the basic assumption is this more informed and disciplined group is collectively wagering on the ""under"" side of the 5% in AMZN stock.So far, not only has Friday's low of $801 in Amazon shares fallen within the forecast by options traders, but relative to past earnings events of the last few years, call and put premiums were decidedly below average.Thehistorical recordshows that over the past five years, the average up or down move in Amazon stock has been 8.4%, with a median reaction of 8.1%. Fine-tuning the price activity down to the last five quarters, AMZN's average move has been slightly higher at 9%, but a modestly lower median of 7.7%.AMZN Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeFinally, Friday's conditions in Amazon shares may not have been as fierce as we've been led to believe.Take a look at the accompanying chart. Ifcharts don't lie, then AMZN stockclearlywas a double-top pattern.I'm being facetious, of course. But even if I wasn't, I'd always look to hedge my directional bet with options and money management opportunities in case I read a chart like Amazon's with less-than-perfect forecasting.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Estimates;2/3/2017;"Amazon.com'sAMZNfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40.However, revenues of $43.74 billion lagged the consensus mark of $44.87 billion. The stock was down 4.15% in Thursday's after-hours trading in response to the lower-than-expected revenues, higher operating expenses and weak guidance.Over the last one year, the stock has however outperformed the Zacks  Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 56.63% compared with the industry's gain of 47.98%.Last quarter, despite an increase in operating expenses, the company showed much better financial discipline. The spike in operating expenses was due to buildout of fulfillment centers, and increased spending on original TV shows and movies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and India expansion-related expenses also resulted in higher spending.The North America and AWS segments contributed to profits while investments in international continued. Improvements in AWS were the result of operating efficiencies and increased utilization of assets.The numbers in detail-RevenuesAmazon reported revenues of $43.7 billion, up 33.7% sequentially and 22.4% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were at the mid-point of the guidance range of $42-$45.5 billion.For the full year, revenues were $136 billion, up 27% from $107 billion in 2015.Both product and service sales were up sequentially and year over year. Service sales grew much stronger than product sales from the year-ago quarter (up 43.7% compared with product sales growth of 15.1%). Revenue distribution between the two was 70%/30%.The company generated record sales during this year's holiday season, primarily led by its devices strategy. Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, Fire tablet and Amazon Echo topped the best-sellers list.Segment DetailsThe North America segment accounted for around 60% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 39% and 22%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 31.6% sequentially and 17.9% year over year. The AWS segment was up 9.4% sequentially and a massive 47% year over year with revenue share at nearly 8%.North America: Media was up 30% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. EGM was up 40.9% sequentially and 24.8% year over year. Other was up 42.6% sequentially and 80.4% year over year.International: Media was up 35.6% sequentially and 2.6% from last year. Sales from EGM were up 30.5% sequentially and 23.8% from last year. Other revenue was up 19.35% sequentially and 17.9% year over year.AWS: The business contributed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including McDonald's, Workday, Capital One, Salesforce, GE Oil & Gas, Kellogg's, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company, GPT Group, Hoya Corporation, Lionsgate, Macmillan Publishers India, RWE Czech Republic, and Bart & Associates Inc. Amazon ended the quarter with 42 available zones across 16 infrastructure regions. The Mumbai (India) region was added in the third quarter, which became the sixth region in the Asia Pacific. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of MicrosoftMSFT, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand AlphabetGOOGL.Gross MarginGross margin was down 122 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 189 bps year over year to 33.8%. Sequential variations in gross margin were largely mix-related, although increased investments were also a factor. Growth in AWS had a positive impact on margin. Pricing is also an important factor, given the increase in product categories all over the world and Amazon's strategy of heavily discounting products and services while building a position in any market. Third party sites did better than retail, which was also a positive.Gross profit dollars were up 29.8% from last year. The consistently rising gross profit dollars from the year-ago period reflects the success of Amazon's strategy.Net income was up 197.2% sequentially and 55.4% year over year.Operating MetricsAmazon's operating expenses of $13.5 billion were up 24.3% sequentially and 31.4% from the year-ago quarter. Amazon's heavy investing activities (headcount, fulfillment centers, content, etc) over the past few quarters have been driving up its costs. Cost of goods sold increased 121 bps sequentially as a percentage of sales with marketing expense increasing 45 bps and technology and content increasing just 5 bps. All other expenses declined as a percentage of sales.The net result was an operating margin of 2.9%, up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 bps from the year-ago quarter. Amazon reported an operating profit of $1.3 billion compared with $575 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.North America segment's operating margin of 3.1% was up 176 bps sequentially and 15 bps year over year. The International segment's operating margin of 4.07% shrank 315 bps sequentially but was up 100 bps from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin of AWS was 26.2%, down 46 bps sequentially but up 207 bps year over year.Consolidated segment operating income (CSOI) was up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAmazon generated fourth quarter net income of $749 million, or 1.7% of sales, compared with $252 million, or 0.8% in the previous quarter and $500 million, or 1.3% of sales in the same quarter last year. There were no one-time items in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the GAAP EPS was the same as the pro forma EPS of $1.54 compared with 52 cents in the previous quarter and $1 in the year-ago quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowAmazon ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $19.81 billion, down $146 million sequentially. The company generated $10.65 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.01 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $3 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1 billion in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues are expected to include a 250 bps positive FX impact and come in around $33.25-33.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $35.83 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $250-$900 million.To ConcludeRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenue but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS:Amazon Web Services on the other hand is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.IoT:Amazon has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth, in a very short time, backed by its Alexa-powered Echo devices. With third-party partnerships, Amazon is making Alexa the central point of connecting IoT devices used in any household. , It appears that Echo is well poised to penetrate every stream of business on the back of Amazon's robust performance.The company has accelerated signing on third-party device makers, so that these companies integrate Amazon's voice assistant - Alexa - which brings them into the respective eco systems.Currently, Alexa is equipped with thousands of skills and can connect to any stream of business. We believe that Amazon has just started to unfold what it could do with Alexa.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Amazon Fails to Impress Post Q4 Results: Will ETFs Suffer?;2/3/2017;"After the closing bell on Thursday, online e-commerce behemoth AmazonAMZNdisappointed investors as holiday-quarter sales fell short of our expectations. The company also provided a downbeat outlook due to increased spending on warehouses, movies and gadgets. However, it came up with an earnings surprise of 10% (read:ETFs to Ride on Amazon's Best Ever Holiday Season).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Q4 Results in DetailThe company reported earnings per share of $1.54, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 and increasing from the year-ago quarter of $1.00. Revenues climbed 22% year over year to $43.7 billion missing our estimate of $44.9 billion.The fast-growing cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS) remained the bright spot during the quarter. Notably, revenues from AWS rose 47% year over year to $3.54 billion (see:all the Technology ETFs here).Amazon is in the midst of another period of aggressive spending, which will weigh on its profitability.

The mid-point is below analysts' expectation of $35.95 billion as polled by Reuters and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.83 billion.Despite the earnings beat, concerns over big spending unnerved investors, pushing shares of AMZN down as much as 4.6% in after-market hours.

Earnings Make Long Term Case For Visa (V) And MasterCard (MA);2/3/2017;"Back at the end of November last year, I wrotean articlesuggesting that those bullish on the prospects for “Cyber Monday” should consider playing their belief in a way less obvious than simply buying stock in Amazon (AMZN). The argument then was that the expectations for, and indeed the valuation of, Amazon were such that even a decent holiday period for the online retailer could provoke only a so-so reaction, whereas any hint of weakness could see the stock punished.My suggestion then was that investors should consider the major credit card companies MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) instead. Now that Q4 earnings for all of the companies concerned are out that seems to have played out pretty well, and the case for V and MA remains strong.To recap the card companies’ earnings, MasterCard, who released on Monday, reported numbers that were essentially in line, with a small beat of EPS and a small miss in revenue terms, but highlighted by sales growth of nearly ten percent on an annual basis. Visa reported last night and beat on both the top and bottom lines, while also reporting noticeable growth.makeArticleAd();Some are quoting the fact that transactions processed by Visa increased by 39% over last year, but that is not a direct comparison as the latest number includes transactions from Visa Europe, while last year’s did not. A more reliable indicator of growth is U.S. transactions, which increased by a not too shabby 12%.What makes both V and MA such good long term plays for investors, though, is the big picture circumstances that seem to be inexorably moving in their favor.Online shopping continues to increase exponentially, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, and, despite the best efforts of PayPal (PYPL) and others, credit and debit cards remain the go to payment method for online shoppers. Visa and MasterCard combined account forover 85%of global payment volume in general, so even if online shopping growth stalls for some unforeseeable reason, both companies look set to continue growing.At some point it is possible that Bitcoin or some other virtual currency will gain ground and do damage to that dominance, but at the moment that looks far enough away to not present a realistic problem to investors.As I pointed out in the above referenced article, one of the strongest features of the earnings for both Visa and MasterCard is that they have spectacular margins, nudging 40% in both cases. The wider implementation of new technology such as microchip based transactions will possibly hold those margins back for a while, but in the long run will increase profitability by reducing the incidence of fraud.Of course, if the entire global economy slows then card payments will suffer along with everything else, but the cyclical nature of economics can’t be avoided. The simple fact is that, as these recent earnings releases have demonstrated, as long as people continue to buy things, and especially as those purchases continue to shift towards e-commerce, both Visa and MasterCard will continue to grow. On that basis they are stocks that should be a part of everyone’s long term portfolio."
Stronger Jobs at 227K, Unemployment Ticks Up to 4.8%;2/3/2017;"Friday, February 3, 2017makeArticleAd();Ahead of the opening bell this Friday, new non-farm payroll jobs numbers were released from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), with 227K new jobs created in the month of January, up from the consensus 174K expected from analysts. The unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 4.8%, due to an increase in labor force participation.Average hourly earnings did rise again, but only by 0.1%. This figure year over year is +2.5%. Is it keeping up with inflation? Just barely. Look for this metric to continually increase in importance as these monthly jobs numbers become more clearly representative of the Trump administration.Revisions to the past two months were rather considerable: +1000 jobs in December to 157K, but down 40K in November to 164K, an overall revision of -39K new jobs over the past quarter year.Industry by industry, Retail brought in the highest number of new hires at 46K, followed by Construction at 36K. Government hiring was the biggest loser, -10K, marking the second straight decline in government employment. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.9%, up 0.2%. The U6 read - sometimes referred to as ""real unemployment"" - rose to 9.4% after several months in a row lower.The Trump administration talks a lot about bringing in lots of news jobs, but we're looking a little tight in the U.S. labor force these days. For sure there are plenty of Uber drivers who'd rather be employed full-time elsewhere (not to pick on Uber, but to use them as a modern example of American labor), and it is encouraging that more out-of-work citizens have begun to seek out new employment once again. But skill-sets matching job openings looks to be one of the biggest concerns.We've seen a lot of executive orders from Trump so far in the early days of his administration, but nothing yet on his promised infrastructure program (which will presumably include building a big wall on our southern border, but may also include repairing bridges, airports, etc. throughout the country). These jobs ought to be forthcoming, but it's tough for analysts to include in their models at this point. How much money will Congress allot to such ends? No one really knows at this stage.A shortage of skilled labor in the Construction sector is something that the administration and Congress may wish to address in bringing new funds to blue-collar America's workforce. But will it? Another unknown at this point.HersheyHSYand CloroxCLXboth beat earnings ahead of the bell today. This follows Amazon'sAMZNearnings beat after the closing bell Thursday, in which the online retail giant missed revenue estimates for the quarter.Pre-market trading is up following the BLS report: S&P +10 points, the Dow +90 and Nasdaq +17.

Is Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock a Trade or an Investment?;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO), which went public in June, is a Henry Higgins for apps. Just as Professor Higgins transformed Eliza Doolittle from a poverty-soaked wretch into a great beauty inPygmalion, orMy Fair Ladyif you prefer the musical, so TWLO transforms Web apps from empty nothings to bright lights and dazzle.  Twilio does this by giving them a voice, video and messaging platform, delivered as a service, through the cloud, offloading these functions asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) offloads the cloud itself.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrThe question for Twilio stock investors is, how many companies need this and how many can use this? Just how many Eliza Doolittle apps are there, and how fast can they be found?When TWLO stock delivers its earnings on Feb. 7, we'll have a clue, and most analysts don't think they will like the answer. They expect revenue of just $73.92 million, and a loss of 5 to 6 cents per share, a narrow loss but no real growth, certainly nothing worth a market cap of $2.63 billion.Twilio Stock Is a BattlegroundThe pessimism is borne out of how quickly the app business is consolidating around a few huge companies which, likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), have the size to deliver these functions on their own, and which don't need to rent them.This has made TWLO stock a battleground stock, subject to wild swings of fortune. After going public in June with a first trade at $21.30, Twilio stock rose to nearly $69 per share by late September before plunging to $26.50 in early January, opening for trade Feb. 3 at around $30.50.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryIt was ""a frumpy New Year"" in the words of InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto. At $28 per share, he saw the downside riskas greaterthan the upside potential. InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler agrees, suggesting you don't even nibble until TWLO stock tests its low of $23.66and bounces off it.After all, you don't want to buyanotherFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE).Joseph Hargett is more bullish, saying buyers arelined up to buyonce earnings come out. Facebook itself is at the center of his uncertainty. TWLO is part of Facebook Messenger, but it has no contract with Facebook, which can cancel its deal at any time. Hargett offers two ways to play the volatility with options.Richard Saintvilus, by contrast, is a straight-on bull, saying Twilio stock could hit $40 withjust a little patience.TWLO itself runs in the Amazon cloud, and should be able to access Amazon's cloud customers, he writes, helping them deliver voice notifications and text messages, which enhance security, providing access management features at low cost.TWLO Stock Dances With WolvesMy view is that Twilio stock is dancing with wolves, which makes it both more enticing and more dangerous. Proving your value to the wolf without the wherewithal to attract your own pack, after all, can quickly turn you into wolf food.I suspect analysts are looking too much at TWLO's next earnings report and not enough at its real business model, seeing it as a trade rather than an investment.Twilio is in the business of having programmers find creative solutions for common app problems within the cloud and selling those solutions by subscription. It's possible that Facebook may find another way around the secure sign-in problem, but TWLO CEO Jeff Lawson is building a shop that canfind other problems and other solutions, then deliver them.Why Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is Starting to Pick Up Its GrooveIn other words, if you're bullish on Twilio stock, you don't just believe it can bring in revenue and profit from its current offerings, but that it can use its relationships to find problems and develop solutions that go beyond disaster response and helping users get back their passwords. To return to the beginning of this piece, you believe Eliza will marry Professor Higgins and find a happy ending.TWLO stock is a bet on cloud application development and on the model of selling solutions through the cloud, using the cloud's own self-service model. It's a bet Facebook and Amazon themselves are willing to make, one that has a longer time horizon than just next week.I think a longer-term investor should be willing to play it that way, too. If you're betting on Twilio stock, you're betting on Jeff Lawson's development vision. TWLO stock is about the jockey, not the horse.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

GoPro (GPRO) Q4 Results Mixed with Earnings Beat & View Cut;2/3/2017;"After four back-to-back quarters of posting quarterly losses,GoPro, Inc.GPROmanaged to get back in the green as it posted adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share in its fourth-quarter 2016 results. The action camera maker's bottom-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents by an impressive 33%.However, the earnings figure was a result of several adjustments made to the huge GAAP loss that GoPro reported (82 cents per share).Shares tumbled almost 14% at one point in late trading in the aftermath of the results, as investors were disillusioned with the company's bleak sales outlook for first-quarter 2017. This was in spite of the fact that this was the second biggest quarter in terms of revenue in GoPro's history. The drab guidance must have spooked investors as 2017 was supposed to be a turnaround time for GoPro and this is a terrible start to the same.In addition, investors were likely upset with the multiple missed opportunities and goof-ups that GoPro had this quarter.The huge GAAP loss of 82 cents for the quarter was much wider than the 25 cents loss generated in the comparable quarter last year.For full-year 2016, the company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $1.44 per share, in stark contrast to net income of 76 cents in 2015.Inside the HeadlinesGoPro's revenues grew 23.8% from the prior-year quarter's tally to $540.6 million. This marked the company's return to revenue growth after four successive quarters of sales declines. The top-line figure still lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $576 million.This was the first quarter that reflected the performance of the recently launched Hero5 camera and its consumer drone Karma, and revenues were far short of the company's earlier guidance of $625 million. The Karma recall hit the top line and manufacturing issues related to Hero5 camera also strained growth.Nevertheless, Hero5 Black was the best-selling digital imaging device in units and dollars in the U.S. and Europe. Also, Hero5 Black sold more units in a single quarter in Europe, in this quarter, than any other GoPro camera ever.For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margins expanded 990 bps year over year to 39.5%. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $31.6 million, as against an operating loss of $21.6 million generated last year.R&D expenses were up almost 40% year over year, driven by investment in HERO5 cameras, Karma, accessories and software. In addition, sales and marketing expenses shot up 36% year over year.The company recently launched GoPro Plus - a cloud-based subscription service - that enables auto-upload of footage from a GoPro camera to a GoPro Plus cloud account for on-the-go access, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app. Even though it is early days, the GoPro Plus is enjoying high retention rates in the U.S. and its subscriber base seems to be expanding.In the quarter, the rebranded Quik mobile app was downloaded over 4 million times (up almost 30% sequentially), as its active users and monthly exports tripled in Dec 2016 over the prior year.For full-year 2016, revenues plunged 26.8% year over year to $1.62 billion.Notable DevelopmentsTill date, GoPro's Hero 5 Black cameras and Karma drones have faced production issues and delayed shipments, which restrained the company's ability to meet demand in the quarter. The company's new products also had a rocky start with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, as GoPro had temporarily stopped selling them on the e-commerce site in mid October due to a pricing dispute.Further, supply constraints made retailers cancel marketing support of GoPro's new products, particularly its new Hero 5 camera, which obviously hurt revenues. Further, the company had to announce a recall of its new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of its commercial launch, as a few of them lost power during flight due to battery issues. This was also a huge setback for the company.However, earlier this week, the company resumed Karma sales and the company plans to ramp production further. Karma is scheduled to be available in international markets this spring. We believe that GoPro is well set to capitalize on the fast-growing consumer drone market.The company also launched several accessories during the quarter, including Karma Grip, a handheld stabilizer; Remo, a waterproof, voice-activated remote and Quik Key, a microSD card reader enabling quick editing and sharing from smartphones.LiquidityExiting the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $192.1 million, down significantly from $280 million a year back.GuidanceIn light of such unfortunate events and uncertain market reaction, the company gave a very disappointing guidance for first-quarter 2017. It projects revenues for the current quarter in the range of $190-$210 million, which is well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268 million for the quarter. The company expects gross margin in the low 30% range.GoPro refrained from offering specific revenue or margin guidance for full-year 2017.However, GoPro declared plans to limit its adjusted operating expenses in 2017 to $600 million, in an attempt to try to return to full-year profitability next year. This is comparable to a 2016 figure of about $709 million.GoPro should be able to attain these massive cost reductions, in light of its recent business restructuring, which did away with many high-cost operations including its entertainment division.It is likely that GoPro's sales will gradually improve as it ramps production and expands Karma's reach to international markets. This will supplement its cost-reduction initiatives and enable it to achieve sustained, profitable growth.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIn recent months, the company has been grappling to achieve its earlier growth and go beyond its trademark action cameras. GoPro had earlier reduced its inventory of older legacy cameras, in order to prepare for its new products. However, what followed was more operational stumbles and messed-up products launches.The company has also been facing pressure to establish a more mainstream market for its cameras. However, tough competition from smartphone brands such as Apple Inc.AAPLand Samsung Electronics Corp. has been making it difficult for the company.Despite all the problems that GoPro is straining under, the company is confident of strong demand trajectory for its latest products and is expecting to return to double-digit growth in 2017.However big the issues it faces, GoPro still boasts an enviable retail presence. Extremely few consumer technology companies have the kind of retail presence that GoPro has and this might work in favour of the company.

KLA-Tencor, Iconix Brand Group and Amazon highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/3/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 03, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsKLA-Tencor(NASDAQ:KLAC-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day andIconix BrandGroup (NASDAQ:ICON-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:KLA-Tencor(NASDAQ:KLAC-Free Report) recently beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and then guided Wall Street higher which has sent estimate higher. This has caused the Zacks Rank to move up to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and today it is the Bull of the Day.The last several months have been very good ones to the semiconductor stocks. It looks like there is evidence that the run will continue if not pick up speed. Other high profile names have seen renewed interest from analysts as Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Driving, and 3-D Virtual Reality concepts begin to move from beta into the mainstream. This is all good news for the chip industry.DescriptionKLAC is a semiconductor capital equipment company, they make the equipment that will help the chip companies make their chips.Recent EarningsKLA Tencor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 by $0.11 in posting earnings of $1.52. That translates into a positive earnings surprise of 7.8% marking the 10th straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Guidance called for revenue of between $860M - $920M when the consensus estimate was calling for $849M. As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks, this is what I love to see. Also on the call, management noted that they expect CY17 gross margin to be a ""couple hundred basis points"" better than previously expected.It world of beating and raising this stock has higher revenues and higher margins. Usually, when that happens you see higher multiples. Speaking of multiples, KLAC trades at 15.6x forward estimates and over the last two years the stock has traded between 13.2x and 17.8x. This tells me that the stock could go as high as $109 (17.8*6.17) if it trades at the high end of the range over the last two years.Room for Upgrades for KLACOne thing that I like to see is a stock that has room for future catalysts. KLAC has three brokerages that have ""Hold"" or equivalent ratings on the stock. Instinet is by far the most bearish of the three with a price target of $78 and a neutral rating. Stifel Nicolaus has a hold and a price target of $83. A few days after the most recent report Deutsche Bank reiterated their ""Hold"" on the stock and increased their price target from $78 to $85.Goldman Sachs, Cowen and Company, Credit Suise, B. Riley and Needham all have KLAC at either ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" or the equivalent. Of those, B. Riley is the most bullish with a $106 price target and Needham is just a dollar behind at $105.The Big Tell for KLACOver the years I have picked up on the lingo for chip stocks. At first I learned all about book to bill and after that the focus became backlog. More recently I have picked up an even bigger tell than a stock with records billings or record backlog. The phrase that pays is ""design wins.""During the most recent conference call management spoke the phrase that pays when talking to 3D NAND. If there is anything that is as good as a design win, I have yet to know what it is. This ensures some high margin business over the next 6 to 18 months, and that alone should have the multiple for this stock increasing.Bear of the Day:Iconix BrandGroup (NASDAQ:ICON-Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and it is the Bear of the Day. Let's take a look at why the stock is the Bear of the Day and if there are some trends that might help investors avoid other stocks that could become a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).DescriptionICON is a brand management company. The Company's brand portfolio includes brands, such as Candie's, Bongo, Joe Boxer, Rampage, Mudd, London Fog, Mossimo, Ocean Pacific/OP, Danskin/Danskin Now, Rocawear/Roc Nation, Cannon, Royal Velvet, Fieldcrest, Charisma, Starter, Waverly, Ecko Unltd/Mark Ecko Cut & Sew, Zoo York, Umbro, Lee Cooper, Strawberry Shortcake and Artful Dodger, and interests in Material Girl, Peanuts, Ed Hardy, Truth or Dare, Modern Amusement, Buffalo, Nick Graham Hydraulic and PONY brands.Recent EarningsIt isn't too often that a Bear of the Day has a good earnings history. Usually I see a bunch of misses but ICON has 3 straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is pretty good.EstimatesEstimate revision are the key to the Zacks Rank. As estimates fall, so does the Rank. The current quarter estimates is at $0.14, but that is down from $0.19 about 90 days ago. The current year estimate of $1.11 is down 2 cent from about 90 days ago as well. Both of those items don't help, but the real issue here is the move in 2017 estimates.The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from $1.08 to $1.00 in the last thirty days. That move lower is what has pushed this stock down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings In-Depth: AWS Growth SlowsE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) just released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results.

Expectations are for 175,000 jobs added on the month and an unemployment rate of 4.7%. Additionally, the financial sector is seeing activity as the Trump administration promises to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act that was enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.46%,S&P 500futures had gained 0.44% andNasdaq-100futures were higher by 0.31%.On the options front, volume arrived a touch below average on Thursday, with about 14.7 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.61 while the 10-day moving average held at a three-month high of 0.69.Turning to Thursday's volume leaders,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) saw a rise in put activity ahead of last night's quarterly report that may have been smart money, as AMZN stock is down roughly 4% in premarket trading. Elsewhere,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) calls were active after RBC Capital Markets lifted their price target on the shares. Finally,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) call volume soared on earnings speculation as the loomingSnapIPO drew attention to the social media sector.Amazon.com, Inc.

Adding to AMZN's woes was weaker-than-expected guidance first-quarter guidance, with Amazon expecting revenue in a range of $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion, versus the consensus view of $36 billion.Apparently feeling that there was a bit too much hype in the air ahead of the event, AMZN options traders favored puts in the run up to earnings.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Going to Bounce;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the dithering dance continued in theS&P 500this week, the energy sector was quietly raided by sellers. And therein lies opportunity. With heavy hitters likeExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) now resting near critical support levels, the time for a bullish rebound is nigh. Let's take a deep dive into XOM stock and build a high-probability option trade to capitalize on its current setup.makeArticleAd();For starters, the price trend for Exxon Mobil over the past six months has been … well, trendless. Ever since the stock peaked in mid-July last year, it has been mired in a trading range. As illustrated in the accompanying chart, the $82 zone has become a significant support level halting each and every downturn.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixAnd guess what? The dastardly descent gripping XOM this year is now knocking on the door of this support level.Traders waiting for confirmation that buyers would defend their turf need wonder no longer. Yesterday's big hammer candle proved that the bulls are indeed willing to put up a fight. The beautiful thing about stock prices leaning against key support or resistance levels is the ability it provides traders to structure low-risk, high-reward trades.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketFor example, if we purchased XOM stock with a stop-loss just below $82, then the risk per share is minimal. And if the mighty oil king travels even halfway to the top of its price range, we're looking at a high-potential reward per share.How to Trade XOM Stock HereWhile equity traders could go with a straight stock purchase, options traders can play XOM stock with a bit more finesse. If you're looking for a bit of an edge in your trade, consider using the bull put strategy.Sell the XOM Mar $80 put for 78 cents while buying the Mar $77.50 put for 37 cents. The net credit received upon trade entry is the 41 cents and represents the maximum reward available. If Exxon stock sits above $80 at March expiration, you will capture the gain.The max risk is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net credit, or $2.09. You will lose this amount if XOM stock sits below $77.50 at expiration. To minimize the damage, you could exit early if the stock falls below $80.As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceShould You Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsBuy Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Ways Shopify Is Like Amazon and 1 Key Difference;2/3/2017;"Image source: Shopify.commakeArticleAd();Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a tremendous investment for shareholders.   Since the company went public in 1997, its stock has grown over   54,000% and the company is now one of thetop five most valuable companiesby market capitalization. People are always looking for companies   that are set to succeed as well as Amazon has, and that leads me   to Mark Twain, who is credited with saying that ""history doesn't   repeat itself, but it often rhymes.""Taking a Twain approach to finding the next Amazon-like   investment,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP)  comes to the forefront as sharing three   success factors with Amazon while having one critical difference   that might put it at a disadvantage in terms of growing to   Amazon's size.SimilaritiesDifferenceFounder-led with long-term vision.Obsessed with customers' experience.Investing aggressively for growth.Shopify's total addressable market is much smaller             than Amazon's.Let's compare these three success factors and the one   difference to see how Amazon-like Shopify really is.Founder-led with long-term visionA founder can have a significant impact in shaping the culture   of a company. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO and founder, did this   early in the company's history by emphasizing in his first letter   to shareholders his determination to have his company succeed   over the long term.We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be     the shareholder value we create over the long term. This     value will be a direct result of our ability to extend     and solidify our current market leadership position. The     stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our     economic model.Tobi Lutke, Shopify's founder and CEO, has a similar mandate.   Lutke's letter to shareholders in the company's 2015 public   filing declared long-term value more important than the short   term.In order to build long-term value, we decided to forgo     short-term revenue opportunities and nurture the people who     were putting their trust in Shopify. ... This is a prime     example of how we approach value and something that potential     investors must understand: we do not chase revenue as the     primary driver of our business. ... we have always prioritized     long-term value over short-term revenue opportunities.Having the long-term view has paid off for Amazon and its   shareholders, and it seems that Shopify has the same mindset.   Lutke boldly ended his letter to shareholders saying, ""I want   Shopify to be a company that sees the next century."" How's that   for the long-term view?Obsessed with the customer experienceAs a longtime customer of Amazon, I have seen the customer   experience get better and better. Enhancements in search,   ordering experience, fulfillment, account management, and   surprise extras seem commonplace. This is not by accident. Bezos   used the phrase ""obsess over customers"" in his first shareholder   letter and he has not relented on his passion for pleasing   customers. He includes the original 1997 shareholder letter every   year in Amazon's annual report.Similarly, Shopify understands its success is tied to the   success of its customers. Whereas Amazon's customers are   consumers, Shopify's customers are merchants selling their goods   on Shopify's e-commerce platform. Like Amazon, the idea of   customer focus has been core to Shopify from the beginning. Lutke   has a letter on the Shopify investor home page where he describes   Shopify's focus on the customer. It says in part:Shopify is exactly this: the only platform you need to build     your empire. Shopify is the first thing our merchants log into     in the morning and the last thing they log out of in the     evening. It's at the heart of their business -- a     responsibility that we take very seriously. ... our job is to     make our merchants look their very best in every interaction     they have with consumers.Shopify's success is aligned with the success of its   customers. When Shopify's customers are successful, Shopify makes   more money in subscription and transaction fees. Shopify has   provided significant resources to help its clients run successful   e-commerce businesses, including company-facilitated   customer meet-ups, a user community, video how-to guides, a   podcast, and even a directory of Shopify experts that merchants   can use for almost any aspect of e-commerce   business. Lastly, even if the core Shopify platform doesn't   meet your needs, Shopify hosts an app store with over 1,500   apps.  Shopify's relentless focus on the customer continues   today. Lutke mentioned in the most recent earnings release: ""Our   accomplishments over the last few months support the strategy we   have made clear from the beginning, which is to do the things   that help merchants succeed""Shopify scores a checkmark in the first two Amazon keys to   success. Let's look at the third success factor and how Shopify   shares a similar aggressive investment strategy with the   e-commerce and could-computing titan.Investing aggressively to growAmazon didn't report a profit until 2003, which was six long   years after going public. The reason Amazon didn't post a profit   was because it was investing heavily to grow its business.Amazon has continued to invest in its business and this   impacted the company's most recent quarter. Amazon cited   investments in fulfillment centers, digital content,   international growth, Alexa/Echo, and AWS asreasons for lower profit in Q3.Shopify hasn't posted a profit as long as it's been reporting   results publicly. But, as I noted inthis article, Shopify's core business has healthy gross margins and could be   profitable if it weren't investing heavily in growth   initiatives. In Shopify's filing to go public, Shopify   provided detail about these investments including:Marketing activities.Expanding partner referral programs.Research and development to introduce new products and     services.Maintaining a high level of merchant service and     support.Data center and network infrastructure.In its most recent earnings call Chief Financial Officer Russ   Jones directly linked these investments to Shopify's ability to   continue grow.... we believe the primary reason we will continue to gain     share of this growing pie is ... our strategic focus on     merchant success. This means continually reevaluating the     platform capabilities necessary for merchants to thrive at     every stage of growth and also investing in the partnerships     and projects that we believe will help future-proof their     success.Shopify scores a win on all three of these Amazon success   factors, but there's one important difference between Amazon and   Shopify that investors need to keep in mind.Total addressable marketImage source: Amazon.comAmazon's logo has an arrow starting at the ""a"" in its name and   going to the ""z"", which is a subtle reminder that Amazon wants to   make its website the place consumers go to buy just about   anything.While Shopify is an e-commerce business like Amazon, Shopify   doesn't sell goods to consumers. Shopify provides a suite of   e-commerce tools to enable entrepreneurs and small-business   owners to start and run an e-commerce business quickly and   simply. Shopify makes money from subscription fees from these   business owners and transaction fees when they sell goods over   the Shopify platform.Retail e-commerce is estimated to reach more than $4 trillion   in the next few years, giving Amazon a huge total addressable   market (TAM). Shopify's TAM is more modest. Shopify provided TAM   details about the small and medium business (SMB) market it   serves in the company's filing to go public.... we focus on selling to SMBs. We have merchants in     approximately 150 countries... According to AMI Partners, in     2014, there were approximately 10 million merchants with less     than 500 employees operating in our key geographies, and     approximately 46 million such merchants worldwide.At the time, Shopify estimated that its annualized revenue per   merchant was about $1,000. Given that as a baseline, Shopify's   total addressable market in its key geographies would be $10   billion, and worldwide would be $46 billion. Shopify goes on to   say that its market will expand as more entrepreneurs start   businesses and as Shopify gains more revenue per merchant. Given   that Shopify's trailing-12-month revenue is $329 million, Shopify   still has plenty of room to grow.Shopify looks and acts a lot like Amazon, and that's a really   good thing for investors. Despite the difference in the   companies' total addressable markets, investors should be excited   about Shopify's Amazon-like traits in the large and growing   e-commerce marketplace.10 stocks we like better than ShopifyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Stock: The Long-Awaited Breakout?;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of global pharmaceutical companyMerck & Co., Inc.(NYSE:MRK) rallied 3.35% on Thursday on the back of its latest quarterly financial results. MRK stock has largely been trotting sideways since August of last year despite two breakout attempts to the upside and a couple of scares of breaking down.makeArticleAd();Hastily chasing stocks higher before they show clear chart breakouts is a sure way to lose money in them markets, but Thursday's price action in Merck stock is worth giving the benefit of the doubt.For its fourth quarter, Merck earned 42 cents per share - a notable improvement over the 35 cents it earned in the same period a year ago. The company's financial guidance for fiscal year 2017 was roughly in line, and I for one couldn't detect any major outstandingly positives nor negatives in the report. However, sales of the company's Keytrude cancer drug looked strong.I often say that when it comes to the stock market, one can learn a lot by just watching. That breakout attempt by MRK stock on Thursday might be telling us more than the financial results did.When Ilast discussed shares of Merck on Jan. 4, I pointed to the previous day's bullish reversal and offered that a next upside target around the $62 could soon come to fruition. A few days later, MRK reached this upside price target.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryUntil yesterday, Feb. 2, the stock then mostly pushed sideways.MRK Stock ChartsLooking at Merck through a long-term lens, we see that the area around $62-$64 has been serving as significant technical resistance for the stock since the early 2000s.Click to EnlargeFrom this perspective, we can see that MRK stock has been consolidating below this area of resistance once again since last summer. This could be a coiling-up before ultimately breaking higher in a more meaningful way.On the daily chart, we see this sideways move since last summer in more detail. Note the two breakout fake-out attempts last October and again in November.Click to EnlargeOn Jan. 3, MRK stock bounced off its 200-day simple moving average (red) after marginally closing below it the previous day. Yesterday's rally served as a second leg higher following the Jan. 3 rally. It also marginally pushed the stock out of the blue box on the chart, but not yet above the two aforementioned breakout fake-out highs from last fall.Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings DipLess risk-averse traders could look to initiate a long position in Merck stock in hopes of follow-through buying in coming days while respecting any major bearish reversal as a stop loss signal.More patient traders may first want to see if MRK can hold above the $63.50 area for several days before buying shares for a push toward the high $60s.Like what you see?

Here’s Why I Still Like Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) made headlines last week as the first major oil company to report fourth-quarter earnings. But while the company swung to profitability thanks to higher revenue and lower costs, 2016's depressed oil prices kept the numbers well below what Wall Street had been steeled to expect.makeArticleAd();Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Let's take a closer look. On the one hand, earnings of 22 cents a share were a nice improvement from last year's loss of 31 cents a share.On the other, consensus estimates were for 64 cents a share. Revenue grew more than 7.5% to $31.5 billion, but that was still below analysts' expectations of $33.3 billion.The weakness was largely the result of one-time charges CVX incurred in the quarter, which totaled $872 million. However, the company does not adjust its results to account for that.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryCVX lost 27 cents a share in the full year, which CEO John Watson attributed to the low oil and gas prices the industry experienced in 2016. He also said that the company cut costs by $14 billion last year, which has it positioned to improve results this year. Full-year revenue came in at $114.47 billion.Looking ahead, management indicated that they were considering further asset sales as well as cutting their capital budget again should prices remain depressed. Results may have been short when looking at the specific numbers, but everyone was well aware that they would be impacted by the low oil and gas prices in 2016.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EWhile the stock closed the day of its report down 2.4% and has continued drifting since, I still like this stock as a longer-term investment on higher oil prices. It's also a great income holding.CVX has dipped below its 50-day moving average, but I like that it remains solidly above the 200-day, which is a level it's held since March 2016. I think the selling is overdone at this point, and the stock's sizable 3.8% dividend yield only adds to its attractiveness in the wait for higher prices.Curious what Wall Street insider Charles Payne really thinks?Get more behind-the-scenes insights, valuable market research and hands-on guidance including live stock recommendations from Fox Business's rising star.

Stock Exchange: Navigation Help For The Challenging Trump Waters;2/3/2017;"ByJeff Miller:Our lastStock Exchange(two weeks ago) discussed diverse ideas from our experts, and also explained why I vetoed one of the recommendations. When trading using models, you can link directly to a platform if you do many trades and have a very short time frame. Otherwise, you should not blindly follow the model. A human who understands the factors used by the model can identify when a situation is truly exceptional.The current market environment is all about Trump - perhaps excessively so. Everyone worries about what companies are vulnerable to a tweet (which we will call aT-WOP, HT @corporatecommie). Each day includes more speculation about companies that might benefit from policy changes.How should traders find a sweet spot in this environment?makeArticleAd();This week includes both new ideas and reviews of some past highlights. Everyone can benefit from finding the trading model most relevant for your own style.Let's look at the ideas from our experts. As usual, I will conclude with a brief observation.Getting UpdatesWe have a new (free) service to subscribers to our Felix/Oscar update list. You can suggest three favorite stocks and sectors. We report regularly on the ""favorite fifteen"" in each category - stocks and sectors - as determined by readers. Sign up with email to ""etf at newarc dot com."" Suggestions and comments are welcome. In the tables below, green is a ""buy,"" yellow a ""hold,"" and red a ""sell."" Each category represents about 1/3 of the underlying universe. Please remember that these are responses to reader requests, not necessarily stocks and sectors that we own. Sign up now to vote your favorite stock or sector onto the list!This Week-Finding Your Trading Sweet SpotHolmesThis week I'm buying good ol' U.S.A. Macys (M). This stock probably needs no introduction - Main Street retail store.This chart strikes me as a great money-making opportunity. My major concern is that this stock keeps making lower lows, but in the meantime, it can have some terrific rallies. I see no reason it can't get back to the mid-$30s. It's a little comforting to know that there are 18 analyst holds on this stock and their target price is STILL $36. That is consistent with what the charts are telling me.I'm buying here with a tight stop, $29.25, and looking for a move back into the mid-$30s, giving me a nice risk/reward setup.J: I agree with you about ignoring the analyst ratings. I use it as a contra-indicator. Did you read that recent WSJ article?H: You know that I do not read! I reach great conclusions from looking at charts. You humans read, but mostly to reaffirm your existing biases.J: I am delighted that our clients caught this at a lower price, but do you realize the stock was up over $1.50 today?H: No. I am enjoying the beach in Mexico. I sent in my pick, but that is like working overtime.J: Oscar's turf accountant would call your choice ""past posting.""H: Sorry. You are the one who set the schedule for Thursdays. I made the pick earlier, and it is still a good buy.J: There is a rumor of a possible takeover. Did you know about that?H: No. I just know a great rebound chart when I see one.J: Are you going to have any trouble returning from Mexico? The U.S. is taking a hard look at those returning from other countries.H: My papers are all in order. I'll be back in the office in a week or so.AthenaI admit it. I still have no new picks. We do not have the fresh, strongly trending stocks that I prefer. I'm still holding most of my most recent picks, and I have room for one more buy.J: Maybe you could give us an update on one of your current holdings.A: Fair enough. Irecommended United Rentals (URI) on 12/22  , after buying it myself a few days earlier.J: Isn't this one of your few picks where I agreed?A: Yes, I seem to remember that you said the pick was OK, but you did not own it yourself. I have held this one through a month or so of sideways movement, but now it's starting to pay off in a big way. We've seen an increase of roughly 20% in the last two weeks. That means it's about time for me to hop off this one (as fun of a ride as it's been).J: That certainly worked well. How are you doing overall?A: Not as well as the fussy guy and the dog, but that will change soon. I think I am Vince's favorite.FelixI will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the top overall vote getters from our (free) subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week.J: The list has some interesting changes. I see that Apple (AAPL) (which we own) is still in ""hold"" territory despite the major rally after its earnings report.F: My ratings came before the report. How about Amazon (AMZN)? That did not do so well. My approach is geared to the long term, usually more than one year.J: Fair enough. Do you have something new for us this week?F: No.J: What? I took a long weekend, but the rest of you were supposed to keep working. Only Holmes was on vacation.F: I worked, but there are no new choices. Patience is called for.J: Are you trying to get dropped from the weekly discussion?F: You would not dare! My performance leads the group. In addition, I provide updated information to my many fans. You should be giving me a raise. I am on the job while the dog is in Mexico.J: OK, we'll let the readers decide whether they still want your opinions.OscarMy pick for this week is the Defense sector, shown here by the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR). I liked this one back in early December too - but I got out before the downslide. Now that the price has had a few weeks to level out, I feel more comfortable getting back into this sector.For my next ""investment"" - I'll bet that Belichick can't put together a defense to stop the Falcons. But that really is another subject…Here are my ratings for the top reader interests. Keep the questions coming. My sectors are aggressive, but have less risk than Felix's picks. I avoid the bad news from random, single-stock moves.J: Interesting. Do you see evidence of that?O: I hear about it. People are very worried about something called ""tweets"" that seem to hit their stocks for no reason. Playing sectors reduces that risk.J: Interesting. The Tweeter-in-Chief has T-Wopped a few of the defense stocks, but most still believe in his support for higher defense spending.O: I only follow sports tweets, but I know which sectors have legs, and which will fail down the stretch.J: You really like the Falcons?O: My week's pay is on the line!Background on the Stock ExchangeEach week Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their   friends. Since they are all traders they love to discuss their   best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this   their ""Stock Exchange."" (Check it out for more background). Their methods are   excellent, as you know if you have been following the series.   Since the time frames and risk profiles differ, so do the stock   ideas. You get to be a fly on the wall from my report. I am the   only human present, and the only one using any fundamental   analysis.The result? Several expert ideas each week from traders, and a   brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor. The   models are named to make it easy to remember their trading   personalities. Each week features a different expert or   stock.QuestionsIf you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector, even   those we did not mention, just ask! Put questions in the   comments. Address them to a specific expert if you wish. Each has   a specialty. Who is your favorite? (You can choose me, although   my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the   models).ConclusionThe current trading environment is treacherous. Many frustrated traders are bailing out. Or have blown out. Political opinions about policy have proved to be a dangerous foundation for trading and investing.Our models provide a range of diverse ideas, all successful. Pick one that you like. Use it as a counterpoint for your own method. And keep control of position size and risk.The Stock Exchange does not have all the answers, but it     provides good ideas and a stimulus for your own trading.See alsoING: The Fundamentals Justify The Stock Price Momentumon seekingalpha.com"
4 Stocks That Are NOT Driven by the Trump Trade;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnyone who has been watching the markets for the past two months knows the far-reaching impact President Trump has had on stocks, bonds and currencies. Stock indices soared to all-time highs, bond prices dropped to 52-week lows and the value of the U.S. dollar climbed to highs last seen during the financial crisis.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf it seems like all sectors of the market were touched by the election, they were. President Trump's campaign promises, if enacted, have the ability to reach every corner of the stock market.His promised changes to the business tax code would impact every business. His promised changes to the personal income tax code would impact nearly every consumer. His promised infrastructure spending would increase inflation for the entire nation. His promised changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would impact nearly every employee. His promised relaxing of government regulations would affect nearly every employer. The list goes on and on.Looking at the market through this lens, there is not a company or stock that will not be impacted in some way by the Trump presidency. However, not all companies will be impacted to the same extent. Some companies are more vulnerable - for good or bad - to the promised policy changes than others.For instance, large banks and other financial institutions - likeGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - have been the unrivaled beneficiaries of a Trump presidency up to this point, because so many of the president's suggested changes benefit the banks' bottom lines. Rising inflation, lower corporate taxes and decreased regulation all benefit the banks.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryConversely, biotech companies - likeBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) - have struggled in the aftermath of the presidential election because the uncertainty swirling around what will eventually replace the ACA after the Republican-controlled Congress repeals it, coupled with the pointedTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and interview criticisms President Trump has issued regarding the high price of pharmaceuticals and other medical treatments, has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the healthcare industry.So which companies are less vulnerable to the potential policy changes and political whims of the president?While it's important to note that no company is immune from the potential threat of a targeted Twitter tirade from the president should it happen to draw his ire, there does seem to be a group of stocks that could bullishly go on its merry way during the first half of 2017 without having to look over its shoulder every morning to see if some new policy decision may threaten to derail its progress: the ""FANG"" stocks.The FANG stocks -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) [formerly Google, hence the ""G""]  - have been Wall Street darlings for the past few years. The shift consumers have made to living in an online world for everything from their social networking to shopping has pushed the valuation of these companies ever higher as traders bet on this trend continuing, regardless of what else happens in the economy.The FANG stocks took an initial hit after the results of the presidential election were announced in early November, as traders started taking profits on some of their more lucrative positions and rotating that money into the financial sector and other sectors that were poised to rally following President Trump's win. Nobody was doubting the strength of the FANG stocks - they just needed to free up cash to invest in even hotter stocks at the time.Once the initial rotation was complete, investors started coming back to the FANG stocks, which were then trading at much more favorable valuations, and started buying them up. After all, whatever happens to inflation, whatever happens with the tax code, whatever happens with health care, consumers are going to continue connecting with friends on Facebook, buying more stuff on Amazon, watching videos on Netflix and searching for information on Google.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonWe expect the FANG stocks and other tech stocks like them - stocks likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - to continue to do well during the next few months. We will certainly have to keep watching what the Trump administration does in the future (watching the net neutrality debate is going to be especially important for NFLX), but the traders on Wall Street aren't going to abandon their perpetual winners just yet.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings Dip;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago, analysts had to add numbers from dozens of retail companies to see how Christmas went. Now they just wait on the earnings fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which came out after the market closed on Feb. 2. Unfortunately, Christmas wasn't as rosy as hoped, and AMZN stock is down about 4% in Thursday's after-market trade as a result.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's final numbers were somewhat mixed. AMZN beat estimates on the earnings front, bringing in $1.54 per share - better than the consensus mark of $1.40, and the company's seventh straight quarter of profit.But Amazon was light on revenues, at $43.74 billion versus expectations of $44.84 billion. That still was a big jump from the $35.75 billion in revs last year, but not enough to please investors or experts. That caused AMZN stock to drop 4% within minutes.Bad news for most, though some - includingBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellier - were hoping to buy Amazon stock on the dip.CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized the variety of Amazon Prime servicesin his release, mentioning new offerings in gaming, storage, music and its Prime Now same-day shopping services. The company's studio launched hit shows likeThe Grand TourandMan in the High Castle, while the movieManchester by the Seadrew Oscar nominations but will debut on Prime within a few months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOur James Brumley was expecting fireworks after earnings, but most options traders were not making big bets either way. Most recently,I took some money off the table on Amazon, which as I noted was becoming a huge piece of my retirement savings.The biggest news from the analyst community was a super-bull call from Bill Miller, chairman of LMM Investments, claiming the value of AMZN stockcould double again in three years- making it more valuable thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). He also stating that Amazon now has higher gross margins thanWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT), which regularly sells nearly $120 billion of merchandise each quarter - not just at Christmas.The big turn in Amazon stock started when the company started breaking out numbers from Amazon Web Services, its cloud services unit,after the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the company has more than doubled, as the unit has been growing at 50% per year and proving it can book one-fourth of that revenue as operating profit, even when accounting for stock options given its top employees.In the third quarter, for instance, AWS earned $861 million on revenues of $3.231 billion. Yes, that's more thanthe whole company earned. Amazon still loses money regularly on its international expansion, where it now brings in nearly one-third of its revenue. For the fourth quarter, AWS brought in revenue of $3.54 billion, which was seen as disappointing.Why Buy AMZN Stock Now?It's the expectation of huge growth on a massive scale that have made Amazon the fourth-largest company by market capitalization in the U.S. It recently passedBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B), whose revenues regularly run 50% better than Amazon's Christmas expectations.Shares dropped 5.1% the day after the third quarter missed expectations oOct. 27, and you could have gotten Amazon for $719 per share two weeks later, on Nov. 14. But since then the stock has been on fire, and closed before earnings near $840 per share.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret WeaponBuyers keep coming for Amazon because every quarter, it seems to do something spectacular.This quarter, for instance, it delivered a new credit card offering 5% all Amazon purchases to Prime members. It announced a new air hub near Cincinnati,sinking sharesofUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS) andFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Its Alexa personal assistant dominated the Consumer Electronics Show,as our Brad Moon reported.All this has made AMZN stock a must-have for a growing number of small investors, who race in whenever the stock stumbles.Just like it did this afternoon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Amazon Earnings: AMZN EPS Climbs 54 Percent, Beats by 19 Cents;2/2/2017;"Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo)Retail giant Amazon.com (AMZN) reported fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings result after the market closed Thursday that showed the extent to which CEO Jeff Bezos can mash the profit accelerator whenever he wants. Though critics often complain about Amazon’s razor blade business model or the company’s aggressive spending, the stock has made investors rich over the past five years.With the success comes high expectations. Despite the strong 19-cent beat, Amazon shares are down some 3.5%. Investors who have waited for a solid buying opportunity now have their chance. Aside from the strong beat on the bottom line, Amazon not only offered solid fiscal 2017 guidance, the company’s dominant AWS cloud service showed enough growth momentum, suggesting higher profits in the quarters ahead. The smart thing to to now? Buy the stock and thank me in December.makeArticleAd();Let’s go through the numbers.For the three months that ended December, the Seattle-based e-commerce giant reported net income of $749 million, or $1.54 per share, compared with $482 million, or $1 per share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the Amazon to earn $1.36 per share. Fourth quarter revenue grew 22% year over year $43.7 billion from $35.7 billion a year ago, but missed consensus estimate of $44.7 billion. Amazon in December reported its strongest-ever holiday sales.Revenue from Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud services business, surged 47% year over year to $3.54 billion. The company also benefited from a 22% rise in North America revenue, reaching $26.2 billion and a 18% increase in international revenue of $13.9 billion.“Our Prime team’s customer obsession kept them busy in 2016,” said CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. “Prime members can now choose from over 50 million items with free two-day shipping — up 73% since 2015. Prime Video is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. Prime Now added 18 new cities, which means millions more members now get one and two hour delivery.”The company announced it will create more than 100,000 new full-time, full-benefit jobs in the U.S. over the next 18 months. It said these jobs will include positions across the country for all types of experience, education, and skill levels. In terms of guidance, Amazon expects first quarter revenue to be in the range of $33.25 billion and $35.75 billion, which assumed growth of 14% to 23% year over year. This compares to analysts estimates for revenue of $36 billion.Amazon stock closed during Thursday regular session at $840.18, up 0.94%. The stock has risen 12% year to date, besting the 2% rise in the S&P 500 Index. With shares falling on what was actually solid results, I expect Amazon stock to bounce back, reaching $1,000 per share, delivering 22% returns in the next 12 to 18 months."

Warning: Don’t Sell Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Short!;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), whose shares spiked 224% in 2016, has been lethal for short sellers. They lost a stunning$4.4 billion. And yes, it will probably still be bad for them to continue with their bearish bets on NVDA stock for the new year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNow short sellers are some of the world's best investors. If anything, they have to since the consequences of being wrong are so great! After all, a win for a short seller is if the stock goes to zero - which rarely happens. But as seen with Nvidia shares, the downside can be horrific.The irony is that short positions can provide tremendous fuel for price appreciation. Keep in mind that short sellers need to buy back shares to close out their positions.Something else to keep in mind: It's generally not a good strategy to take a short position merely because the valuation is excessive. There are many examples of companies - likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) in the 1980s and 1990s, orAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) during the past decade - that have sustained long bull runs. Wall Street is more than willing to place premiums on firms that can grow fast and with consistency.As for NVDA stock, the valuation is definitely pricey. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is roughly at 42! By comparison,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 12.5 andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) sports a multiple of 11.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatBut, of course, NVDA is growing at breakneck speed. So over time the multiples will normalize as the earnings continue to build up. For example, in the latest quarter, Nvidia reporteda sizzling 54% spike in revenuesto $2 billion and GAAP earnings came to 83 cents a share, up 89%.The thing to keep in mind is that Nvidia is positioned nicely to benefit from various megatrends, which should provide lots of room for growth. The company's deep experience with graphics processing units (GPUs), which allow for intensive computations, is becoming the elixir for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars and gaming. All these markets are massive and on the verge of major changes.For example, according to a recentpresentationfrom Nvidia, the market opportunity for autos alone is at least $10 billion. And the company may be in the best position to benefit. The company has built a full platform for so-called AI car computing - called Nvidia Drive PX 2 - that uses high-performance chips and software to detect surroundings as well as determine optimal routes. Actually, there are over80 automakers that use the system, includingTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).At the core of all of Nvidia's advantages in various large markets is the company's focus on AI. For the most part, GPUs have proven adept at this type of advanced computing, which allow for trillions of deep learning transactions per second. The result is that a system can quickly adapt and learn. So, this means a self-driving car will know where to turn or stop.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weapon;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is often compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which isn't always accurate. Most notably, Alibaba doesn't hold inventory like its larger U.S. peer, and it doesn't have AMZN's massive distribution capabilities. But, there is one notable similarity that doesn't seem priced into BABA stock at the moment:makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA large, fast-growing cloud computing offering.Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been a major factor in the rise of AMZN stock from less than $200 to more than $800 over the past five years.Alibaba Cloud is still much smaller, but its growth profile looks much like that of AWS back in 2011-12. That explosive growth - and the ability to be a legitimate competitor to Amazon.com andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) - has the potential to drive significant additional upside in BABA stock.The Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA StockSo far, the cloud business hasn't done much for Alibaba's revenue, or BABA stock, for that matter. BABA still trades around $100, basically the same levels at which it went public in late 2014.Through the first nine months of fiscal 2016, cloud has generated just 3.3% of total revenue. Over the past four quarters, Alibaba's cloud sales total just $765 million - likely less than 6% of what AWS will create in calendar 2016. And at the moment, Alibaba's cloud business actually is a drag on BABA earnings. The business has lost $92 million in EBITA (not EBITDA; BABA uses EBITA for segment income) over the past four quarters.3 BRICS Buys That Play Banking, Buying and ... Beef?But the gap to Amazon and the losses in the business have more to do with Alibaba's relatively late start than with a lack of demand. Cloud revenue growth has been impressive, increasing 130% through the first nine months of fiscal 2016, and 115% in the December quarter, despite a pricing cut.That follows a 138% increase in cloud sales in fiscal 2016. Most impressively, the number of customers nearly doubled year-over-year in Q3, and BABA added 114,000 new customers in the December quarter alone.As for profitability, Alibaba isn't worried, yet, with management saying on the Q3 conference call it was spending to gain market share. Profitability will come, but for now, Alibaba is looking to cement its dominance of the lucrative Chinese market.Losses now are OK - AWS lost money until recently - because those new customers will provide high-margin recurring revenue going forward, possibly for decades.The Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA Stock Going ForwardThe good news for BABA stock is that it looks like the cloud business is nearing an inflection point. Losses are narrowing, but still represent a drag on overall earnings for BABA. Over the past 12 months, cloud has actually had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.03. That will change shortly, as Alibaba has said that the business will hit a profit around 1 million users, a milestone almost certain to be hit in 2017.The question is what happens after that. If Alibaba's growth looks anything like Amazon's going forward, it should be very positive for BABA stock.AMZN didn't break out cloud revenue until 2015; it appears that the business generated about $1 billion in sales in 2011 and $2 billion in 2012. That then grew to almost $4 billion in 2013, $5.6 billion in 2014, and $7.9 billion in 2015. 2016 growth to date suggests a figure over $12 billion in 2016. AWS is now estimated by analysts to be worth (on its own) about $150-$160 billion.Can Alibaba grow its cloud business to the same extent? Goldman Sachs analysts argued it could,projecting a valuefor Alibaba Cloud of $42 billion by 2019, based on $5 billion in sales. That growth alone would add almost 20% to the value of BABA stock over the next few years and it's not as outlandish as it seems.The Future Looks Bright for BABA StockGrowth rates have been over 100%, yet cloud computing is still relatively unknown in China. On the Q3 conference call, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang estimated that, even assuming pricing discounts to lure customers using hard drives, the addressable market for cloud in China would be $30 billion. And in November, Alibaba added new data centers in four locations worldwide: Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai and Germany.The concern might be whether a Chinese company will be able to compete internationally with Amazon and Microsoft. U.S. companies might prefer domestic providers, and elsewhere there could be worries about security.But, the reverse of that argument is that Alibaba should have a huge advantage in marketing to Chinese consumers, as those customers might be similarly unwilling to use American companies for their cloud services. Even with BABA now worth approximately $250 billion, the $30 billion Chinese market is more than enough to provide a material catalyst.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAWS profit margins already arenearing 25%despite its own spending in that business. Assuming Alibaba can get half of the Chinese market at 30% margins, the cloud segment could contribute as much as $1.50 per share in EPS annually, enough to add $30 billion-$40 billion in market value. Any international success would simply add to that value.Until now, the business hasn't been a focus of BABA stock investors, but that seems likely to change. When the company hits the 1 million mark and turns cloud profitable in 2017, coverage of the business should likely increase. And, further awareness of that driver seems equally likely to drive upside for BABA stock. Investors should consider getting long in Alibaba stock before the rest of the market figures that out.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruarySears Holdings Corp (SHLD): A Great American Tragedy Nears Its EndThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weaponappeared first onInvestorPlace."
3 BRICS Buys That Play Banking, Buying and … Beef?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEmerging markets like the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - haven't exactly been an investing friend in recent years. Before the Great Recession, EMs were one of the best places to find a hefty dose of capital gains. As these nations grew and expanded, so did their stocks. Broad-based funds like theiShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF(NYSE:EEM) weretheplace to find great long-term gains.makeArticleAd();Source:Rodrigo Soldon Via FlickrThen the bottom dropped out.Emerging markets stocks spent the last few years just scraping by. Some analysts question whether you need them anymore for growth - especially some of the more developed BRICS countries.But a funny thing happened. Emerging markets have come back and have posted their beststart to a year since 2012. The primary driver has been the reflation trade in the United States - given many of these nation's ties to commodities, developing markets have often done very well in periods of inflation.Add that to other positives - young workforces, massive consumer potential and rising GDPs - emerging markets (even the BRICS) are once again the place to be.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsToday, we'll look at three BRICS stocks to buy today.BRICS Stocks to Buy: BRF SA (BRFS)When you think beef, odds are you think Texas. But instead of the Lone Star state, you should be thinking about … Brazil.Brazil is the world's largest exporter of beef and poultry. AndBRF SA (ADR)(NYSE:BRFS) just happens to take the crown when it comes to that exporting. The former Brasil Foods ships its meat to more than 150 different countries - both emerging and developed - around the world.BRF SA is a (pardon the pun) prime example of how country of origin can be meaningless. The bulk of BRFS' revenues are generated outside of Brazil's borders.Its dominant position as the world's largest exporter of chicken and beef is reason alone to consider the stock. However, the firm has expanded heavily in prepackage foods in recent years. These higher-margin goods have allowed BRF SA to overcome some of the weakness in the global poultry market.The company also is the biggest producer of halal meat in the world - a growing demand, and higher margins help here too.All told, BRF SA has great financials including low debt leverage and healthy cash positions. Still, BRFS is treated like a castaway, paying just 6 times forward earnings despite a nearly 3% dividend yield to boot.BRICS Stocks to Buy: HDFC Bank (HDB)India has a population of 1.25 billion (at least as of 2013), and it's one of the best emerging markets to own for rising consumerism.While that means a boon for consumer stocks, it also means big things for financial services. India features one of thelargest un- and underbanked populations in the entire world. AndHDFC Bank Limited (ADR)(NYSE:HDB) happens to be the superstar of this banking-starved BRICS market.HDB is India's second largest private lender. That position has suited it well over the years as it has managed to produce a staggering 29% annual average growth over nearly two decades. And while performing loans helped, the real story is reaching out and getting more customers.As corporate lending has stalled, HBFC has plowed heavily into personal and retail banking and lending. Even better: HBFC is theleading credit card issuer in India. While net interest margins aren't as large down on the retail side, there is tremendous volume and potential to pick up more down the road. New initiatives such as mobile and text message banking are designed to add these underbanked customers to its mix.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe opportunity for financial services across numerous emerging markets is huge. HBFC is one of the best BRICS stocks to buy to play the trend.BRICS Stocks to Buy: Alibaba (BABA)China is the king of emerging markets. While its growth isn't as breakneck as it used to be, and while other EMs are growing more quickly, China still has enormous potential not just because of its own populace, but the potential for international expansion by its larger firms.Thus, if you were to buy and hold just one Chinese stock, it would have to beAlibaba Group Holdings Ltd(NYSE:BABA).Heck, it might even be the best tech stock acrossallmarkets.InvestorPlace'sJeff Reevespoints out at MarketWatchthat:""China's internet population just surpassed 730 million after a roughly 6% growth rate last year. That number is more than the entire population of the U.S., Russia, Japan and Germany combined.""What's more: This number still is growing. We're only about halfway regarding China's total population.As the nation's leading e-commerce site, BABA is at the forefront to profit from the digital revolution in China. Perhaps more importantly, it does so very profitably. See, Alibaba is unlike rivalAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in that it doesn't sell products from its own warehouses and holds the inventory. Alibaba only acts as a middleman for other retailers. That means higher margins per transaction.And as BABA continues to expand into non-core, but still significant opportunities - cloud computing, logistics, financial services - its fortunes should grow as well.Alibaba stock trades at 23 times forward earnings, so it's hardly cheap. But this BRICS stock represents perhaps the world's best e-commerce firm in the world's largest emerging market. That premium is worth it.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 BRICS Buys That Play Banking, Buying and … Beef?appeared first onInvestorPlace."
3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe're still seeing a lot of weakness in the market as the earnings season is failing to add the spark that most investors were hoping for. While the aggregate bullish effect of the season hasn't been felt, there have been some stocks that are seeing opportunities to extend themselves higher likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). On the other hand,Cincinnati Financial Corporation(NASDAQ:CINF) has found itself in a must-win situation ahead of next week's earnings results as the company's stock is barely hanging on to its long-term bullish trend.makeArticleAd();Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Amazon heads into the earnings confessional this afternoon as the stock sits near its highs around $850 technically teasing those looking at taking a position ahead of the numbers.The charts indicate that AMZN shares have become less overbought over the last week as the stock took a move towards its 20-day moving average. This move is very familiar to those of us that watch Amazon as it is a carbon copy of the pre-earnings activity last quarter.Today's AMZN chart is somewhat different and more supportive of the bulls as the stock is now shifting into an intermediate-term bull trend with the 50-day trendline crossing back over the 100-day. Our historical testing shows that Amazon stock is 63% more likely to outperform the at-any-time returns for the two months following this crossover.Volume on AMZN has dropped a little over the last week as we've seen traders back away ahead of the earnings. Call options on the stock have dropped in premium, suggesting that the options traders aren't expecting Amazon stock to knock the cover off of the ball this afternoon.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThis adds up to breakout potential for the stock on an in-line report. The potential fly in the ointment would be the fact that MSFT is growing their Azure line of business. Watch for this to take a little away from the magic that has been AWS, Amazon's real driving force. Outside of that, the charts suggest a breakout on the way for AMZN.Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF)Last month, Cincinnati Financial shares took a hit on the exposure to the tragedy in Gatlinburg. Since then, CINF shares have spent their time consolidating and trying to place a tradable bottom, but there's a hanging issue.As of this week, all but the 200-day moving average have transitioned into a short- to intermediate-term bearish pattern. This means that Cincinnati Financial stock is likely to start feeling more pressure from the sellers again as overhead pressure builds.CINF chart watchers remember the significance of the $70-level last October. The shares took a decline to this level after an earnings report that failed to impress. Now, Cincinnati Financial prepares to report its quarterly results next Wednesday as the stock sits on this same critical chart support level. This makes the earnings announcement a ""must win"" for CINF.The 20-month moving average sits at $66.50, which is the line in the sand that long-term investors should be watching. A move to or below this level is going to spark additional selling as this stock has been one of the better performers in its peer group.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Again we get to cover Microsoft this week as the stock appears to be giving those patient traders an opportunity.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonMSFT shares rallied after a positive earnings announcement and took the shares to new all-time highs. After ringing that bell, the profiteers stepped in to lock in gains resulting in a near 5% drop in the Microsoft stock price.Technically, MSFT stock is now setting up for a nice short-term buying opportunity as it has worked off a technically overbought indication at the same time that it is nearing the 50-day moving average at $62.40.Since breaking above the 50-day in October, Microsoft stock has found significant buying interest on each test of the widely watched trendline. The last test, in December, resulted in an 8% rally over an 11-trading day period.Those looking to hold off and be patient can look for MSFT stock to head to the $60.50, which is the next site of trendline support at the 100-day. For now, our money is on a more shallow pullback to the 50-day holding as the more likely technical scenario to play out on Microsoft.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."
Of Groundhogs, Earnings and Jobless Claims;2/2/2017;"Thursday, February 2, 2017makeArticleAd();So Punxsutawney Phil, Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, has emerged from his hole and seen his shadow this morning, indicating 6 more weeks of winter. A quick glance at the calendar would show that mid-March is indeed times for winter to subside - to say nothing of all the spotlights cast upon the poor rodent this morning: how can Phil NOT see his shadow?Setting aside whatever importance this annual event might hold in the hearts and minds of individuals, there is some data out this morning serious market participants are paying close attention to: Initial Jobless Claims and continuing Q4 earnings results. We also see numbers out after the bell today from AmazonAMZN, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock with Zacks Style Score of C, which is expected to make $1.40 per share for its Q4 earnings.Initial Jobless ClaimsThe new print for the weekly jobless claims numbers fell 14K to 246K, again below the historically low and psychologically satisfying 250K level. Continuing claims also fell, though not as drastically: 2.10 million from the previous week went down to 2.064 million. Both reads indicate continued strength in the U.S. labor force.Tomorrow's Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) non-farm payroll report will be released before the bell, following yesterday's extraordinary 246K new private sector jobs gains, according to payroll giant ADPADP. Expectations from the BLS report are much lower - roughly 174K or so - but still within the narrative of strength in U.S. labor. We don't anticipate a lower number - it will more likely be above the current consensus, if the ADP report is to be believed - although many analysts expect to see the unemployment rate steady at 4.7%.Q4 EarningsAhead of the bell today, CME GroupCMEperformed decently on the bottom line while beating top-line estimates with $913 million in total quarterly sales. This represents 12% revenue growth year over year. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company had a Zacks Style Score of F ahead of the report; we will look for analyst adjustments going forward.International PaperIPposted a 3-cent beat for its Q4 earnings totals: 73 cents per share from the 70 cents expected. This is still down double-digits from year-ago results.

Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade Again;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAyuuugenarrative inBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) and other financials has lost a bit of steam in recent days. Nevertheless and as you'll soon see, that's a very good thing for shares … and even better if you're willing to trade BAC stock.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrToday, I have an idea for some financial engineering that won't break the bank.Following a massive rally spurred by President Trump-inspired idealism on everything from deregulation to a corporate tax boon to beneficial re-inflation conditions, BAC stock has gone nowhereveryfast over the past few weeks.Investors are now busy backtracking on a bit of the market's notorious perfect pricing mechanism. That has put a lid on BofA. A newer, bearish narrative of protectionist policies and potential trade wars have been stealing the spotlight in recent days since the new administration took the reins.At the end of the day, market narratives happen all the time. It's the gray in-between area where history is eventually written.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryMaybe Goldman Sachs knows what tomorrow, next week or the next four years look like, but it's good to have an investment backstop - like options on BAC stock - rather than rely too aggressively on the""Trump put.""BAC Stock ChartClick to EnlargeBank of America hasremoved the downside risksassociated with an extremely overbought condition. What's more, the price action also indicates a breakout and rally are imminent.Admittedly, our prior technical case of BAC - prone to a corrective move into the $20-$21 area - proved too ambitious with a low of $21.77 for the period. But as both price and time are important factors in determining a correction; some good work has been provided in Bank of America.Subsequent price movement in BAC stock has consolidated brisk gains of around 35% to establish a neutral, but constructive seven- to eight-week flat base pattern. So while the depth of BofA's correction came up short of our forecast, the duration spent and firmness of the bid suggests the upside outweighs the downside risks at this juncture.Now, for the trade.How to Trade BAC Stock HereGiven the continued supportive dynamics working hard to make BofA great again, and the removal of earnings risk, I like a modified collar combination right now.Sell an Apr $25 call and buy the Apr $22/$20 bear put spread for $23.10, as of BAC's current price of $23.02. A bullish investor maintains about 8.5% of upside into April expiration with the sold $25 call capping profits at $1.90 per spread.The max gain on BAC is unadjusted and on an expiration basis, with the potential for larger gains by rolling the position beyond the initial hedge.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EOn the flipside, if BAC stock fails to move higher and declines in price, the bear put spread portion of the combo affords the trader a partial but very effective hedge from $20-$22.Under ideal conditions, the spread works to buffer the loss in share price, dollar-for-dollar. But even during a less agreeable price swing lower, this modified collar should greatly curtail downside risk on BAC stock - and in our view trumps other alternatives quite nicely.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Is Amazon Threatened by the Proposed Tax Bill in Arkansas?;2/2/2017;"Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNmight have to drop one of its competitive strategies against brick-and-mortar stores in Arkansas if a proposal advanced by an Arkansas Senate panel on Wednesday is accepted.Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 51.19% compared with the industry's gain of 45.07%.The Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee proposed that out-of-state companies that do not have any physical presence in Arkansas should collect sales tax if they exceed $100,000 worth sales or 200 separate sales transactions. The proposal will go before the full Senate on Thursday.Taking Advantage of an Old Court RulingAmazon has been taking advantage of a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that bars states from forcing out-of-state sellers lacking a physical presence to collect tax.Amazon even terminated contracts with its Arkansas-based affiliates back in Jul 2011 to avoid paying sales taxes from this state.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteWhat's Behind the Move?Per The National Conference of State Legislatures, the state had to forego more than $23 billion in tax revenues from online and catalog sales in 2012.Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson believes that the step could generate $32 million to $100 million of additional revenues. The state will enact a deeper income tax cut before the 2019 session.To ConcludeThe court ruling dates back to the pre-online shopping era. We believe that it lacks significance today when companies can sell at a place without having a physical presence.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA CorporationNVDA, Linear Technology CorporationLLTCand Intersil CorporationISIL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bloom is off the rose for the ""Trump rally,"" and Wall Street is finally taking the new administration at its word as U.S. stock futures are headed broadly lower this morning. A string of geopolitical issues from President Donald Trump has traders worried, including potentialnew sanctions on Iran, the threat ofsending troops to Mexicoand a heated exchange with the Australian prime minister.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.23%,S&P 500futures are off 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.23%.On the options front, call activity rebounded amid a string of strong quarterly reports from the tech sector. Overall, about 16.5 million calls and 14.2 million puts crossed the tape yesterday. On the CBOE, however, put activity remained a potent driver, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arriving at 0.71 and the 10-day moving average hitting another three-month high of 0.69.As for Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call options chased yesterday's post-earnings rally as the company offered up a much-needed win. Elsewhere,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) also drew heavy call volume ahead of last night's quarterly report andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) extended its blistering 12-month rally to more than 430% on the heels of another blowout quarter.Apple Inc. (AAPL)After posting three straight quarters of declining revenue and faltering earnings, Apple finally hit it big. For the holiday quarter, Apple said it earned $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion, easily besting expectations for $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAccording to CEO Tim Cook, the results were ""Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""But while AAPL options traders attempted to chase the rally with calls, Wednesday's post-earnings call volume (as a percentage of total volume) still came in light. Total volume reached a whopping 3.34 million contracts yesterday, with calls accounting for a below average 61% of the day's take. Still, 3.34 million contracts is quite impressive, and adds up to quite a lot of call activity on AAPL stock.On the other hand, some traders appear to be fading the rally already, as open interest at the 3 Feb $128 and $127 strikes surged to more than 10,000 contracts each. AAPL is trading slightly lower in premarket action this morning, and broad market headwinds could place these puts in the money by weeks end.Facebook Inc (FB)Facebook stepped into the earnings limelight after the close last night to post itsseventh-straight earnings beat. The company said sales surged 53% to $8.83 billion, with earnings arriving at $1.41 per share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.52 billion. Additionally, daily active users (DAUs) rose 18% to 1.23 billion, mobile DAUs were up 23% at 1.15 billion and mobile ad revenue came in at 84% of all advertising revenue.FB stock options traders were quite bullish heading into the report, with calls accounting for 64% of the nearly 1.6 million contracts traded. FB is trading roughly 0.6% higher this morning, with the shares set to open in record high territory north of $135.Currently, there are 12,700 calls open at the $135 strike in the 3 Feb series, with another 12,000 at $137 and 12,700 at the $140 strike. If buying pressure can overcome broad market headwinds, FB could make a run at $137, but $140 may be unreachable until the end of next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD solidified its position in the semiconductor hot seat yesterday when the company blew past Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations.For the quarter, AMD narrowed its loss to a penny per share on revenue of $1.11 billion, compared to expectations for a loss of two cents per share on $1.07 billion in sales.What's more, AMD said its Ryzen should hit shelves by March and that the much-anticipated graphics processor should boost revenue by 18%.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EAMD options traders were all over call contracts yesterday, with these typically bullish best making up 66% of the 712,000 contracts traded - well above average for AMD. As of yesterday's close, the stock is trading north of all but the most bullish of heavy call OI strikes in the Feb. series, with 1,400 contracts at $12.50 and 1,100 at $13.However, there is a bit of profit taking going on this morning, with AMD pulling back by about 1.5% amid broad market selling pressure. Profit taking might not be a bad idea at the moment, as a consolidation period is warranted after yesterday's 16% surge.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest negatives surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company's sky-high price-to-earnings ratio. According to Google Finance, AMZN stock currently trades at an eye-popping 191 times its trailing earnings of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon has at least given investors the courtesy of growing profits to try to somewhat justify the lofty valuation. That 191x is on trailing 12-month earnings of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earned $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translates into 52 cents per share.It's obvious Amazon stock investors care about growth, not valuation. AMZN's sky-high P/E has been in place for years, and will likely continue for some time.And that's actually OK. Here are two important reasons why:Amazon Revenue GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stories in today's market.When the company releases 2016's final numbers Thursday, Feb. 2, analysts expect Amazon to post revenue of $137 billion. That's an improvement of more than 25% versus 2015's top line - a difficult feat when you're talking about 12-digit sales. And Amazon's $107 billion in revenue last year was 20% better than 2014.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWe live in a world in whichS&P 500constituents are doing well if they're posting just single-digit increases on the top line. You can blame this at least partly on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weighing down American multinationals. But the fact remains that meaningful growth is a scarce quality in today's stock market - especially among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easy way for investors to get access to big growth with relatively little risk.And Amazon is hardly running out of fuel. The company has only begun to expand into grocery and apparel - two huge categories. Trillions of dollars are spent worldwide each year at physical stores. That's not to mention the other gains Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Services cloud offerings and other newer initiatives.Analysts predict Amazon's revenue will increase another 22% in 2017, hitting $168 billion. So again - the growth story is still well intact.But it's not all about growth. Many AMZN stock bulls argue that we're just looking at earnings the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?One thing that separates Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos from many other executives is his ability to look at the really,reallylong-term. He's also willing to spend billions of dollars on ideas, and is OK with hitting a few duds if it means spawning great new ideas.Remember the company's smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a website called Askville? I'm guessing you might remember the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on its smartphone alone.This kind of risk taking is an inherent part of Amazon's culture. It's the line of thinking that prodded the company to introduce some of its biggest winners to date, like cloud services, Prime shipping and the Kindle.Thus, many investors look at AMZN stock in a different way. They look at the company's operating profit, then they add back its substantial research and development costs to get a ""truer"" sense of profitability.Admittedly, that changes the picture dramatically.Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL)In its most recent quarter, Amazon produced net income of $252 million, which across 485 million diluted shares became diluted earnings of 52 cents per share. At the time, AMZN was trading at $822 per share. If we annualize that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterly earnings fluctuate - this is just for an example), we're looking at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also reported operating profits of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a significant expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annualize that, then divide the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let's take the actual numbers. Amazon currently trades for 190 times trailing 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and posted operating profits of more than $4 billion. That comes to $40.19 per share combined, and puts AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That's a lot of creative accounting, so take that with a spoonful of salt. But it's an interesting argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continues to be one of the best growth stories in today's market. As long as that continues, investors aren't going to care about the headline P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock has doubled several times over despite it.Amazon is solidly profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as large as investors typically would like. But those earnings are being reinvested back in the business - which is what a high-growth company like Amazon should be doing anyway.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Domino's (DPZ) Expands Ordering Facilities on Messenger;2/2/2017;"One of the world leaders in pizza delivery and digital ordering platforms,Domino's Pizza, Inc.DPZ, is further expanding its digital ordering capabilities on Facebook Inc.'sFBMessenger.makeArticleAd();Until now, customers with a Pizza Profile were restricted to placing their most recent order or Easy Order via Facebook Messenger. Domino's went one step ahead by becoming the first national pizza chain to have full ordering capabilities on Messenger. Customers can now place any order for any menu item on the Messenger. Now, they won't need any Pizza Profile and can place orders through the company's enhanced ordering assistant bot - Dom.The enhancement comes just in time for one of the company's busiest day of the year - Football's final Sunday. Domino's expects sales to be five times more than on a typical Sunday. Thus, making ordering more convenient for customers could further add to the sales.The digital wave has hit the U.S. fast casual restaurant sector. Hence, an increasing number of restaurants are implementing technology to enhance guest experience. Similarly, Domino's is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. The company keeps on adding various ordering apps and platforms to its digital capabilities.In fact, Domino's lineup of AnyWare ordering capabilities currently has a total of 10 platforms that include Alphabet, Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle Home, Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNEcho, and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text.Notably, digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. This is one of the reasons Domino's shares have widely outperformed the broader Zacks categorizedRetail-Restaurantsindustry over the past year. While the stock gained 50.3%, the broader industry declined 3.6% in the same time period.Although the company's initiatives such as implementation of technology and re-imaging of restaurants offer long-term advantages, the costs related to them are expected to continue dampening margins in the near term. Further, the company's wide international presence makes it highly vulnerable to foreign exchange headwinds, while a soft industry backdrop is putting pressure on the top line.Nevertheless, going forward, the extended ways to order a pizza are poised to keep Domino's in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Also, this should help in improving the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's sales trends and enhance its competitive positioning.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM): The Best Developing Nations ETF;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen factoring in single-country and fixed-income offerings, there are over 200 emerging markets exchange-traded products trading in the U.S. That represents a significant portion of the overall U.S. exchange-traded products market.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Diversified emerging markets exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or ETFs exposed to a sizable group of developing economies, are usually the stopping point for many investors looking for emerging markets exposure. Popular alternatives in this ETF genre include theVanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF(NYSEARCA:VWO) and theiShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF(NYSEARCA:EEM).Seasoned investors know that some developing economies are credible dividend destinations and that the theme of emerging markets dividends is easily accessible via ETFs. Additionally, experienced investors know that dividend strategies can be used as complements or even alternatives totraditional emerging markets ETFs.Enter theWisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund(NYSEARCA:DEM) as one of the best emerging markets ETFs on the market. In fact, in the right market environments, a case can be made that DEM is the best emerging markets ETF, dividends or otherwise.While these are superficial metrics, many investors embrace ETFs that they perceive to be large and old. DEM accommodates on those fronts as an assets under management tally of nearly $1.6 billion makes it the largest emerging-markets dividend ETF and the fund is just a few months shy of its tenth birthday.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsOver the past year, DEM is up 39%, a showing that easily tops the 29% returned by theMSCI Emerging Markets Indexover that span. Of course, yield is a big reason why some might argue in favor of DEM as the best emerging markets ETF. DEM's underlying index, the WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Index, has adividend yield of 5.4%, making the trailing 12-month yield on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index seem piddly by comparison.DEM's index ""is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of the highest dividend yielding stocks selected from the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Dividend Index,"" according to WisdomTree. The more than 300 stocks found in this emerging markets ETF are then weighted by dividends paid rather than by market value, the methodology used by many old guard emerging markets funds.A significant driver of DEM's yield and recent outperformance of rival emerging markets funds is Russia. DEM has one of the largest Russia allocations of any emerging markets ETF at 17.4%. That compares to 4.2% in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. As was noted earlier, DEM can be a best emerging markets ETF in the right environment and usually that environment is one whereRussian equities are flourishingas they are now.""Russian companies pay some of the highest dividends in the emerging market world; Russian stocks are expected to pay a 4.9% dividend yield in 2017 on thier 2016 earnings, 2-4 percentage points more than their peers - and the companies that do pay well are amongst Russian portfolio investors' favourites,"" according toIntelliNews.DEM's Russia exposure, not surprisingly, can be a double-edged sword. Over the past three years, a period that saw Russian stocks struggle for a good part of that time, DEM lagged major emerging markets benchmarks while being slightly more volatile.Still, DEM asserts its status as a best emerging markets ETF when looking at the total picture. Since coming to market in July 2007, is up 12.1%. That doesn't sound like much, but it is better than the negative returns generated by the largest, diversified emerging markets ETFs. Additionally, DEM has been 670 basis points less volatile than the MSCI Emerging Markets Index since inception. Those data points indicate that DEM's 0.63% annual fee, high by ETF standards, is actually worth it.Why Amazon.com, Inc.

Top Online Retail Stocks to Buy in 2017;2/1/2017;"Even after two decades of torrid growth, the rise of   e-commerce is still in its early innings. Online sales comprise   less than 10% of retail sales, with research firm eMarketer   estimating that retail e-commerce sales will increase to more   than $4 trillion in 2020, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2015.   With millions more people gaining access to the Internet every   year, e-commerce appears set to grow at a rapid pace for at least   another decade, and likely much longer. Read on to see whyAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andShopify(NYSE: SHOP) stand to benefit from this megatrend perhaps more   than any other companies.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();The titanNo discussion of online retail can take place without   mentioning the mighty Amazon.com. The company dominates   e-commerce -- and, increasingly -- retail as a whole.Amazon's awe inspiring rise has come at the expense of many   traditional brick and mortar retailers, as the online juggernaut   has left retail carnage in its wake. In fact, with Amazon's stock   up more than 20 times in value over the past decade -- and many   of its major rivalsdown sharplyduring that time -- Amazon was worth more than eight of the   largest retailers combined by the end of 2016.The Extraordinary Size of Amazon in One Chart:https://t.co/c5dj1s8aa6$AMZNpic.twitter.com/u9FCK3YXh3- Visual Capitalist (@VisualCap)December 30, 2016With its unmatched value proposition -- built on low prices,     a wide selection of goods, inexpensive shipping, and excellent     customer service -- Amazon should only continue to gobble up     retail market share in the years ahead. As such, investors who     buy shares today should be well rewarded, just as those who've     invested in Amazon at any time in its history -- and held their     shares -- have been rewarded to date.Image source: Shopify.The challengerOne of the rare companies that's been able to withstand   Amazon's onslaught is multi-channel commerce platform, Shopify.   In fact, after originally competing with Shopify, Amazon decided   to close down its Webstore service and recommended that its   merchants migrate to Shopify's platform. Since that time, Shopify   has grown at a torrid pace, with the number of merchants using   its platform rising to more than 325,000 in the third quarter, up   from 200,000 in the prior year period.Co-founder and CEO Tobi Lutke has positioned the company as an   invaluable provider of cloud-based commerce solutions to small-   and medium-sized businesses, along with a growing number of   larger enterprises such asTesla MotorsandProcter & Gamble. Shopify helps users sell their goods across multiple channels,   including online retail marketplaces such as Amazon.com andeBay, social media giants such asFacebookand Pinterest, and standalone websites and brick-and-mortar   stores. In addition, Shopify provides crucial back-office   services such as sales tracking, payment processing, and   inventory management. It's a comprehensive commerce platform   that, along with a growing list of integrated third-party apps,   provides users pretty much everything they need to run their   business.""Shopify is exactly this: the only platform you need to build   your empire,"" reads aletterfrom Lutke on Shopify's investor-relations website. ""Shopify is   the first thing our merchants log into in the morning and the   last thing they log out of in the evening. It's at the heart of   their business -- a responsibility that we take very   seriously.""Moreover, Shopify has only just begun to fulfill its massive   growth potential.

Why Amazon’s Move Toward Autonomous Vehicles Could Be Key to Its Bottom Line;2/1/2017;"E-commerce giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) was recently granted a patent that signals its   potential move into self-driving vehicles. The patent indicates   that Amazon is trying to build a technology whereby vehicles can   communicate with each other while approaching a road with a   reversible lane.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The abstract of the patent says:A roadway management system can generate lane configurations     for a roadway or a portion of the roadway. The roadway     management system can determine the direction of travel for     lanes in a roadway and direct autonomous automobiles to enter     the roadway in a particular lane.This patent is an indication that the company could be working   on autonomous vehicle technology. Something that lends support to   this idea is that Amazon's technical advisor for Prime Air -- Jim   Curlander -- is one of the inventors of the roadway management   patent.Curlander is currently working on developing the technology to   deliver Amazon orders via drones in 30 minutes or less. This   means that he is already involved in the process of automating   deliveries, and autonomous trucks are the next logical step.What does the patent mean for Amazon?With Amazon's technology, autonomous vehicles will be able to   safely plan their routes and better navigate the correct lane on   a reversible road in advance. The patent also points toward the   development of a roadway management system wherein vehicles can   communicate with each other and coordinate their movements.These developments could have widespread ramifications for the   company in two ways. First, Amazon will be able to reduce its   shipping expenses as delivery trucks will spend less time in   traffic after calculating the best route in advance. This will   lead to lower fuel costs and faster transit times. Second, as   Amazon is going to both own and operate this technology, the   company can license it to other automakers for a fee.The first point, however, is currently of greater importance   for Amazon since it would allow the company to bring down   ballooning shipping costs.Delivery costs going through the roofAmazon's outbound shipping costs have grown quickly in recent   years, far outpacinggrowth in the company's shipping revenue.Data source: Statista. Chart by author.These shipping costs will rise once again for 2016. Worldwide   shipping costs in the first nine months of 2016 increased 40%   from the prior-year period to $10.5 billion. Amazon was expected   to add at least another $3.9 billion in shipping costs during the   fourth quarter, giving us a total spend for 2016 of $14.4   billion.The company's unwavering focus on reducing shipping times for   customers -- especially Prime members -- is largely responsible.   Costs could rise further in the future as the company rolls out   its one-to-two hour deliveries to more locations. As a   result, Amazon is working toward the development of autonomous   delivery technology like drones and self-driving trucks to reduce   both personnel and fuel costs.Why self-driving trucks are a natural progression for     AmazonAmazon has not provided specific details for how it plans to   use the patent yet, but recent developments point toward the   eventual reality that Amazon will roll out self-driving trucks at   some point in the future.In Dec. 2015, Amazon purchased ""thousands"" of truck trailers   in order to move goods between warehouses. Then, in Jan. 2016,   the company acquired a 100% stake in package delivery company   Colis Privé in order to expand its last-mile delivery   capabilities. It appears Amazon is gradually building a delivery   system that it personally owns, so it may have greater control   over the movement of goods.And according to Business Insider, Amazon is also expected to   launch an app this summer that will match truckers with shippers,   creating an Uber-like marketplace for transportation and   delivery. This move will allow Amazon to eliminate a 15%   brokerage fee that needs to be paid to the middlemen as it can   get in touch directly with trucking companies. The app can also   improve the efficiency of transportation as it is expected to   provide driving directions and truck stop recommendations by   planning the route and estimated time in advance.These moves seem to complement the broad strategy of exerting   more control over the supply infrastructure as Amazon reduces   costs wherever possible, boosting profitability and expediting   the delivery process at the same time.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Cracks All-Time Highs With a Big Q4 Beat;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) piled on to its outstanding 2017 after Wednesday's bell, putting out a Street-beating fourth-quarter earnings report that has FB stock primed to set new all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook stock was up 2% in Wednesday's after-market trading, adding onto 16% year-to-date gains to make it one of the best-performing blue chips on the market. You can thank FB's unrelenting operational growth, which took center stage Wednesday afternoon.For its Q4, Facebook posted a sizzling 53% surge in revenues to $8.83 billion, and earnings that came to $1.41 per share. Wall Street was looking for sales of $8.52 billion and profits of $1.31 per share.That marked the seventh straight beat for Facebook, which had plenty of highlights in its Q4 report:Daily active users (DAUs) jumped 18% to 1.23 billion.Mobile DAUs rose 23% to 1.15 billion.Mobile advertising revenue came to 84% of all advertising revenue, up from 80% in the same period a year ago.The cash balance is now at $29.45 billion.Some investors were wary heading into Wednesday's announcement following a Q3 report that also saw top- and bottom-line beats, butdisappointed on the guidance front. That sent FB stock to one of its biggest dips since the company's 2012 initial public offering.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryShould the after-market gains hold, Facebook shares will be in brand-new territory.FB shares currently sit above all their important moving averages, and the break above all-time highs would take out the last remaining bit of price resistance.Also important to note is Facebook's 2%-plus run in Wednesday's regular trading hours, during which FB stock scrawled out a golden cross - a bullish technical indicator that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day MA.But as for the fundamentals, it is important to put the growth into perspective. Consider thatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is only growing its top line at about 20%-plus andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) is posting increases of only 8%. So FB is really in a league of its own, especially given its massive size.Yet it certainly helps that the company continues to find new users. According toa tweetfrom Bloomberg's Shira Ovide: ""Facebook in a year added 269 million monthly active users. Nearly a whole Twitter's worth of users in one year.""Despite all this, there probably should still be caution with Facebook stock. Keep in mind that management has indicated that the torrid growth rates cannot continue. Although, it is far from certain to what degree. In the prior quarter, the CFO pointed out that there could be""meaningful""drop.OK then, why might there be a slowdown? First of all, it will probably get tougher to find new users. For example, Facebook is banned in China. And rivals in the country, likeWeibo Corp (ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), have been capitalizing on the opportunity.Besides, the fourth-quarter growth was bolstered with holiday spending - which drives quite a bit of ad spending - as well as the presidential election, which relied heavily on social media. Oh, and then there was the controversy with ""fake news."" FB has already implemented systems to reduce this, which could result in fewer clicks.And finally, Wall Street's reaction to the Q4 results has been fairly muted. Hey, shouldn't there be more of a spike - given the huge growth numbers? Then again, investors have already been factoring in much of the good news - and then some. What's more, with the upcoming Snapchat IPO, the offering may mean that investors will plow some of their winnings from Facebook stock into the new offering.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Why Is Wal-Mart Scrapping Its Membership Shipping Program?;2/1/2017;"Wal-Mart (WMT) is now providing free two-day shipping to all its customers on orders of $35 or more instead of charging a membership fee of $49 per year through its existing shipping program, ShippingPass. This comes as one of the first major changes since Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com last year. ((Wal-Mart offers free two-day shipping in latest attempt to compete with Amazon, Reuters, Jan 31 2017)) This appears to be a move to better compete with Amazon's Prime service.The e-commerce market in the U.S. continues to grow at a steady rate, as online orders accounted for 8.4% of total retail sales in Q3 2016, up from 7.4% in the comparable 2015 quarter. As online sales growth continues to outpace the total retail market, retailers need to focus on enhancing their online platforms to meet the increasing demand. With this move, Wal-Mart hopes to be accomplishing just that.Wal-Mart Faces Tough Competition From Amazon   PrimemakeArticleAd();Wal-Mart first started testing its ShippingPass program in May 2015 and also tried to boost its demand by offering a 30-day free trial in 2016. However, the program did not perform as well as the company expected, while Amazon Prime remains very popular among online shoppers. Prime has almost 65 million members in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Its renewal rates have been pegged at north of 90%. Prime charges $99 a year for two-day shipping on more than 30 million items, and also offers a number of additional features to the service as a way to keep customers on board. These services include Amazon Instant Video, streaming and unlimited photo storage. Accordingly, ShippingPass had a difficult time competing.Wal-Mart plans to compete with Amazon by providing free shipping on orders of $35 or more to its value-conscious customers. Going forward, Wal-Mart aims to garner a greater share of total U.S. online sales, which are expected to reach$523 billionby 2020.Please refer toour complete analysis for Wal-MartSee More at Trefis|View Interactive Institutional Research(Powered by Trefis)Get Trefis Technology"

Several factors have come together over the past few months that have made the coming year ripe for consolidation. Industries like biotechnology and retail were beaten down in 2016, and that has opened the door for a flurry of activity within those sectors.makeArticleAd();Not only that, but the Donald Trump administration could also provide a boost for M&A activity. Trump's ""America first"" focus, as well as his plans to loosen regulations weighing on U.S. corporations, may make it easier for companies to merge.One of President Trump's campaign promises was to reduce the tax burden that U.S. companies face. A lower corporate tax rate means U.S. firms will enjoy an influx of cash, which could in turn give them the means they need to invest in growth via mergers & acquisitions.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryHere's a look at three firms that are likely to see some M&A action in the year ahead.Possible Mergers & Acquisitions: Netflix(NFLX)Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)Streaming serviceNetflix Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has seen its share price soar over the past two years as the firm expanded its reach across the globe. NFLX has been able to tap into popular culture and create original series that appeal to the masses. The firm has also made its way overseas and proven that online streaming services are gaining traction across the globe.As one of the most popular names in the industry, Netflix's expertise makes it an appealing takeover target for tech firms that need to add streaming to their business model. While companies likeWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might be interested in snapping NFLX up, it'sApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) that has the most potential as a buyer.Apple not only has the cash necessary to make such a large acquisition, but the company stands to gain quite a lot by owning NFLX.Netflix has done for movies and TV what Apple did for music back in the early 2000's. However, in recent months AAPL has taken a lot of flak for being unable to innovate. By adding NFLX stock's streaming business to its repertoire, Apple would put itself at the forefront of the entertainment business.Possible Mergers & Acquisitions: Barnes & Nobel (BKS)Source:Mike Kalasnik via Flickr (modified)Brick-and-mortar bookstoreBarnes & Nobel, Inc.(NYSE:BKS) has been struggling under the weight of online retailers, namelyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), and now the company's depressed stock price makes it an appealing takeover target.One firm that is likely to be interested in adding BKS to its business is the company that single-handedly pressured the bookstore into this position- Amazon. AMZN has recentlymade a push into having its own physical bookstores, and Barnes and Nobel's locations could be easily converted into Amazon locations with very few expensive upgrades.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Not only has Barnes & Noble followed in Amazon's footsteps by offering an electronic e-reader, but BKS locations have a designated space in each store where the e-readers are sold. That would make it relatively easy for Amazon to rebrand the stores and sell their own Kindle devices.Possible Mergers & Acquisitions: Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD)Source: ShutterstockThe biotech space is prime takeover territory, as the sector has been beaten down over the past year, making consolidation within the industry much more likely. Investors can expect to see a flurry of M&A activity in this space throughout the coming year as bigger firms look to beef up their drug portfolios by acquiring their smaller, more specialized peers.Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc(NASDAQ:ACAD) is one such company that is likely to see some takeover action sometime over the course of the year. The company has already been the subject of takeover rumors over the past few months, and 2017 looks like the year it might happen.One of the reasons Acadia looks so enticing to big pharma firms is the company's drug Nuplazid, which has already been approved to treat psychosis experienced by those affected by Parkinson's disease. However, what's more promising is the fact that Nuplazidmay also gain approvalto be used for other mental illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease - which could become a major money maker.It's unclear which firm will strike first, but rumor has it that everyone fromPfizer Inc.(NYSE:PFE) toBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) toGilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) is interested in buying Acadia.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL and NFLX stock.The post3 Big Mergers & Acquisitions That We Could See in 2017appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?;2/1/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently announced that  it will invest over   $1 billion per year on cybersecurity research and development.   That amount, which is equivalent to roughly 8% of its R&D   spend over the past 12 months, doesn't include any acquisitions   that Microsoft might make. Let's see why Microsoft is beefing up   its cybersecurity efforts, and what that could mean for smaller   players across the fragmented industry.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecurity means to MicrosoftMicrosoft's Windows is the most widely used PC operating   system in the world, Office is the  most popular   productivity suite, and Azure is the second largest cloud   platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of this massive ecosystem has   traditionally been protected by third party companies.   Microsoft's own products -- like Windows Firewall, Windows   Defender, and Microsoft Security Essentials -- were  often   considered inferior to third-party ones.However, Microsoft's ecosystem has become more cohesive under   CEO Satya Nadella's ""One Windows"" strategy, which aims to install   the same OS and app store across multiple platforms. Since users   would ideally download apps from the Windows Store and deliver   their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logical to   add first-party, self-updating security solutions across the   entire ecosystem. Microsoft claims that the number of weekly   cyber attacks has risen from 20,000 to as many as 700,000 over   the past two to three years.To counter those threats while expanding its ecosystem,   Microsoft acquired three Israeli cybersecurity firms over the   past two years -- enterprise security start-up Aorato, cloud   security firm Adallom, and data protection firmSecure Islands. Those acquisitions and its planned R&D investments could   help Azure challenge AWS, which already integrates an    arsenal of security features into its cloud infrastructure   platform. Azure's revenue surged 93% annually last quarter, but   Microsoft hasn't revealed its exact sales figures yet.How this could hurt smaller playersAs Microsoft's cybersecurity ecosystem grows, it could overlap   with the services of many smaller stand-alone third-party   players. For example, Microsoft recently  launched Windows   Defender ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) for Windows 10. That   endpoint service matches events with Microsoft's cloud-based   Security Graph, which gathers data across over a billion Windows   devices worldwide. It also works with Microsoft's email   protection services from Office 365 and Microsoft Advanced Threat   Analytics.This platform directly competes against ""perimeter"" players   like threat prevention firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . During last year's RSA Conference, Microsoft   principal research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Windows Defender ATP can ""help capture network traffic out   of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks""   as FireEye and other threat detection services.Consider what $1 billion means to these smaller cybersecurity   companies. Palo Alto and FireEye are expected to respectively   generate $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenues this year --   so there's no way that they could match Microsoft's R&D   investments. Windows, Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other   platforms all give Microsoft the ability to bundle and scale up   its cybersecurity services very quickly. It can also offer lower   prices and offset those losses across other parts of its   ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecurity firms could still     surviveMicrosoft's growing interest in the cybersecurity market could   render some smaller players obsolete, but ""best in breed"" players   like FireEye and Palo Alto have survived similar assaults from   bundled players before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, has aggressively bundled threat   prevention and next-gen firewalls into its networking hardware   and software. Yet FireEye still serves 5,000 customers across 67   countries, which includes nearly half of the Forbes Global 2000.   Palo Alto serves over 35,500 customers in more than  140   countries, including 80 of the Fortune 100 and half of the Global   2000.Those numbers indicate that companies will likely value a   company's track record and reputation over the convenience of   cheaper bundles. They also indicate that it could be smarter for   Microsoft to either acquire or partner with smaller stand-alone   players instead of trying to render them obsolete.The key takeawayBeefing up its cybersecurity business will help Microsoft   counter Amazon and tighten up its ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While   some of the new features seem destined to crush third-party   security players, investors should remember that companies will   likely stick with ""best in breed"" players instead of the cheapest   bundle, and a mass switch to a new security platform can be   costly and time consuming.Therefore, investors in cybersecurity companies should be   mindful of Microsoft's ambitions, but they should remember that   many ""best in breed"" companies have weathered similar attacks   from companies like Cisco before.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Buy This Old Dog for Its New Tricks;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompanies likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are rare for a reason. You can call it the Polaroid effect: Scientist and inventor Edwin H. Land's idea for a light polarizing lens sparked multiple innovations, includinginstant photography.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrTogether with businessman George Wheelwright, Land formed Polaroid in 1937. Land and Wheelwright completely dominated the instant photography sector, until that sector was no longer relevant. Once considered an economic bellwether,Polaroiddeclared bankruptcyin 2001.True, the company is back on the wheel again, but not before taking down its original investors. Worst of all, they're an afterthought. Polaroid is seemingly stuck in a reality that hasseen its zenith30 years ago. It's a fate that anyone vested in MSFT stock will obviously want to avoid. Still, it is a legitimate fear, especially among technology companies. In this day and age, if you're not ahead, you're almost intractably behind.MSFT Stock Is Getting the Job DoneBased on its most recent second-quarterearnings report, Microsoft stock is in good hands. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 3.6%, matching consensus estimates for 79 cents per share. Top-line sales increased by a 2.2% margin over the year-ago level, which slightly exceeded forecasts. While InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli is correct in pointing out that these aren't earth-shattering figures for MSFT stock, they're more than good enough.I've made the argument before that Microsoft stock issteady, not sexy- and that's not a bad thing. Sure, everybody lovesFerrari N.V.(NYSE:RACE) and its incredible machines. Rarely do people rave when they have to spend an inordinate amount of time in the shop. I'm not suggesting that MSFT stock is the market equivalent of a minivan; what I am saying is that it's not going to pull too many unwanted surprises.Take a look at the broader picture of its earnings performances. In the past fourteen quarters inclusive of the latest Q2, MSFT shares have only failed to meet earnings consensus twice. Of those misses, the negative surprise averaged 6% below forecast. While that's a notable ding, the total average earnings surprise for Microsoft stock in the aforementioned time frame is well over 8%.No matter how you look at it, that's a respectable trend. It's especially true given that MSFT is an old dog with fierce rivals chomping at the bit.Microsoft Is Still in the Innovation GameCEO Satya Nadella has made it no secret that he wants MSFT stock to be more than just a play on software and computers. To that end, the company has been investing heavily in cloud applications. It's a market that is projected to jump from last year's$204 billionto$318 billionin two years' time.Unfortunately, it's a market that has stiff opposition for Microsoft stock. Public enemy number one isAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which commands air superiority in the cloud.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) are big league players that are eager to make their presence known. Certainly, they're not going to make the ride easy for those vested in MSFT shares.This, however, is one of those areas where being an old dog has its advantages. Primarily, MSFT stock carries the leverage of a ubiquitous, utilitarian brand. While SAP and Oracle have powerful cloud applications, chances are, unless you're a business analyst for a Fortune 500 company, you're not going to be too familiar with their platforms. Even Amazon has a little bit of a vulnerability in this area, considering that it's mostly used as an e-commerce function.For Microsoft stock, it's all about selling the trust factor. Everybody - from the high school student writing a research paper to experts from all industries -knows MSFT's platform. Many of us have literally grown up with the company. Already, there's an entire generation of workers that have known nothing but Microsoft Windows' graphical user interface.MSFT Is Backed by Smart MovesThis familiarity definitely carries substance to it. Back in January of 2014 - after the ""One Microsoft"" brand message was launched - the tech giant became themost trustedcompany according to a brand survey conducted by Forrester Research. Beating outApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), this ledForresteranalyst Tracy Stokes to conclude that Microsoft ""has a utilitarian essentiality, not the kind of emotional essentiality that Apple relies on.""Although the remarks were made three years ago, they're still spot on today. For example, Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn gives it an incredible professional network: LinkedIn has467 million usersand 128 million in the U.S. - roughly 40% of our total national population. Better yet for MSFT stock, that 40% represents the company's target audience - tech savvy, money-making individuals.Here's Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-PlusTo be sure, Microsoft has a lot of challenges.

Buy Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Now, Worry About Valuations Later;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBloomberg's headline last week aboutAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) says it all -""Alibaba Adds $7.5 Billion in Market Value After Raising Forecast.""makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt leaves little doubt about the quality of itsthird-quarter 2016 earnings reportthat sent Alibaba stock above $100 for the third time in its brief 28-month history as a public company.Other InvestorPlace contributors have already covered thehighlightsof BABA's successful quarter, so I won't dwell too much on the specific numbers. Rather, I thought I'd examine where Alibaba stock might be headed considering that its business is still very much in growth mode.Where Alibaba Stock Is HeadedDana Blankenhornsees BABA hitting its all-time highof $120 in the near future despite its rich valuation, because there are very few growth stories out there as compelling as ""The House That Jack Built,"" including Jeff Bezos' $400 billion behemoth.Sure, Alibaba stock is perceived by some to be a one-trick pony generating 80% of its revenue from Chinese commerce, but Blankenhorn reminds readers that it's so much more than that and when the various pieces of its business get built out and mature, you'll wish you had bought at $102 where it's currently trading.How can you argue with logic? You can't and I won't. I'm old enough to remember whenAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) faced the same concerns from investors about a lack of revenue diversification and along came thecloudand it was off to the races.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAn example of how Alibaba is using its e-commerce expertise for future growth aretwopotential investments the company will make in traditional retail: The first is a 35% stake inSanjiang Shopping Club, a Chinese grocery store chain that will leverage Alibaba's know-how to improve the shopping experience for its customers; the second move is its $2.6 billion offer to acquire theIntime Retail Group, a Chinese department store operator that owns 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls.Both Bezos and Ma have come to the same conclusion that e-commerce can be more successful, not less, by having brick-and-mortar stores to provide a truly omnichannel shopping experience for its customers.Retail today is about meeting your customer where they are 24/7; while it seems young people do nothing but stare at screens all day (smartphone, tablet, desktop, TV), millennials actuallyprefer shopping in a physical store(70% according to 2016 CBRE survey) rather than online.Millennials will do research online when looking to buy something, but when push comes to shove they're interested in going to the store first to try it out and then take it home once they're sold. That's great news for car dealers.What does any of this have to do with the headline?Recently, I suggested that BABA stock investors might want to protect themselves fromthe swoon in Alibaba stock, something that's happened early in both the 2015 and 2016 calendar years. History repeats itself.Four of the most expensive words in the English language are ""this time it's different,"" often said by investors when defending an investment that's incredibly overvalued and due for a fall - think real estate around 2007.In the case of Alibaba, I wasn't suggesting that Alibaba stock wasn't a buy. Rather, I was simply providing some options on how to play BABA stock given the trading pattern it's established since its IPO.Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD): A Great American Tragedy Nears Its EndThe simple fact is that Alibaba generated $2.5 billion in net profit in Q3 2016, $4.9 billion in non-GAAP free cash flow and $7.7 billion in revenue. That's a huge company on its own without adding the other three quarters on top of it.If ever there were a stock that could break free of its technical analysis shackles, Alibaba stock would be it. Is this time different? Alibaba's latest earnings report suggests it is. So, buy away. Valuations be damned.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postBuy Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Now, Worry About Valuations Laterappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC), Baxter International Inc (BAX) and Danaher Corporation (DHR);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis week, one of the surprise sectors for this earnings season is the health care stocks. Shares ofAmerisourceBergen Corp.(NYSE:ABC),Baxter International Inc(NYSE:BAX) andDanaher Corporation(NYSE:DHR) are surging after earnings results sparked one-day rallies, the question we'll ask today is ""are these stocks ready to run higher?"" Let's take a look at the charts.makeArticleAd();AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC)AmerisourceBergen shares shot higher after their results beat analyst expectations. Expectations for the health care sector have been muted given the uncertainty around the regulatory environment for these stocks.Regardless, the better-than-expected results broke ABC stock above its recent trading range and it looks to move even higher.AmerisourceBergen has a confluence of technical trendlines that have been building into a bullish case for the stock. Currently, ABC's trendlines are tangled-up at the $81-mark, but will quickly begin to accelerate into intermediate-term bullish patterns.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeAmerisourceBergen broke above its top Bollinger Band on the earnings move, suggesting that we are likely to see some upside volatility move ABC stock quickly towards $92.Baxter International Inc (BAX)Baxter International shares join the health care stocks that outperformed on earnings this week. As a result, we're seeing an opportunity for BAX stock to make a fast move higher to the $51-level and higher.Baxter shares broke above their top Bollinger Band Tuesday, indicating that we're going to see increased volume and higher prices as the traders begin to pile back into the name.Analysts have been cool on the healthcare sector lately, as they expect the regulatory environment to become as clear as mud, but much of this sentiment has already been priced into these stocks as they have lagged the market for the last six months.BAX shares have been a relative strength leader in the group, meaning that we should expect the ""crowd"" to take the latest earnings and price movement as a signal that the bullish train is ready to pull out of the station on some of these stocks. That will attract more interest and buyers to Baxter.Short interest on BAX shares was on the decline, suggesting that the probability for a short covering has been removed from the situation, but as one of the few stocks in the sector making new highs, we expect the volatility rally to be fast and decisively bullish.Danaher Corporation (DHR)There's one final health care company to attend to today with Danaher Corporation. DHR stock rallied almost 5% after its earnings report provided a positive surprise, but traders want to be careful in jumping on this stock thinking that a new trend is forming.Our chart analysis of Danaher shows that the stock tends to spend more time in tight trading ranges because of lower volume trading on the name. Earnings moves on DHR tend to be the larger of the moves each quarter and rarely trigger a new bullish trend.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonYesterday, trading volume on Danaher was heavy because of the reaction to the earnings report; this sent the stock right into overbought territory.The one-day 5% rally put DHR shares into new high territory, but today's price reaction will be the one that traders want to make a move on.A reversal from today's highs to a close back below yesterday's close will signal that the profit-takers are moving into Danaher to lock-in their profits and wait for the stock to settle back into its trading range (options premium sellers likely love this stock for that).Based on these three charts, DHR is the stock that is most likely to pull itself back from its highs with our price target of $80.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: AmerisourceBergen Corp.

Here’s Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plus;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndustrial conglomerateGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) and GE stock didn't excite investors with breathtaking earnings results last week, but the Dow component continues to improve its Aviation segment - the second-largest unit - which posted a 7% jump in fourth-quarter revenue.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockCombined with the 35% jump in profits and the company'scontinued cash returnto shareholders, GE stock should reach $36 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering some 20% returns. And its strong 3.2% annual dividend yield, besting theS&P 500's2%, is an added bonus.The Quarter That WasLast week, GE deliveredearnings from continuing operationsof $3.48 billion, or 39 cents per share, rising from from $2.57 billion a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, GE earned 46 cents per share, which was in-line with Thomson Reuters estimates. Driven by strong improvements in its power and renewable energy businesses, revenue came to $33.09 billion.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryGE stock sold off about 5% due to the revenue miss. Wall Street expected $33.9 billion. But with OPEC agreeing for the first time in eight years to a production cut of 1.2 million barrels a day, it's reasonable to expect General Electric to see more improvements in power, oil and gas, and renewable energy in the near future. And while the transportation and healthcare businesses were light, investors overlooked the fact that GE continues to expect$2 per-shareearnings in 2018.What's more, the fact that the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2017 of 3% to 5% organic growth, margin expansion and plans to return as much as $21 billion to shareholders suggests confidence in its business.Likewise, the company's backlog total, a closely-watched metric of future revenue, continues to climb. And as GE continues to embrace the goal of becoming a high-value added pure-play industrial company, GE stock is poised to benefit from that execution.Bottom Line for GE StockWhen factoring in possible gains from President Donald Trump's proposed tax reform and infrastructure spending plans, GE stock currently priced at just 15.5 times fiscal 2018 estimates of $1.91 per share, looks like a bargain.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonGE stock is currently trading around $29.80. Assuming GE does achieve $2 per share in 2018, this puts the forward P/E at 15, or four points below the S&P 500 Index. And when applying a reasonable multiple of 18 to those estimates, the stock's fair value points to $36.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a Portfolio3 Gold Stocks to Mine for ProfitsThe postHere's Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plusappeared first onInvestorPlace."
What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."
Here's How Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon Stack Up on Free Shipping;2/1/2017;"Earlier this week,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) tried to jump-start its online business by dropping   its $50 annual fee for free two-day shipping, replacing it with   an offer of free two-day shipping on any orders over $35. It's a   move designed to get people who payAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $99 a year for free two-day shipping (and some   other perks) through its Prime membership to consider switching.   Even if those customers don't drop Amazon Prime, or switch   completely to Wal-Mart, the retailer's new offer might encourage   people to compare prices more often.Wal-Mart's new eCommerce CEO Marc Lore lauded the move in apress release. The executive has a long history as an entrepreneur and came to   his new position when Wal-Mart bought his Jet.com start-up for $3   billion.""I couldn't be more excited. We are moving at the speed of a   start-up,"" said Lore in the press release. ""Two-day free shipping   is the first of many moves we will be making to enhance the   customer experience and accelerate growth.""makeArticleAd();This offer covers ""more than two million items,"" while Prime   claims to have ""tens of millions of items available in two days.""   But Wal-Mart is raising the stakes on free shipping and greatly   exceeding what Amazon offers non-members, while one-upping retail   rivalTarget's(NYSE: TGT) free shipping plan when it comes to speed of   delivery.Wal-Mart ships some online orders from its stores and others     from warehouses. Image source: Wal-Mart.What does each company offer?All three major retailers offer some sort of free shipping.   Here's a look at the standard offers from Wal-Mart, Target, and   Amazon. (Target and Wal-Mart have offered different holiday deals   some years.)Wal-Mart: As noted above, the company now offers free,     two-day shipping on any order over $35.Target: The retailer actually has a lower free-shipping     threshold at $25, but it offers ""standard shipping,"" which     takes 3-5 business days. The company also offers free standard     shipping on any Target.com order paid for with its REDcard     credit or debit card, though not every item is eligible.Amazon: The online retailer clearly wants people to join     Prime as its free shipping offer for those not in Prime     requires purchases of either $25 in books or $49 of eligible     items that are ""delivered 5-8 business days after all of your     items are available to ship, including pre-order items,""     according to a company webpage.If you can wait for your items, Target offers a better deal   for smaller orders, but the difference between $25 and $35 is   generally a question of adding an item or two. Target arguably   has a high-quality free shipping offer to REDcard holders, albeit   a slow one. Wal-Mart, however, clearly has the best overall free   shipping deal with no membership requirements if you combine   order minimum and speed of delivery.Can Wal-Mart catch Amazon?Lore deserves credit for thinking like a start-up executive.   Wal-Mart simply was not going to get mass buy-in to a $50-a-year   free two-day shipping membership program when Amazon Prime   already has an estimated 65 million U.S. members. Those consumers   are especially loyal to Amazon, estimated to spend on average   about $1,200 per year, compared to about $600 per year for   non-member customer.It's hard to picture massive numbers of Amazon shoppers   dropping Prime and jumping to Wal-Mart. Some value-conscious   customers might, but it's likely to be a small amount. Had   Wal-Mart made this offer before Amazon had signed up around half   the households in the U.S. for Prime, then perhaps the results   would be different.Still, while it won't cause an immediate shift in consumer   behavior, Wal-Mart's offer should jump-start its e-commerce   efforts. Lore has created a deal which might tempt people who   rarely shop online and it should make Amazon customers more   willing to buy on Walmart.com when that site has the item they   want or a better price.It's a long race and Amazon has a really big lead, but   thinking like a start-up should help Wal-Mart make up some   ground. If this is truly the first move of many, Lore has   announced his presence loudly, putting Amazon on notice.10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

It'sGroundhog Day.But despite a recall of its Karma drone and 200 layoffs, GoPro is not giving up. The Karma will be relaunched this month, the Hero cameras sold well and tomorrow will be another day.GPRO stock still has no debt, its market cap of $1.68 billion isn't much bigger than its 2015 sales and there was $224 million in cash and short-term securities on the books in September to address its problems. It can still be a solid No.2 againstChina's DJIin consumer drones and make money as the market evolves from its consumer focus to a business one.That's the hope anyway.Why GoPro Stock Is a Battlefield StockFor the quarter ending in December, analysts believe GoPro stock earned about $35 million - 27 cents per share - with revenues of about $572 million.

InvestorPlace contributor Jayson Derrick, for instance, is screamingsell, sell sell.While InvestorPlace contributor Joseph Hargett thinksthis dead cat can still bounce back.What's the real situation?Is GoPro a Drone Company?GoPro was not founded to make drones. It was founded to make cameras.It got into drones as mounts for the cameras, and discovered in 2016 that drones are tough to produce, in quantity, at a competitive price.The Karma drone had to be recalled in November, and along the way the stock had a precipitous fall from grace, dropping from $17 per share in October to less than $9 per share at the start of 2017. The drones were suddenlylosing power and crashing,a major safety risk.Management acted. It laid-off people, it changed its Christmas marketing planson a dimeand it has delivered a kit called Karma Core, a replacement body, at just$400.The Karma product was originally sold at $800.InvestorPlace contributor Brian Wu suggests that all of this is noise.

Only 2,500 Karma drones were sold in the first place, and the Hero5 camera sells in the millions of units, so that's what GPRO stock investors should be looking at.Wedbush has done some checking, finding that the Hero5 Session and Hero5 Black cameras sold well atBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), not so well atWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), and they were usually outside the top five in the action camera category atAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Despite this, its fourth-quarter earnings estimates are in-line with others, $585 million in revenue and about 24 cents per share in non-GAAP earnings.The Bottom Line on GPRO StockThe bottom line here is that GoPro management is engineering a difficult turn, from following consumer fads with cool cameras and drones, to creating business markets that don't yet exist,but will.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonThe drone market should be worth over $21 billion in five years, with commercial drones and sensors, like those GPRO makes,leading the way forward. Getting even a small share in the lower-end of that market should mean a sustainable business.Now all GoPro must do is deliver a drone that can meet that need. Whether it can, whether it will, remains a question the company must answer. You can speculate on that, or the possibility it gets acquired, but just know you're speculating.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks Soon;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether you love the company or hate it, there's no denyingAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the 800 pound gorilla in the retail room … online, or offline. Although a true market share figure would be impossible to pinpoint, without a doubt, Amazon is the name all other players fear the most, and try to mimic.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe company is slated to remind the market on Thursday exactly why AMZN stock is up more than 2000% over the course of the past ten years.Or, perhaps Thursday's post-close announcement will keep some observers wondering how this minimally profitable (until very recently) organization manages to consistently draw such a bullish crowd.Whatever the case, fireworks Thursday evening will easily carry through into Friday morning.Amazon Earnings OutlookAs of the latest look, Amazon is expected to report a profit of $1.41 per share for its fourth fiscal quarter of last year, on revenue of $44.84 billion. The company earned $1.00 per share of AMZN stock in the same quarter a year earlier, when it reported $35.75 billion worth of revenue.Amazon is headed into its quarterly earnings announcement with its usual impressive revenue-growth momentum. What's relatively new is growing profits per share of Amazon stock. Over the course of the last four quarters, AMZN has earned $4.36 per share. That's the best profitability the company has ever seen, and assuming Amazon has indeed turned a profit in its fourth quarter, 2016 will mark the first year the organization has posted a positive bottom line in every quarter of the year.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeIt's not Amazon.com's e-commerce business that's pushing the company to such profitability though. While its foreign and domestic e-tailing operations are growing, Amazon Web Services is driving a big chunk of the top line's growth, and the bulk of the company's profit growth.Case in point: During the third quarter, Amazon Web Services turned $3.2 billion in revenue (up 74% yoy) into operating income of $861 million. E-commerce sales were up 27% year-over-year, and lost money on an operating basis when factoring in the international arm's loss.Look for more of the same leadership from AWS going forward.Amazon Stock: Three Things to Chew OnAmazon reliably has several pet projects on its plate, and shifts in its respective markets consistently pose new threats to its growth. At any given time though, there are only three matters that really work for or against AMZN stock. Thursday's top hot buttons are the following:Delivery ServicesAmazon'sentry into the package delivery gamewas largely cheered by owners of Amazon stock. The move puts the company in charge of its own destiny, and may well save on shipping costs. And just this week, AMZN announced it would beestablishing a major air freight hub in Kentucky.Yet, it was also this week thatUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS) told us the advent of so many at-home deliveries driven by theongoing rise of e-commerce(Amazon's core business) is a tough way to make a buck. Amazon may not like what it gets when it starts handling more of its delivery work.Real Cash FlowIt has been a point of contention - particularly for accountants - because it somewhat obscures the true health of AMZN's cash flow. Given how big the numbers are getting though, Amazon stock owners may want to get a grip on the idea.Long story made short, the costs associated with purchasing and managing all the servers needed to operate Amazon Web Services are being booked as capital leases rather than capital expenditures. This means payment for these leases isn't deducted before calculating free cash flow … one of the metrics that's enamored so many new investors. It's not ""wrong"" per se, but it's worth understanding.More Competitive CompetitionFinally, this week, rivalWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) announced it was scrapping its membership-based free shipping scheme and insteadsimplified its online-shopping offer to free shipping for any order over $35.00.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?One new tactic from Wal-Mart won't rattle Amazon, but Wal-Mart's move is just a microcosm of a bigger theme. Everyone is collectively taking aim at Amazon.com, and sooner or later, enough of those competitors will hit the target.Bottom Line for AMZN StockAMZN shares were up 17% in 2016, and have gained 170% since the end of 2014 primarily because the market saw how potent AWS was going to be. Amazon Web Services can only do the heavy lifting for so long though. Sooner or later, e-commerce has to help out.And the fourth quarter's report could very easily be the one that prods such a change of heart.See, expectations are low - analysts are only a calling a profit of $1.41 per share for AMZN stock. On the surface it seems like an easy target to top, but if traders have reason to see the glass as half-empty rather than half-full after Thursday's close, nothing can be ruled out. Sometimes the market will punish a mere meet of lackluster estimates. (And if nothing else, investors may be ready to take some profits.)On the other hand, most of thepost-earnings responsesAMZN has made in recent quarters were bullish ones. This is one of those names investors love to love.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

GoPro (GPRO) Q4 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?;2/1/2017;"GoPro, Inc.GPROis slated to report fourth-quarter 2016 results, after the closing bell on Feb 2.The company has had a bleak earnings history, having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 26.9%. Last quarter, GoPro lagged estimates by 29.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderA lot of things have gone wrong in the fourth quarter for GoPro. The company was forced to announce a recall of its new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of its commercial launch, as a few of them lost power during flight due to battery issues.The grounding of GoPro's drone dreams follow multiple operational stumbles, including messed up launches, production delays and missed deadlines in the recent past.Karma's success was considered an integral part of GoPro's return to growth, along with the Hero5 cameras. In fact, the company had been hopeful that Karma would prove to be a hit during the holiday season, having just gone to market on Oct 23. Now, with Karma temporarily out of the picture in the all-important holiday season, we believe that there might be reason to expect that GoPro's fourth quarter might just be no better than its third.In fact, in its third-quarter report, the company had also reduced its sales target for the year, in light of weak expectations from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. This spooked investors as the company had earlier anticipated to generate nearly half of its revenue for 2016 in the holiday season. The guidance for revenues for 2016 was lowered to the range of $1.25-$1.3 billion (previous guidance: $1.35-$1.5 billion).GoPro also faced stiff competition during the holiday season, especially from Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNEcho products. This will also likely affect the fourth-quarter revenues.At one point, the company was unable to meet the projected demand of its new action cameras due to internal issues and a compromised production ramp. We expect delayed shipments owing to production and supply chain concerns to hurt revenues in the quarter under review as well.Further, analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock lately, with the company's estimates moving south over the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings has widened from a loss of $1.97 to a loss of $1.99 per share in the past month, thanks to three downward revisions compared with none upward.Unsurprisingly, GoPro's stock has had a dismal run on the bourse - having recorded an average return of just 5% over the past one year, compared with the Zacks categorizedAudio/Video Home Productsindustry's 33.6%.However big the issues it faces, GoPro still boasts an enviable retail presence. Extremely few consumer technology companies have the kind of retail presence that GoPro has and this might work in favor of the company.GoPro remains optimistic about the success of its hardware launches in 2016 and said it foresees returning to profitability in fourth-quarter 2016. For the to-be-reported quarter, the company anticipates to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of 30 cents (+/- 5 cents), on revenues of $625 million (+/- $25 million).This would be the first quarter to display the performance of GoPro's first significant update to its flagship line of action cameras in two years - the new Hero5 Black camera and the smaller, cube-shaped Hero5 Session. The Hero5 Black is arguably one of the best action cameras, currently, in the market and has received rave reviews.In fact, according to the Pacific Crest analysts, the company looks to have sold more cameras than expected during the recent holiday season, which should reflect well in the upcoming results. We believe that the new products and software updates will provide a much needed boost to GoPro's top line.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -8.33%.

The 3 Worst-Performing Stocks in January;2/1/2017;"Cold winds may blow in January, but stocks tend to get awfully   hot in the first month of the year. The so-called ""January   effect"" is the phenomenon of stocks jumping higher supposedly in   response to the tax-loss selling that occurs in December as   investors seek to offset realized capital gains during the   year.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();While January this year hasn't exactly been a barn burner --   theS&P 500is only up about 2.5% for the month -- there are actually a few   stocks that haven't enjoyed similar gains. Or any at all, for   that matter. In fact, of the 25 worst-performing stocks in   January, three of them were well-known clothing retailers.Kohl's: Down 19.6%Almost all ofKohl's(NYSE: KSS) losses occurred on one day at the beginning of the   month when the retail sector revealed just how bad the Christmas   shopping season was. As brick-and-mortar retailers continue to   struggle against theAmazoneffect -- a much more powerful force than the January effect,   depending upon the business you're in -- Kohl's proved to be theworst of the bunch, plunging 19% all at once.Image source: Flickr via Mike Mozart.The retailer said its comparable sales fell 2.1% in November   and December, leading to a 2.7% drop in total sales, a result   that was exacerbated by its closing down numerous stores. But the   department store operator was forced to cut its full-year   earnings guidance substantially because of the poor showing, and   told investors they could now anticipate its adjusted earnings to   come in between $3.60 and $3.65 per share compared to its   previous guidance of range of $3.80 to $4.00 per share.Although the stock has mostly stabilized after the fall, it   still is trending south, making January a very chilly month for   Kohl's.J.C. Penney: Down 21.2%Like Kohl's, the kickoff to the new year wasn't kind toJ.C. Penney(NYSE: JCP) , either. While the Christmas update wasn't very   flattering for the department store chain, it wasn't hit nearly   as bad as its peer -- the stock only fell about 6% that day --   but that might be because J.C. Penney had been falling since   early December and the market wasn't expecting much good news   from it anyway.Image source: The Motley Fool.Still, even though it survived the early January carnage that   took down rivals likeMacy's(down 14% in one day),Nordstrom(down 10%), andL Brands(down 9%), J.C. Penney has continued to fall throughout the month   as it becomes increasingly doubtful the retailer will be able to   live up to CEO Marvin Ellison's promise to turn a profit for   2016. Comparable sales haven't been nearly as robust as   originally predicted -- even after they were revised down -- and   with comps turning negative during November and December, the   picture is looking bleak.Tailored Brands: Down 23.8%""Easy come, easy go"" is the catchphrase that applies to men's   clothing retailerTailored Brands(NYSE: TLRD) , which saw shares get a big boost in December after   it seemed the turnaround at its Jos. A. Bank brand was finally   gaining traction, only to lose virtually all those gains in   January.Tailored Brands said in December comps at Jos. A. Bank were   down ""only"" 9%, and while that would normally be considered a   disaster for any other company, it was a big improvement for the   men's suits retailer that had been regularly reporting comps   falling 20% or more for several quarters. The better results led   the retailer to raise earnings guidance for the year.Image source: Getty Images.Although there was no specific news that caused Tailored   Brands to start falling again, the general malaise of the retail   sector coupled with its own internal weaknesses may have led to   the steady decline in its shares. Moreover, with the Bureau of   Economic Analysis reporting last week the U.S.' GDP rose only   1.9% in the fourth quarter, it likely helped push Tailored Brands   stock down an additional 3.5% as gloom settled more heavily on   the sector.Even so, it still has had one of the best performances over   the past year, with shares some 54% higher, but it looks like it   will have a hard time replicating that performance in 2017.10 stocks we like better than J.C.

It has gained 43.22% compared with the industry's gain of 40.93%.State officials announced that the local airport board has approved a 50-year lease for Amazon for up to 900 acres of airport property that the company will use to build loading, unloading and sorting facilities. The project will generate 2,700 full- and part-time jobs, the officials stated.Amazon has received a preliminary approval for $40 million in tax incentives over the next 10 years from The Kentucky Economic Development Authority.Amazon's current cargo fleet consists of 16 leased Boeing 767 cargo jets.

Whirlpool & Meritage Homes Renew Deal to Bolster Growth;2/1/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Whirlpool CorporationWHRtook another step to reinforce its focus on strengthening ties with big-wigs in order to augment growth. The company renewed its four-year deal with the seventh-largest public homebuilder in the U.S., Meritage Homes CorporationMTH, with effect from Jun 1, 2016.Per the renewed contract, Meritage Homes will continue to feature Whirlpool's Amana, Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air brand appliances in its homes across the nation. Whirlpool remains pleased with its experience with Meritage Homes so far and is looking forward to offer leading energy-saving appliances to the homebuilder in the future.Based in Scottsdale, Meritage constructs and sells nuclear-family homes, mainly for move-up, first-time, luxury and active adults. The company primarily operates across the Western, Southern and Southeastern parts of the U.S., and has constructed over 100,000 homes over a span of about 31 years.We believe that the renewed contract will benefit both Whirlpool and Meritage Homes. On one hand, Whirlpool is likely to gain from Meritage Homes' geographic reach, efficiency and popularity. On the other hand, Whirlpool's industry leading products will propel growth at Meritage Homes by enhancing customer experience.This is not the first time that Whirlpool has undertaken such a step. This leading home appliances producer has recently inked a deal with Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNto launch voice-activated home appliances. This feature will be accessible through Whirlpool's expertise on Alexa-enabled devices such as Echo and Echo Dot.Alexa, developed by Amazon, an eCommerce giant, enables users to interact or control compatible devices by saying a wake word - a word to awaken Alexa and make it functional. This software will allow users to run smart home equipment with voice commands and simultaneously engage in various household chores.Whirlpool has also launched its new Whirlpool Smart All-in-One Care Washer and Dryer Combo and the Zera Food Recycler. These product launches stand proof to the company's focus on enriching consumer experience via innovations, a key avenue for growth. In fact, Whirlpool's robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives helped it deliver record earnings for the fifth consecutive quarter in 2016, which was released last week.Driven by these factors, the company has outperformed theConsumer Discretionarysector in the last one year. Evidently, Whirlpool's shares have grown 32.2% in the last one year, compared to the sector's gain of 21.7%.Whirlpool currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 Top Big Brand Stocks to Buy Now;1/31/2017;"When it comes to stocks, bigger is not always better.Sometimes name recognition works against a company, in that   some investors happily buy shares in companies they've heard of.   That's the stock market equivalent of when novice horse racing   fans bet aggressively on a contender based solely on the horse's   name. You don't want your investment thesis to be the equivalent   of someone placing $2 to win on a horse named ""Can't Possibly   Lose.""It's not that the horse is a bad horse or that a share of a   popular company always means you shouldn't buy it. Instead, when   making either choice, you want to ignore the name and look at the   fundamentals. Whether you're asking ""Does this horse have what it   takes to win the race?"" or ""Does this company have what it needs   for long-term success?"" -- that's what you need to examine.makeArticleAd();The three companies here are all big brands -- names you most   certainly know. They're also companies with the building blocks   in place to move even higher. While they aren't bargains, they're   long-term buy-and-hold stocks that are poised for steady, strong   growth.Amazon's Alexa-enabled Echo and Dot are creating a new     business for the company. Image source: Amazon.com.Amazon has become something moreThere was a timeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) was mostly an online bookstore. It then became a   marketplace that eventually started selling pretty much   everything, and then it became that plus a company that dabbled   in devices. Now, with the success of the company's cloud business   and its rapidly growing Echo/Alexa platform, the online retailer   has become a three-headed monster.At the end of Q3, the company had seen its year-to-date   product sales grow by over $10 billion, from $52.65 billion in   the first nine months of 2015 to $64.03 billion during that   period in 2016. In addition, the company has increased its   service revenue -- mostly its Amazon Web Services cloud business   -- from $18.6 billion over three quarters in 2015 to $28.2   billion through nine months of 2016, another nearly $10 billion   improvement.The company doesn't break down numbers for its device sales,   but the Echo, powered by the company's Alexa artificial   intelligence, has been a breakout hit that has essentially   created a new category forcing nearly all the major tech players   to launch rival products. CEO Jeff Bezos didn't go into exact   numbers, but he did share some info on Echo/Alexa's success in   theQ3 earnings release.Alexa may be Amazon's most loved invention yet -- literally     -- with over 250,000 marriage proposals from customers and     counting. And she's just getting better. Because Alexa's brain     is in the cloud, we can easily and continuously add to her     capabilities and make her more useful.Bezos might be using humor to illustrate a point, but Alexa   goes beyond just selling devices for the company. It's an entry   into home automation and a synergistic opportunity for Amazon to   sell more products, music subscriptions, and anything else as it   becomes embedded in consumers' kitchens and living rooms.Starbucks has a new way to grow revenueStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) shares dipped after the company reported its Q1   earnings. Investors reacted to same-store sales in the United   States coming in below expectations. COO and incoming CEO Kevin   Johnson talked about how that happened in part because Mobile   Order & Pay created congestion at the front of stores, where   people wait to pick up their order, causing some people to walk   away without ordering anything.The Starbucks Roastery in Seattle may be the model for a new     business. Image source: Starbucks.That particular problem is a logistical blip the company can   easily solve in coming quarters. It's more important that   Starbucks has trained its customers to use the digital system   that takes people out of line, allowing for more workers behind   the limited counter space to focus on drink production rather   than order-taking. In the long run -- once the logistics get   solved -- that lets stores serve more customers, increasing sales   potential.In addition to having technology that should help the company   grow over the long term, Starbucks also had some strong results   that show it can succeed with its premium Roastery/Reserve brand.   Sales at the Starbucks Roastery in Seattle grew by 24% in 2016   over the previous year and were up another 18% in Q1 2017. CEO   Howard Schultz attributed that to an average ticket that comes in   at four times what a typical customer spends in a regular   store.Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and     strategically expand our portfolio of Roasteries is supported     by the one-of-a-kind, ultra-premium Reserve experience our     Roasteries deliver to our customers, and the accelerating     outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle     Roastery.The company plans to expand on that opportunity by opening   Roasteries in Shanghai in 2017, followed by New York in 2018,   Tokyo that same year, and a not-yet-picked European city after   that. The chain also plans to open 1,000 or more premium Reserve   stores around the world and add Reserve bars to a   not-yet-determined number of stores. These new formats, along   with Starbucks' ability to leverage technology to make its stores   more efficient, should lead to increased growth   opportunities.Netflix has room to grow globallyWhile Starbucks and Amazon's growth potential takes some   explaining,Netflix's(NASDAQ: NFLX) doesn't. The company has shown staggering growth   over the past year, adding 7.05 million global subscribers in Q4,   following over 12 million added in the previous three quarters.   Only 4.69 million of those came from the U.S., which, with 49.43   million of the company's 93.8 million total global membership,   has become a mature market.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings explained during the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call that the streaming leader has become   stronger as it has grown its library.Netflix keeps adding to its lineup of original content.     Image source: Netflix.Think of it as it's a cumulative effect. Very few people     will join Netflix just because of a single title. But there's a     tipping point. We have one more title that has great     excitement, you're hearing a lot about, and that triggers you     to finally sign up for Netflix.Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos expanded on what Hastings   said. He explained that as time goes on and new originals are   added, the appeal of the product becomes stronger.We have multiple seasons of our shows, and we see that the     audience continues to build cumulatively and therefore the     excitement for the upcoming season builds as well. So, in Q2 of     this year, we have new seasons of a lot of our very popular     shows, likeOrange Is the New Black,Kimmy Schmidt,Bloodline,Sense8,Master of None, and we think that they should have a pretty nice impact on     our subscriber growth as well.Because Netflix's biggest draw is its own content -- an asset   it owns -- the company's appeal only gets stronger as time goes   on. That means that not only will holdouts eventually have so   much they want to watch they succumb and join, but existing   members also won't be tempted to leave.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Pops Following Vindicating Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) needed a strong showing in its recently completed quarter, in the shadow of three straight quarters of waning revenue and waning earnings. It got it, sending AAPL stock up 2.6% in Tuesday's after-hours trading.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleFor the company's first fiscal quarter ending in December, Apple reported income of $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion. Both were better than analyst expectations for a profit of $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion. AAPL posted income of $3.28 per share in the same quarter a year earlier, when it generated $75.87 billion in sales.CEO Tim Cook commented on the results:""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""CFO Luca Maestri added:""Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow. We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.""Apple EarningsWhile AAPL stock has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basisin each of the prior three quarters. The same goes for revenue. Q1's numbers largely rekindle confidence in the company's prospects.Almost as important as Apple's top and bottom lines for the first fiscal quarter of the year was the number of iPhones it sold during the accounting period in question.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBroadly speaking, the pace of sales growth of the iPhone has been slowing as saturation and better competition chip away at Apple's prowess in the market. TheiPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released in September, before the end of the previous quarter.The bulk of the device's sales, though, came in the subsequent quarter beginning in October. During that three-month span, the company sold 78.2 million of the smartphone ($58.4 billion worth of the device), versus expectations of 77.3 million. The company didn't indicate how many of those were iPhone 7 phones, but Cowen & Co. had forecast 58.5 million iPhone 7's were sold during fiscal Q1.The company's fast-growing digital product arm - music, video and apps - drove respectable revenue during the quarter as well.Digital content as a revenue source had not been a priority for AAPL until sales of Macs, iPhones and iPads began to slow down last year. The companyturned up the heat on this line last year, however, and has turned the unit into Apple's second-biggest piece of revenue pie. Last quarter it contributed $7.17 billion worth of sales, up 18% from year-ago levels, and accounting for 9% of total sales. Analysts had only expected $7.07 billion worth of services revenue.Apple is evenmulling the creation of its own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Geographically, the Americas continue to provide the bulk of Apple's revenue, though China and its neighbors provided the majority of revenuegrowthlast quarter.The Americas accounted for $31.9 billion in Apple's sales last quarter, up 58%. China put $16.2 billion worth of revenue on the table, up 85% year-over-year. Japan and the rest of the Asia-Pacific area only contributed $5.9 billion in sales, but that tally was up 119% versus the tally from the same quarter a year earlier.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!The future of Apple's business in China hangs in the balance. President Donald Trump's policy plans are said by some to be the beginning of a trade war.Not only would that make iPhones more difficult to sell in China, but would strain Apple's relationships with key manufacturers of iPhone, iPad and Mac components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockLooking ahead, Apple anticipates revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the quarter currently underway. The company doesn't provide earnings guidance, but as of the latest look, the pros collectively believe Apple will earn $2.09 per share of Apple stock on revenue of $53.94 billion.Both figures are higher than year-ago comparisons, and those estimates may well be adjusted higher before the second quarter numbers are posted.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postApple Inc.

Is Voice Search an Opportunity or a Threat to Google?;1/31/2017;"Image source: Google.Consumers are doing more and more web searches just by   talking. And they're not just asking the digital assistants on   their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as   theAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random   queries.makeArticleAd();For Google, the subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a   double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for   users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't   have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how   companies can monetize voice search with ads.Even as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still   fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads   within search results. That's not possible with voice   searches.But Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more   opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,"" he   told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I   wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.Losing the hardware battleGoogle didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its   new Google Home device. Pichai did say that ""Google Home was a   very popular present that many people opened on Christmas   morning,"" but that was as detailed as he got.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting   outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents   a real challenge for Google, because without control over the   hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means   all those potential voice searches will go to someone else.Pichai points out that it's the very early days for devices   such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over   Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. ""When   I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of   progress we have done in areas like natural language processing   comes into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To his credit,   Google Home has outperformed Alexain manyhead-to-head searchreviews.But smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and   Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and   services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of   overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It   just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with   Google Home last month.One area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon   Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of   Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for   Google Home to cross.But wait -- it gets tougherEven if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has   to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware   sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over   $90 billion in revenue last year.What's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because   its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a   Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31%   operating margin in the fourth quarter.If Google is going to make some real money off of voice   search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into   people's homes. Google's best idea so far is tofacilitate commerce through voice search. But if there's one company that has Google's number in   e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle   against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no   matter how good its search capabilities are.Not just a challenge -- a threatThe growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The   shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a   decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's   cash cow.Google is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in   smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It   plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But   as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away   from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to   continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for   its main desktop and mobile products.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Offers Up More Free Profits!;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you've read me for a while, you know that I have my concerns about the battle between the long-term prospects ofNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) versus the outrageous valuation of NFLX stock. My biggest worry is that eventually,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will severely pressure Netflix's P&L.makeArticleAd();But, for the short term, I think it's easier to trade Netflix's price action than it is the fundamentals.First, we have an uber-bullish equity market. Add to that the cult following in Netflix stock, and you have something that needs a big reason to break down. Unless we get a general market correction, we don't have an environment conducive to NFLX faltering in a big way.Click to EnlargeTechnically, I like the way NFLX stock is behaving. It's setting higher highs and knocking on roofs. It already blew through my recently set targets, but I don't think it's too late to squeeze out another bullish trade.I will submit that the fundamental argument over the value of NFLX stock is debatable. So I revert to the technical aspect. Recently I wrote abouthow to reap free profits from trading Netflix. That trade is still in play, but I feel like I need to skew my position to more long than short. So I can reset another trade to help me achieve just that.How to Trade NFLX Stock Right NowThe bet:Sell the NFLX Sep $100 put for $3.50 per contract. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 30% buffer from current price. My breakeven price is $96.5 per share.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionIf Netflix stays above $100 through September, then someone bought a losing lotto ticket from me and I get to keep the premium. If NFLX stock falls below $100 while the position is open, then I could be put the stock. I start to accrue losses below $96.50 per share.I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. In this case, and if I am assigned the stock at $100 per share, it would mean that I bought Netflix stock at a 30% discount from today's prices.Selling naked puts is not suitable for all risk profiles or account sizes. I could change the trade to being a sold put spread (also called a bull put spread) to better suit more traders.The alternate:Sell a NFLX Sep $100/$95 credit put spread for 75 cents per contract. But in this case, my max loss is finite, so margin required is fixed. The trade still has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 16% potential yield as a reward. NFLX would still need to fall 30% to reach my sold risk level.2 Ways to Trade Facebook Inc (FB) Stock After EarningsI did mention that NFLX is looking frisky from the technical perspective. So someone who wants to capture that potential can allocate some of the premium collected for selling the puts to buy a bullish call position. This can be done with a March debit call spread at $140 for a chance to double your money.Personally, I will opt out because I want to tradeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and AMZN. I don't want to be too heavy on the mega-cap tech.I am not required to hold any options positions open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Amazon Under Attack As Walmart Rolls Out Free Two-Day Shipping For Everyone;1/31/2017;"USA Todayhas some more detail on the move:Upping the ante in the shipping wars, Walmart is scrapping a     subscription program that gave members free two-day delivery in     order to make the service available to all of its customers     starting Tuesday.There's only one catch: shoppers must meet a minimum order   size requirement to qualify for free shipping:makeArticleAd();Walmart customers shopping for items ranging from pet food     to peanut butter will be able to get those items delivered to     their homes within two days at no extra cost for a minimum     purchase of $35. If they have the products delivered to a local     store, customers don't need to meet a spending threshold.Walmart had previously been testing a pilot program called   Shipping Pass, which cost $49 a year for unlimited free two-day   shipping. That service was clearly Walmart's answer to Amazon   Prime, which currently costs $10.99 a month for unlimited two-day   shipping, along with a large host of other benefits including   streaming video, music, and Prime-exclusive products.WMT has decided to do away with the program, however, and   instead roll out free shipping for everyone without a   subscription fee. Customers that signed up for Shipping Pass will   have their membership costs refunded.It'll be interesting to see if and how Amazon responds to the   change. It's unlikely the company will offer free two-day   shipping outside of its Prime model, as the company instead   offers free non-Prime five-day shipping on many of its items.Historically, AMZN prefers to add significant value to the   Prime service rather than compete on price. In that vein, perhaps   we'll see a corresponding announcement from CEO Jeff Bezos soon   about a new Prime account feature, because this announcement from   Walmart is certainly significant enough to warrant a strong   response.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)was trading at $822.25 per share on Tuesday morning, down $8.13   (-0.98%).

Will Amazon.com (AMZN) Disappoint this Earnings Season?;1/31/2017;"Amazon.comAMZNwill report fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Feb 2 after the bell.The company has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and anEarnings ESPof -2.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. We don't recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.Amazon's earnings surprise history hasn't been much impressive as the company missed estimates in two of the last four quarters.Over the last one year, the stock has however outperformed the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 44.46% compared with the industry's gain of 41.77%.What Happened in the Last Reported QuarterInternational/North America/AWS Mix:The North America segment accounted for around 58% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 6.8% and 25.8%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 7.8% sequentially and 28.3% year over year.  The AWS segment was up 12% sequentially and a massive 55% year over year with revenue share at nearly 10%.Prime:Amazon continued adding new features and benefits for Prime members.The company rolled out Prime exclusive original TV shows, movies and music streaming services. It introduced Twitch Prime (Prime benefits for gamers), Prime Reading (Prime exclusive free reading service), Audible Channels (free, unlimited short-form digital audio service) and added new features to Prime Photo service.Heavy investments:Amazon's third quarter earnings miss was primarily due to a spike in operating expenses mainly, which increased as a result of buildout of fulfillment centers in preparation for the holiday season. Costs also escalated due to the company's increased spending on original TV shows and movies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and India expansion-related expenses also resulted in higher spending.Guidance:Fourth quarter revenues are expected to include a 60 bps positive FX impact and come in around $42-45.5 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $1.25 billion.What We Are WatchingRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) strategy. Content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenue but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS:Amazon Web Services is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We are optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this to have added to its customer base.IoT:One area of potential growth is devices and IoT. It's probably not right to ignore the growing capabilities of Echo and Alexa in this regard and how they are being received by hardware partners.IoT devices/technologies are unlikely to have a very big impact on results right now (revenue contribution won't be material near term), but it could very well supplement the rest of the business by making it easier to buy from Amazon.Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon (AMZN) Film Division to Premiere Patriot on Feb 24;1/31/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Amazon.com Inc.'sAMZNfilm production division, Amazon Studios, has scheduled the premiere of its original one-hour series, Patriot, on Feb 24.For now, the series will be available for Prime members on Prime Video in the U.S., UK, Germany and Austria. Later this year, the show will be available on PrimeVideo.com for Prime Video members in more than 200 countries and territories.The series can be viewed via the Amazon Video app on TVs and connected devices like mobile, Fire TV, and online at Amazon.com/originals, at no additional cost to prime membership.Over the last one year, shares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 44.46% compared with the Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 41.77%.About the SeriesPatriot is based on the life story of intelligence officer John Tavner who makes efforts to prevent Iran from going nuclear. In the story, Tavner will forgo all safety nets and assume a mid-level employee at a Midwestern industrial piping firm to complete his mission. However, the federal government's incompetence and his own day job in an industrial piping company will put his mission in danger.The start cast includes Michael Dorman, Terry O'Quinn, Kurtwood Smith and Michael Chernus.The series will make its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival Berlinale. It has been executive produced by Steven Conrad, James Parriott, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, Charles Gogolak and Gil Bellows.Our TakeThe increasing popularity of tablets, smartphones and web-connected TVs has enhanced online-video viewing and continues to attract consumers as well as leading technology companies, like AlphabetGOOGLand Apple Inc.AAPL.Therefore, Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to boost its digital media sales and attract new viewers, by adding varied series and movies to its content lineup and making Prime Video more attractive.With intense competition in online video content, majors such as Netflix, Inc.NFLX, Hulu and HBO, are seeing substantial success. It is natural for Amazon to compete against them with successful acts of its own. These new shows are expected to help Amazon penetrate further into the growing streaming market, at a rapid pace.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc.

15 Best Short-Term Stock Investments;1/31/2017;"As any stock trader can tell you, the market can be volatile. That's why investment professionals typically recommend investors take a long-term approach to investing to reduce the risk of losing principal. If you invest at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of your money overnight, so keep in mind that stocks are not always the best short-term investments.That said, stock prices work both ways. A prudent — or lucky — investor could make a great deal of money just as rapidly as he could lose it. If you have a tolerance for risk and are willing to do the research, short-term trading might be a solution for at least part of your portfolio.If you decide to go this route, don't hesitate to contact a financial professional if you need assistance. Most important, if you're looking for stocks to buy now, do your homework to find good ones in which to invest. You can begin here with this list of 15 stocks to buy that might be thebest short-term investments for your portfolio.makeArticleAd();1. Apple:AAPLApple is one of the best-known companies in America, thanks in no small part to the iPhone. It's also the largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization — the value of a company that's traded on the stock market — a number you can calculate by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of its outstanding shares. In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.Apple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.2. Gilead Sciences:GILDIf you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.Gilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.3. Alphabet:GOOGAlphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.Given the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.4. Facebook:FBEven if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to ""like"" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users — and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.Facebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.5. Citigroup:CCitigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. TheFederal Reserve raised interest ratesfor just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.Citigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year — and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.6. IBM:IBMIBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.The company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent — both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human ""Jeopardy!"" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.7. Norwegian Cruise Line:NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.Norwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017 — the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.8. Amazon:AMZNAmazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually — more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined — according to analysts at Cowen Group.Amazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.9. Restoration Hardware:RHRestoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.In addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply ""RH."" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.10. Toll Brothers:TOLToll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.Some concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.11. Deutsche Telekom:DTEGYDeutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile — and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers — it fell by 13 percent in 2016 — even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.A takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.12. Sprouts Farmers Market:SFMSprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment — and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.The company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.13. Delta Air Lines:DALDelta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.Delta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine — it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.14. Novartis:NVTSAnother value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.Part of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.15. General Motors:GMGeneral Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over themovement to electric vehicleshave held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors — like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times — trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.GM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.Data is accurate as of Jan. 25, 2017.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven ifApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest company in the world (as measured by market cap), its quarterly earnings reports would still arguably be the most-watched reports for any given earnings seasons. Not only are a wide swath of many other companies linked to Apple's success, but AAPL stock itself is something of a barometer for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterly earnings announcements have also raised questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania has run its course. The growth pace has been undeniably tapering off.That's going to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Apple earnings report for its fiscal first quarter is due.Apple Earnings PreviewAs of the most recent look, Apple isexpected to post earnings of $3.22 per shareon revenue of $77.42 billion for the quarter ending in December. The company itself had guided for Q1 revenue of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock reported for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year's first fiscal quarter tally of $75.87 billion.Apple needs a strong showing on Tuesday. Although it has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basis in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAAPL stock investors have been patient thus far, giving CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a maturing market. A shortfall and/or another quarter of shrinking numbers, however, may push those traders' patience over the edge.3 Things to Watch for AAPLNot that Apple doesn't have a myriad of things going on at any given time, but for the most part, investors tend to focus on what they perceive as the biggest three. The three items that will be doing most of the driving for AAPL stock after Tuesday's report are (in no particular order)…iPhone 7 salesIt's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sales of the company's flagship device can cure all other ills, but if sales of the company's most recent iteration of the iPhone fall short, little else matters.Expectations are widely varied on this front too. Cowen & Co.thinks Apple sold 58.5 million units of the iPhone 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believes Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhone 7 - during its fiscal Q1. The overall consensus, though, isan average of 77.3 million units. Presumably most of those are the 7 and 7 Plus models.Apps and Digital ContentWhile Apple used to be a hardware company that also happened to facilitate the purchase of smartphone apps, music and video media, digital content is increasingly becomingan important part of the revenue mixas saturation becomes a real issue.The company doesn't offer much in the way of expectations for how its revenue breaks down, but we do know that in the previous quarter, Apple enjoyed revenue of $6.3 billion for its ""Services"" division, which is mostly made up of its video, audio and apps arms. That was a 24% year-over-year improvement. That makes it thesecond-biggest category of product for Apple, though it's still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?AAPL is even mulling the creation ofits own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remains to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discussed within the Apple earnings report and conference call. Maybe it won't come up at all, but there's no denying AAPL is one of the more vulnerable companies to President Donald Trump's policy plans.Not only might a strict foreign worker and immigration policy limit Apple's access to technical talent, but much-discussed tariffs on Chinese-made imports could start a trade war that leaves Apple right in the middle of it. Not only does Apple sell products to Chinese consumers, it relies on China to make many of the iPhone's key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trailing P/E of 14.5, Apple shares are priced fairly … maybe even undervalued. That's apt to be a large part of the reason the pros are collectively rating AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (leaning toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspicious in light of the lackluster results we've seen for the prior three quarters. Apple is going to have to outperform most expectations if the stock's to build any further on the 34% gain it has mustered since May of last year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThe post3 Things Apple Inc.

3 Reasons Amazon.com Is Taking Over the World;1/30/2017;"If you're wondering what the best stock of the past 20 years   is, there's a far-and-away winner.Image source: The Motley FoolmakeArticleAd();According to data from YCharts,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has increased more than 42,000% since its   IPO 20 years ago, in May 1997.AMZNdata byYChartsIn other words, $1,000 invested at that time would today be   worth more than $420,000. Amazon's market value at the time of   the IPO, which was $300 million, has grown by more than 1,000   times as the company is now worth nearly $400 billion. Share   dilution has made the increase in the individual share value   less.What's amazing about Amazon is that even as it's become one of   the five most valuable companies in the country, the company   continues to grow at a breakneck rate. Analysts are expecting   revenue to have increased 28% in 2016 when the company reports   full-year earnings on Feb. 2, and for earnings per share to have   grown nearly fourfold from a year ago, thanks to blockbuster   growth at its cloud computing division.With that kind of momentum and the popularity of programs like   its Prime membership service, it seems likely that Amazon will   become the most valuable company in the world in the next decade.   Here are three reasons for that outlook.Invent, invent, inventNo company has put a greater emphasis on invention in the past   two decades. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has credited the company'   success on the three big ideas: Put the customer first. Invent.   And be patient.Amazon has been at the forefront of a vast range of emerging   industries since its inception, including e-commerce, e-readers   and e-books, cloud computing, video streaming, digital technology   such as Alexa, and even drone delivery.Amazon's culture encourages invention, risk-taking and   failure, and that culture seems to be the biggest driver of its   success. The company's recent opening of its Amazon Go store   offers a perfect example. Using a network of cameras and other   advanced technologies similar to self-driving cars, the   convenience allows customers to select items and simply walk out   of the store with them. There is no checkout process. Amazon just   charges customers automatically through a smartphone app. The   company spent four years working on the technology, and its   willingness to make those kinds of sacrifices have enabled it to   gain such market power. The company's emphasis on making things   easier for the customer and developing new technologies is what's   made it such a powerful disruptor across so many industries.Cutthroat competitivenessA more-hidden aspect of Amazon's unique culture may be the   company's extreme competitiveness. Bezos has repeatedly issued   broadsides to rivals such as ""Your margin is my opportunity"" and   operated with breakeven margins for 20 years as the company built   out scale. While most businesses seek out profits to satisfy   shareholders, Bezos has always been content to play the long   game, promising investors from day one that he was building a   company for the long term, and it's paid off.A much-read 2015New York Timesexpose described Amazon as a brutal workplace where much is   demanded of employees whose ideas are sternly challenged and even   belittled. But even the harsh workplace environment may   contribute to the company's strength.The company has often elbowed out smaller competitors by using   monopolistic tactics. When Quidsi's Diapers.com began taking   significant market share from Amazon, the e-commerce leader   responded by lowering diaper prices by a third, bleeding Quidsi   until it sold itself to Amazon.In book publishing, Amazon got involved in a lawsuit when it   refused to abide by a publisher's prices, with the publisher   insisting the prices were necessary to give authors adequate   incentive and keep the industry alive and profitable. Amazon   wanted to charge $10 for most e-books and went as far as   essentially refusing to sell 5,000 titles from Hachette, delaying   shipments by weeks for no reason other than to punish the   publisher for not cooperating. Amazon eventually caved in to the   publishing houses, agreeing to their pricing model, but it still   maintains monopoly-like control over the bookselling   industry.Competitive advantagesComplementing Amazon's inventiveness and its   ultra-competitveness is the company's network of competitive   advantages. Amazon has a built a reputation as a low-cost   provider, although recent studies have shown that the company is   most competitive on price on only the most popular products.Regardless, Amazon has gained the trust of many of its   customers, especially Prime members who go directly to Amazon   when they need to order something online. Prime has encouraged   Amazon shoppers to spend double what they used to on the website   and encouraged members to participate in other parts of Amazon's   ecosystem, such as video streaming and Kindle books.But not all of Amazon's competitive advantages are   customer-facing. The company's Marketplace and Fulfillment by   Amazon have made the website the most popular home for   third-party vendors. That adds another revenue stream for Amazon   and in turn makes it the more appealing for customers as it   increases its product range.Finally, Amazon's reputation with customers allows it to   easily enter new industries as it did when it launched Home   Services, offering services such as house cleaning or furniture   assembly through third-party vendors.As Amazon continues to build out new fulfillment centers and   unveil technologies like Amazon Go and Alexa, its competitive   advantages are likely to increase. Considering the vast majority   of retail spending still takes place off line, Amazon has a long   growth path ahead.Expect the company to keep disrupting industries far and wide   over the next decade as it continues its quest to take over the   world.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

New Technologies, Automation And The Future;1/30/2017;"ByElliott R. Morss:New Technologies, Automation and the FutureElliott R. Morss© All Rights ReservedIntroductionmakeArticleAd();In recent postings, I havejoinedmany others in speculating on what effects the information revolution will have. Already, its impact has been tremendous. Its effects include:The elimination of a huge number of jobs lost in both service and production industries;Social media has completely transformed the manner in which we interact/communicate;Online shopping is growing rapidly, andDigital communication has resulted in an acceleration of technological discoveries.So what is coming? Since 2002, the McKinsey Global Institute ((MGI)) has been tracking changes resulting from the information revolution. This is needed because many politicians have little idea of what is happening. For example, Trump says he will bring back jobs by taxing imports. This will hardly solve the problem. A recentMGI studyconcluded:""Trade and outsourcing explain only about 20 percent of the 5.8 million manufacturing jobs lost during the 2000-10 period; more than two-thirds of job losses can be attributed to continued productivity growth, which has been outpacing demand growth for the past decade.""In itsmost recent study, MGI attempted to determine the labor force implications of technological developments. In what follows, I summarize its methodology and conclusions along with my own commentary.MethodologyMGI used the state of technology in respect to 18 performance capabilities to estimate the technical automation potential of more than 2,000 work activities from more than 800 occupations across the US economy, and then broadened our analysis across the global economy.ResultsMGI started by developing seven categories of ""automatable"" human activities. Table 1 provides its estimates of automatable shares for each category. While 81% of ""predictable physical"" can be automated by adapting currently available technologies, MGI estimates that only 9% of ""managing"" is automatable. The third column is the category's share of the US automatable total. MGI has concluded that the categories most susceptible for automation are ""predictable physical"" and the ""collecting and processing of data."" Together, these three activities constitute 51% of total employment and $2.7 trillion in wages.Table 1 - US: Time Spent on Automatable ActivitiesSource: McKinsey Global Institute,A Future That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityMGI then looked at the automation potential for more than 2,000 work activities. It reduced this down to 19 industrial sectors for the US economy. It then broadened the analysis to the global economy. The results from this exercise are summarized in Table 2.Table 2 - Automation Potential for 19 SectorsSource: McKinsey Global Institute,A Future That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityOf course, it is easy to second-guess MGI's estimates. For example, I believe a far greater share of educational activities than 27% can be automated. Why? Because a good deal of education occurs via lectures, and definitely there are better and worse lecturers. In light of this, why not get the best lectures on all topics and provide them digitally to classrooms? Classroom teachers would then only have to discuss and answer questions on the lectures. Of course, such an action would be vigorously resisted by the teachers' unions.And to that point, MGI argues there are five key factors that will influence the pace and extent of automation:Technical feasibility, since the technology has to be invented, integrated and adapted;The cost of developing and deploying solutions, which affects the business case for adoption;Labor market dynamics, including the supply, demand, and costs of human labor as an alternative to automation (see education discussion above);The economic benefits, which could include higher throughput and increased quality, as well as labor cost savings.Regulatory and social acceptance will affect the rate of adoption even when deployment makes business sense.MGI believes that when all of these factors into account, it will take decades for automation's effect on current work activities to play out fully.Demographics, Productivity Growth and Labor Force AdjustmentsOver the last four decades, productivity gains have been labor-saving. In fact, these gains have wiped out a huge number of middle class jobs. However, if we look out over a longer time frame, the picture is somewhat different. Economic growth is constrained by the labor supply and its productivity. We know that for most developed countries, populations and as a consequence, labor supplies are falling. That means that economic growth depends exclusively on productivity growth. For most developing countries, economic growth will benefit from both rising population and growing productivity. MGI points out:""…peak employment will occur in most countries within 50 years. The expected decline in the share of the working-age population will open an economic growth gap: roughly half of the sources of economic growth from the past half century (employment growth) will evaporate as populations age. Even at historical rates of productivity growth, economic growth could be nearly halved. Automation could compensate for at least some of these demographic trends. We estimate the productivity injection it could give to the global economy as being between 0.8 and 1.4 percent of global GDP annually, assuming that human labor replaced by automation would rejoin the workforce and be as productive as it was in 2014. Considering the labor substitution effect alone, we calculate that, by 2065, automation could potentially add productivity growth in the largest economies in the world (G19 plus Nigeria) that is the equivalent of an additional 1.1 billion to 2.3 billion full-time workers.""Table 3 provides MGI's estimates of the full-time equivalent (FTE) GDP gap in 2065 of assuming today's productivity and current population projections and today's GDP/FTE. So, for example, the US GDP/FTE would be 4% less than it is now because of the labor force decline. MGI concludes for developed nations:""Automation can provide the productivity boost required to meet economic growth projections that they otherwise would struggle to attain without other significant productivity growth accelerators. These economies thus have a major interest in pursuing rapid automation adoption.""Table 3 - FTE Gap Between FTE Projections and Number of FTEs Needed to Maintain GDP per Capita as Percent FTEs in 2014Source: McKinsey Global Institute,A Future That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityWhile this is an interesting exercise, I remain far more concerned about labor supply surpluses, resulting from accelerating labor-saving automation than slower economic growth resulting from labor supply shortages.Investing - Who Produces Automation Equipment?Automation is clearly accelerating so it is reasonable to ask who the producers are. A list is provided in Table 4. Many of the companies have been around for a long time and getting into automation is an evolution from their main focus. Examples include Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Honda (HMC), Hyundai (HYMLF), Kawasaki (KWHIY), Lockheed (LMT), Samsung (SSNNF) and Toyota (TM). ""Purer"" automation plays include ABB Robotics (ABB), AeroVironment (AVAV), Fanuc (FANUY), iRobot (IRBT), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Swisslog (SLHGF) and Titan (TITXF). A relatively large number of these firms are Japanese.Table 4 - Leading Automation ""Producers""Source:Robotics Business ReviewI answer this with a quote from Peter Lynch. Peter Lynch's track record was truly remarkable. As I havenoted elsewhere, he beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 12 of the 14 years he ran Fidelity's Magellan Fund (FMAGX). And on average, if the S&P gained 5%, Magellan gained 22.5%! Even in the two years the S&P outperformed Lynch, the spread was very small. Lynch argues you should:""Use your specialized knowledge to home in on stocks you can analyze, study them and then decide if they're worth owning. The best way to invest is to look at companies competing in the field where you work.""With rapid technological change, the automation business is inherently risky. And I don't work in the industry.ConclusionsIt is hard to keep in mind just how rapidly technologies are changing. And that, coupled with how long it takes people to adapt, makes the future very uncertain. Most people are quite slow in adapting to the new technologies - just look at how long it has taken buying online to become significant. There are reasons to be tremendously optimistic in the fields of health and energy. But dealing with jobs lost to automation remains a real problem.See alsoIf You Don't Understand This, You Don't Understand Macroon seekingalpha.com"
Is the Bar Higher for the Q4 Earnings Season?;1/30/2017;"Even as Earnings growth appears to have improved notably relative to the last couple of years, positive surprises appear hard to come to by. This becomes evident from looking at the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates in the ongoing Q4 earnings season. You can see that in the comparison chart below that compares the proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies reported in the preceding quarter, as well as the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages.With results from 171 S&P 500 index members already out or 34.1% of the index's total membership, positive surprises are tracking below historical periods, particularly with respect to EPS surprises. If we see this trend continue in the coming days as the rest of Q4 reports come in, then it would mean that estimates likely hadn't dropped enough ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher this time around relative to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 171 S&P 500 members that have reported as of January 30th. Total earnings for these 171 index members are up +6% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% beating revenue estimates. We discussed earlier how the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates has been tracking below historical periods. But we don't have that issue on the growth front, with both earnings and revenue growth tracking above other historical periods for the same group of 171 index members.The chart below shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rate for these 171 companies compare with other recent periods.The Finance sector is a big contributor to the aggregate growth picture at this stage. For the Finance sector, we now have Q4 results from 57.9% of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 67.5% beating EPS estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Finance sector from the results thus far, total earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 companies that have reported would be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues. This is still better growth than we have seen from the same group of ex-Finance S&P 500 members, as the comparison chart below shows.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 171 index members that have reported results with estimates from the still-to-come 329 companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 earnings growth drops to +1% on +4.2% higher revenues.For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.Apple(AAPL), which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the sector's total earnings, is expected to report -7.8% lower earnings on +0.4% higher revenues as it comes out with its quarterly results after the close on Tuesday January 31st. Excluding the Apple drag, total Q4 earnings for the rest of the Tech sector would be up +11.4% on +5.5% higher revenues.Facebook(FB), which reports after the market's close on Wednesday February 1st, doesn't carry as much weight in the sector as the iPhone maker. But Facebook's Q4 earnings are expected to be up +91% from the same period last year on +44.5% higher revenues.Amazon(AMZN) isn't technically a Technology stock (it's a retailer), but it is also expected to show strong growth in its quarterly report that comes out after the close on Thursday February 2nd.Looking beyond Q4, the growth pace is expected to ramp up notably in the current and following quarters, as the chart below shows.As you can see, total 2017 Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +8.7% from the same period last year. The chart below shows Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last few weeks.It is not unusual for 2017 Q1 estimates to be coming down at this stage of the 2016 Q4 reporting cycle, but a lot will depend on the pace and magnitude of these negative revisions in the coming days. At this stage, Q1 estimates aren't falling by as much as has historically been the case. This should add to confidence in market expectations for the following quarters when growth is expected to really ramp up.Note: Note: Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Tanks as Walgreens Deal Price Dips;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) took a beating Monday morning afterWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NASDAQ:WBA) announced it would cut how much it's paying to acquire the drug store chain to between $6.50 and $7 per share of RAD stock. Rite Aid shares were down more than 16% in response.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBoth WBA and RAD today agreed to the sale of 200 more stores (that's on top of the original 1,000 planned store sales), which directly affects theper-share price of the deal.If 1,000 or fewer stores are sold off, then WBA will pay $7 per share of RAD stock; while 1,200 store divestitures will lower the per-share value to $6.50.The original agreement for the merger valued Rite Aid at $9.4 billion, or $9 per share. Today's price values RAD at roughly $7.1 billion - a steep decline.What's more, the pharma retailers have pushed the deadline for the deal from Jan. 27 to July 31.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs had   notable inflows »"
Plenty of Grist for the Market Mill This Week;1/30/2017;"Monday, January 30, 2017makeArticleAd();Plenty of grist for the mill of the markets this week, including Personal Income & Spending today, news from the Bank of Japan's policy meeting tomorrow, news from the latest Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, and, of course, the heart of Q4 earnings season. For a comprehensive account of these and many more events this week, check out Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank's latest Global Market Ahead:4 Good Reasons to Focus on the USAPersonal Income & Spending showed a gap of 2 percentage points: income grew 0.3% in December (analysts had expected 0.4%) while spending ran hotter at 0.5%. Income in November was revised from unchanged to +0.1%. Because we're talking about fractions of percentage points, none of this is extremely ""newsy"" at the moment, although in aggregate over time we may see some patterns emerging, and of course we'd prefer to see incomes rise as much as spending, if possible.No big names are reporting earnings until ExxonMobilXOMTuesday morning and AppleAAPLafter the bell tomorrow, although we will hear from a couple Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) companies like BofI HoldingBOFIand Heritage OaksHEOP. Other big firms like FacebookFBand AmazonAMZNwill report later in the week.It will be interesting to see how the market interprets - if it decides to interpret - events developing out of the White House over the weekend, including an executive order from President Trump to ban Muslim citizens from the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Trump Rally had been priced for perfection, after all, and abrupt actions such as these often have a way of seeing the markets hit the brakes a bit.Of course, the market may instead simply focus on the here and now: the proposed tax cuts and deregulation should still provide a windfall for publicly traded companies, if not in the immediate term then sometime down the road. But the divisiveness that appears to be promoted by President Trump may add a new wrinkle into the proceedings.

Will It Continue?Corporate earnings have started growing again, with growth in the ongoing Q4 earnings season on track to reach its highest level in 8 quarters. Growth is still modest - the Q4 earnings growth is currently on track to reach +5.2% and the final growth tally for the quarter will at best be a couple of percentage points higher. But this is still a notable improvement over what we were experiencing in the recent past.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are tracking below other historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more 400 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 106 S&P 500 members.Q4 Scorecard(as of January 27, 2017)We have crossed the one-third mark in the Q4 reporting cycle, with results from 170 S&P 500 members, or 33.9% of the index's total membership, already out. Total earnings for these 170 index members are up +6.0% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.1% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 170 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises are tracking on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings front. The 64.1% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81.2% in the preceding quarter, 76.3% as the 4-quarter average and 72.2% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results include the Finance, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 57.7% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with +66.7% beating EPS estimates and +46.2% beating top-line estimates.This is a better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 59.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 82.8% beating revenue estimates.We will see what this week'sApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) reports bring, but the sector's Q4 earnings and revenue growth is about in-line with what we saw from this same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter (2016 Q3), though it is notably tracking above the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages. With respect to positive surprises, Tech companies appear to be beating EPS estimates at a lower proportion than has historically been the case, though the proportion of positive earnings surprises remains above the index level. Revenue surprises, on the other hand, are tracking notably above historical periods.Key Reports for the Week of January 30thTuesday - 1/31/2017: Monday has a relatively light reporting docket, but Tuesday is very busy with more than 90 companies reporting results, including 33 S&P 500 members (of which 22 are in the morning). The focus will be on Apple, which reports after the market's close.Exxon(NYSE:XOM-Free Report) will be a key report in the morning.Apple is expected to report $3.22 in earnings on $76.2 billion in revenues, which compare to $3.28 on $75.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock is up +9.7% since November 8th vs. +7% for the S&P 500 index and +6.1% for the Zacks Technology sector. December quarter estimates have been stable in recent days, though they have come down for the March quarter.Wednesday - 2/01/2017: Facebook is the most high profile of the 27 index members reporting results today (it will report after the market's close). The focus will be on the social media giant's ad revenues and daily active users, but the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $8.4 billion in revenues. This compares to EPS of $0.59 on $5.8 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have modestly inched up in recent days. The stock has performed in-line with the Zacks Tech sector since November 8th, up +6.3% vs. +6.1%.Thursday - 2/02/2017: On a busy reporting day with 35 index members coming out with Q4 results (23 in the morning & 12 after the market's close), the most notable report is fromAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) in the evening.Amazon is expected to report $1.41 in earnings (up +41.5% year over year) on $44.8 billion in revenues (up +25.4% in revenues). Estimates have come down ahead of the earnings report, but Amazon has never really been an EPS story; it is all top-line growth, particularly gains in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Amazon has staked a well-regarded claim to leadership in the fast-growing cloud business. The stock has been a strong performer over the past year, up +31.4% vs. +12.4% gain for the Zacks Retail sector.Note:Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Intel;1/30/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 30, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This QuarterAnalysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report). Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report); networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pulling back this morning, as President Donald Trump's travel ban on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries cast doubts on further economic policies. The uncertainty has placed theDow Jones Industrial Average'stentative hold on 20,000 in question amid a flood of key corporate earnings this week.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.3%, whileS&P 500futures have dropped 0.34% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.35%.On the options front, volume arrived below average on Friday, as about 14.4 million calls and 13.6 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, puts gained traction ahead of the weekend, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to a one-month high of 0.73, forcing the 10-day moving average to tick higher to 0.66.Turning to Friday's volume leaders, earnings was the major driver for several large tech names on the top ten most active options listing.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reports after the close tomorrow afternoon, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will step into the limelight after the close on Wednesday. Finally, online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) joins the fray after the close on Thursday.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock saw a wellspring of call option activity on Friday at a time when many traders were seeking protection ahead of the weekend. Total volume on the stock rose to 755,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an impressive 71% of the day's take.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Call buying was the order of the day, as traders appear to be anticipating a post-earnings rally from Facebook this Wednesday.Following Friday's close, the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio slipped from 0.82 at the beginning of the session to 0.75 as calls were added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by Facebook's quarterly report - implying rising expectations for a bullish post-earnings move. Implieds are still pricing in a move of about 5.3% for FB stock, with the upper bound lying at roughly $139.50 and the lower bound resting at $125.50.For the record, Facebook earnings are expected to rise nearly 66% to $1.31 per share, with sales soaring 45.4% to $8.49 billion. According toEarningsWhispers.com, the whisper number for Facebook's fourth-quarter comes in at $1.37 per share.Apple Inc (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is also on tap to release its quarterly report this week. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of about 2% for Apple earnings, down to $3.22 per share from $3.28 per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to creep 2% higher to $77.38 billion.Even speculative analysts remain reserved on Apple, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of only $3.23 per share. That said, iPhone unit sales and guidance amid the current geopolitical climate could be the major drivers for any post-earnings reaction for AAPL stock.As such, options traders appear to be playing it close to the vest on AAPL. Friday's activity revealed a bit of trepidation, with calls accounting for a below-average 58% of the 637,000 contracts traded on Apple stock. The 3 Feb. options series also shows a bit of concern for AAPL's earnings reaction, with the put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.74, slightly above Apple's historic pre-earnings range nearer 0.70. Furthermore, peak 3 Feb. call OI rests at the in-the-money $120 strike, hinting at low expectations for AAPL stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Last, but certainly not least, Amazon.com will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday, and it looks like evenI underestimated AMZN stock's potential. Several retailers have already reported this quarter, blaming lower-than-expected sales figures on slowing foot traffic, mainly due to the rising dominance of online shopping - a market in which Amazon commands38% of the market share.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsStill, AMNZ options traders appeared reluctant to jump on the bullish bandwagon on Friday. Total volume rose to 247,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 58% of the day's take.That said, peak call OI for the 3 Feb series totals 1,300 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $900 strike, with another 1,200 contracts at the $870 strike. So, while volume remains a touch conservative, AMZN options traders still appear to have high expectations for a post-earnings rally.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc.

While the company reported a strong earnings beat, Facebook CFO warned about a slowdown in revenue growth for Q4, and said ad load might ""come down meaningfully"" in the second half of this year.The news sparked a selloff from which Facebook wouldn't really recover until the start of 2017. But recover it has - FB stock is up roughly 15% in the past month to trade near all-time highs around $113.So, what's in store for Facebook this time around?If you believe Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sitting on the powder keg that sends Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believes Instagram and mobile ad revenues will drive the business forward, and expects Q4 revenues to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightly ahead of Wall Street's broader estimates for $8.5 billion. He also projects GAAP profits of $1.05, which are a penny higher than the consensus mark.""We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad units like DPAs, and Live video,"" says Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target represents 33% upside from here. ""While expense growth is a potential concern, FB has a history of under-promising and overdelivering in this area.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIndeed, mobile is king for Facebook, which crossed the 1 billion mark for ""mobile only"" active users in Q3. In fact, 84% of the company's $6.82 billion in ad revenues came from mobile - up from 78% in the year-ago period. At about $5.7 billion, mobile ad sales came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sales in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook matches Wall Street's projections for 45.6% sales growth, that would be down both sequentially from Q3's 59% revenue expansion, and last Q4's 52% increase in sales. Which means investors will be looking for other areas of growth.They could get it in Facebook Live, the company's somewhat controversial live streaming service that has unwittingly exposed users to real-time torture and suicide videos. Still, CEO believes images and video are the future of Facebook - and the expansion and advertising of Live's services reflect that plenty.Facebook will need to show Wall Street something exciting, though, or FB could be in for its second straight quarterly tumble.Facebook shares reached all-time highs just above $133 in late October. They then dropped but rebounded to the $132 area, but were rejected following the Q3 earnings report. FB then was sent packing to the $114 level, which it fought several times before rebounding into the current rally.Now, Facebook stock finds itself challenging the $132-$133 area once more, but this time with an overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading in the low 70s.And from a fundamental perspective, Facebook's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't nearly on par with the likes of pricey Big Tech stocks such asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but it's still a little lofty.At the very least, it'll be on investors' minds - especially if Facebook lays an egg Wednesday.More Earnings in FocusApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jan. 31:When Apple reports fiscal Q1 earnings this Tuesday, Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to finally snap its short streak of consecutive revenue declines with a small 2% uptick in sales. Earnings, however, are expected to shrink slightly, by about 2% to $3.22 per share. Naturally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be in focus - Q1 covers the holiday season, which typically accounts for the year's biggest chunk of the iPhone revenue pie.However, Macquarie Capital's Ben Schachter thinks Services - which includes the App Store and AppleCare -might be the star of this show:""The oft underestimated and misunderstood Services segment has the potential to drive ~100 bps [=1%] of overall gross margin expansion per year for Apple. However, if one believes that iPhone units can grow with iPhone 8 and then be roughly stable going forward, we believe Services and Apps will become the growth engine for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Feb. 2:Amazon, on the other hand, is expected to keep up its torrid growth numbers when it reports Q4 earnings on Thursday. Profits are expected to improve by 35% to $1.35 per share, while revenues should surge 25% to $44.67 billion. Numerous brick-and-mortar retailers reported difficult holiday seasons, hinting at more gains for the ubiquitous e-tailer.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsAlso promising is a note from Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who says Prime has ""maintained healthy growth."" He pointed toward a Cowen survey suggesting that Amazon Prime's customer base has grown 22% year-over-year to 50 million. Keep an eye on Amazon Web Services, however, as AMZN's cloud-based profit generator is having to contend with an increasingly aggressive Microsoft Corp.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Reclaim Its Throne;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has its day of reckoning fast approaching. Tim Cook has turned out to be a game manager for AAPL stock. That's not a slight against him, but a game manager comes in when your first-string QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Apple needs a visionary. There's no replacing Steve Jobs, and being a game manager in a sector that moves like lightning is not what the company needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock generates almost 70% of revenue from the iPhone, and that product is seeing increasing competition.The good news is that Apple has well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can literally do anything it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck overseas - although that may change under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Apple would probably have to make acquisitions in rapidly growing companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can venture into, one that I've been saying it must get into: original content.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018News has surfaced that AAPL is finally looking seriously at creating original TV and film content. For years, Apple has begged off of this direction. It seemed content to play around with music streaming, and licensing content from other providers for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions. In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary. Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.""The apple is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a very big way. We've seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has shifted its model toward original programming and is producing really great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTube Red, though, is kind of floundering right now.One thing people want is not only more content, but good content. Because Apple is so flush with cash, it can literally do anything in this arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so many models to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Apple would want to create high quality TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issue of streaming content alone. If Apple wanted, it could produce feature films, and buy out any of the existing movie theatre chains and rebrand it as an Apple Theatre experience, and drop in all manner of synergies like this.The concept of the ""long tail"" is still very much in play, so creating independent work for a price, or returning to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mining new talent from film schools and user-generated genius that's all over the place.The emerging technology of VR is another place to stretch. The ability to curate fully engaging experiences via VR, and developing technology that allows players to wear bodysuits permitting them to actually experience touch in these games is the next frontier.Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?And Apple has the money for it. It could become a multi-platform creator of content, and be able to engage people from all over the world.Is this is a blockbuster revenue generator for Apple stock? It's way too early to tell. However, having a vision that extends the concept of ""content"" to things like VR and more ""experiential"" content, could mean becoming the first mover in a whole new generation of entertainment. That is priceless.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned.

How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After Earnings;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is scheduled to report its latest batch of earnings on Thursday, Feb. 2, after the close of trading. Looked at through a multimonth lens, AMZN stock has largely done nothing since last October, though it has seen some gyrations within this time frame.makeArticleAd();To be better prepared for Amazon earnings, and for perspective, here is my battle plan for AMZN following the report.Like I always say, ""gambling"" on a stock through its earnings announcement in hopes of a certain outcome (a rally or a selloff) is on average a low-probability bet. Even in the best-case scenario, this has a 50/50 chance of success.Regardless of how good or bad a company's outlook, earnings, sales or other metric is, the immediate- to near-term direction of any given stock following earnings ultimately depends on what large investors want to do with shares after the report. This might sound oversimplistic, but I find that many active investors often lose sight of the fact that above all, it's supply and demand that dictates price direction. And supply and demand don't always correlate rationally with news flow.AMZN Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear weekly chart of Amazon, we see that the latest steep rally since early 2015 has largely taken place within a well-defined up-trending channel similar to what we see in in other large-cap technology growth stocks such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB).Click to EnlargeNote how well the yellow 50-week simple moving average has held as support over the past couple of years and how this has coincided with the lower end of the up-trending channel.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFrom this perspective, considering that AMZN stock tends to make big moves following its earnings reports, shares this week might either gravitate toward the upper end of the up-trending channel (toward $900) or retest the lower end of the channel around the low to mid-$700s.That might not sound like much insight. However, it gives us a very well-defined trading range between $750 and $900.All else being equal, a rally to the upper end of the range would be a better opportunity to sell or short the stock. A move to the lower end may provide better buying opportunities, following a bullish reversal.Lastly, note the negative divergence between price and momentum over the past 12 months. The price of AMZN stock has continued to rise, yet momentum - as represented by the MACD oscillator at the bottom of the chart - is still pointing lower and making lower highs. This does not bode well for much further upside in the stock, and even a post-earnings rally may be better sold than chased higher.Here's Why Netflix, Inc. Stock (NFLX) Will Trade At $270 By 2020On the daily chart, we see that the latest multiweek rally in AMZN, after bouncing off the 200-day moving average (red) in early January, once again has the stock back at its October 2016 highs near $840.Click to EnlargeActive traders could look to buy/chase AMZN stock higher if and when the stock can break and hold above $850 on a daily closing basis following the earnings report. From there, a next upside target becomes the aforementioned upper end of the trading channel around the $900 mark. Any sudden bearish reversal would be used as a stop-loss signal.Alternatively, if AMZN stock gaps lower and sells off following the earnings report, a next downside target in the mid-$750s comes into focus.Like what you see?

Here’s Why Netflix, Inc. Stock (NFLX) Will Trade At $270 By 2020;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNetflix, Inc.(NFLX) stock continued its steady ride upward on Friday following another price target increase. The streaming giant has certainly had its share of target increases since itslast earnings reportand huge subscriber add surprise.makeArticleAd();But will it continue to soar? Analysts aren't ready to say no just yet.Netflix Stock Target: $175 Per Share…For NowIn a research note dated Jan. 27,MKM Partnersanalyst Rob Sanderson bumped up his price target for Netflix stock by $10 to $175 per share. While he hasn't changed his view of the domestic opportunity for the company, he does feel that the opportunity in international markets is bigger than he had thought before. Now he's looking for higher subscriber numbers and positive contributions from overseas markets.The analyst doesn't believe that Netflix stock is fully valued yet. In fact, he sees more than $12 per share in earnings power potential by 2021 and believes that the streaming company will remain in ""rapid growth mode for subscribers.""He also expects Netflix stock to trade at $270 per share by 2020, marking a multiple of 20 to 25 times forward earnings per share.Netflix's Content TravelsOne of the factors in Sanderson's view is that the content Netflix has been buying seems to travel outside the U.S. He notes that the company is no longer sending Hollywood-produced content overseas but rather regional content. The company's original shows are proving to be big draws for subscribers, especially as the company expands into new regions.He's now expecting Netflix's international subscribers to rise to 115 million over the next five years. This would mark a 22% penetration rate for broadband homes, including 28% of broadband homes in developed economies and 14% in developing markets. Previous international markets reached that level around five years after Netflix launched in them, he said.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksHe pegs Wave-1 developed economies' aggregate penetration for Netflix at about 30% of broadband homes and Latin America's penetration at greater than 14%.Is NFLX a Cult or Growth Stock?With analysts from most firms so massively bullish on Netflix stock, it's no wonder investors have been carrying it onward and upward. CNBC's Jim Cramer called the stock a cult stock in 2015, but is that the case anymore? In a post forThe Motley Foolearlier this week, Leo Sun argued against that label's accuracy, saying that he now believes Netflix stock to be a growth stock.He says that while the stock does look rather expensive compared to the company's trailing 12-month earnings, its bottom line growth is stabilizing and suggests that it's not all that expensive relative to the company's future earnings growth potential. And this is the basis of most analysts' arguments.The rapid growth of Netflix's subscriber base suggests that it does have a bright future and may indeed still be in growth mode…http://investorplace.com/2017/01/netflix-inc-stock-will-trade-at-270-by-2020-analyst/2/Bearsare convinced that the company has no future and is burning cash too rapidly on content that won't keep subscribers paying their monthly fees. The company's history of producing content that travels bodes well for its future, but at some point, it will have to stop burning so much cash, or investors will get tired of waiting.Just look atAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN), which had to take a breather from all the cash burn to get investors back on board. At the end of the day, Netflix's future probably hangs less on its ability to produce content that travels well and more on producing content that will stick around.Are series likeThe CrownandOrange is the New Blackshows that people will still be paying to watch in ten years, or will they have passed their expiration dates, requiring the company to keep feeding the monster more than it can afford to?Netflix stock rose by as much as 2.04% to $141.79 during regular trading hours on Friday.The postNetflix, Inc.

Slowly and   steadily, however, the company has increased what Alexa, the name   used to address the artificial intelligence (AI) voice assistant   in the device, can do.Echo and its sister product, Dot, now can serve as the base   that controls your home. Developers from hundreds, perhaps   thousands, of companies have been rolling out products that   integrate with Echo and countless more have been embedding Alexa   into their devices. In addition, the Amazon devices and their AI   ""brain"" were one of the big topics at January's Consumer   Electronics Show with Alexa-enabled or controllable devices being   very well represented.Amazon has jumped to a lead in the race to control the smart   home of the future, which, for some people, has become the smart   home of the present. What's hard to know, because the online   retailer does not share much, if any, data on devices sold, is   exactly how big the market for Echo has become.makeArticleAd();Amazon's Echo and the smaller Dot have the Alexa AI built in.   Image source: Amazon.How big is Echo?While Amazon does not share sales data, Consumer Intelligence   Research Partners (CIRP) has analyzed the company's user base and   come up with an estimate as to how many Echos have been sold. The   research firm said its analysis indicates that 8.2 million Amazon   customers in the United States have purchased an Echo device   since its late-2014 introduction.CIRP also found that awareness of the Echo has risen   dramatically among the online retailer's customers. The research   company estimates that among U.S. Amazon customers, awareness of   the devices increased to 82% as of Dec. 31, 2016, up from 47% a   year before that and 20% on March 31, 2015 (the first quarter   after its introduction).""Amazon efforts to promote the expanded Echo product line   appears to have paid off,"" said CIRP Partner Josh Lowitz in a   statement. ""With traditional media advertising and prominent   placement at the Amazon.com website, Echo product awareness among   Amazon customers continued its rapid ascent in the fourth quarter   of 2016.""Echo has benefited from Amazon cleverly building the user   base. It did that by first making the device exclusively   available to Prime members, selling to early adopters for $99,   half its normal price. It then kept adding features, built word   of mouth, and added the cheaper Dot to further grow the   brand.""The installed base of homes with Amazon Echo devices has   grown dramatically, and close to tripled in the past twelve   months,"" said CIRP Partner Mike Levin in a statement. ""Amazon   promoted Echo aggressively over the holiday shopping season, with   especially aggressive pricing for the Echo Dot. The new models   account for close to half of sales since Amazon introduced them   earlier in 2016.""Amazon has created a marketAmazon has the lead and it has a customer base that it can   market to, but it will face challenges to its dominance in this   space.Alphabet's Google released an Echo knockoff for the holiday season and   other major players includingMicrosofthave their own speaker plus voice-controlled AI devices either   available or planned.The online retailer does have two big advantages. First, it   has the 8.2 million customers CIRP estimates own an Echo device.   That can (and should) be a word-of-mouth army taking some of the   fear out of buying a product that many people may be aware of,   but not quite understand. Second, Amazon has hundreds of millions   of customers in its database that it can market to. Those are   people whose shopping habits the retailer knows well, which   should allow it to customize offers to get people to buy an   Echo.Other competitors will certainly succeed in this space, but   Amazon has made the category viable. The retail giant has built a   smart, useful product that has gotten better literally every week   since its introduction. That should make Echo/Alexa a growth   business for Amazon, giving it a valuable beachhead in millions,   eventually tens of millions of homes.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Baby Boomers Love These 5 Brands;1/29/2017;"It would seem common sense that a company that has a closer   relationship with its customers would perform better. The Brand   Intimacy report frommarket research firm MBLMconfirms this. The report reveals that if consumers feel a   strong emotional attachment to a brand -- what it terms ""brand   intimacy"" -- that company enjoys better financial results than   those that don't. MBLM reports that the most intimate brands   produce higher revenues and earnings and better stock price   performance than non-intimate brands. The report identifies the   top companies that have most successfully created and sustained   that connection with their customers.Image source: Getty ImagesmakeArticleAd();Baby boomers represent a disproportionate amount of the wealth   and spending among the population. Some estimate that baby   boomers control as much as 70% of the disposable income in the   country. Areport[opens in PDF] issued by Synchrony Financial indicates that as   consumers, the group is fiercely brand loyal, wants seamless   customer service, and is very comfortable shopping using mobile   devices. In preparing its Brand Intimacy Report, MBLM   surveyed 6,000 consumers between 18 and 64 years old. Those aged   55 to 64 were the oldest subset and are likely representative of   the full baby boomer generation, which most people define as   those between 53 and 71 years old. Let's look at the most adored   brands among this demographic from No. 5 to No. 1, according to   the MBLM survey.Image source: Samsung.5.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) : Samsung was bound to make an appearance on   this list, with its No. 1 position in worldwide smartphone   market. Even in the face of theGalaxy Note 7 fiasco, boomers are brand loyal, and as many as 41% of the owners   surveyed indicated they couldn't live without their device and   nearly 82% say they use their device daily. Samsung is also known   for other home electronics such as TVs, which may play into its   popularity.Baby boomers still love their Coke. Image source: Coca-Cola,     Inc.4. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) : Coca-Cola helped keep soldiers supplied with its   soda pop during World War II, distributing over 5 billion bottles    to U.S. service personnel, for whom the company pledged a   price of 5 cents per bottle. It became a staple in the homes that   boomers grew up in. Coke is legendary for heartstring-tugging   advertising campaigns. ""I'd like to buy the world a Coke"" (1971) and ""Thanks, Mean Joe!"" (1979) were iconic ads of their era, and it's no wonder that   baby boomers feel a connection to this brand. It has continued to   use nostalgia in its message, which taps into the brand loyalty.   Food industry activist Marion Nestle toldThe Washington Postin 2015: ""The advertisements are designed to sell happiness.   They're not selling a drink. But on an emotional level you attach   to it.""Image source: Toyota Motor Corporation.3.Toyota(NYSE: TM) : Baby boomers were out to prove that they were not   their parents and were not bound by the ""Buy American"" mindset.   They were concerned with gathering information when making   purchases and having options. They were also part of the 20th   century trend that viewed a car as freedom and an extension of   themselves.  When the US energy crisis arrived in 1973   and caused gas shortages and long lines at the pumps, boomers   embraced Toyotas as fuel-efficient alternatives to their   gas-guzzling American counterparts.  Toyota has also built   its brand on reliability.Image source: Pixabay.2. Levi Strauss & Company: Levi saw its blue jeans gain popularity in the late 1950s and   early 1960s through such movie icons as Marlon Brando and James   Dean. This development led to a boom in popularity among   then-teen baby boomers. Levi's bell bottoms were a staple of the   counter-culture revolution. This loyalty carried into their   adult lives: Fashions changed, but Levi's remained the same. Baby   boomers are known for their steadfast brand loyalty, and Levi's   have been with them every step of the way.Image source: Amazon.com.1. Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) : Are you surprised that this e-commerce behemoth   is the most beloved by baby boomers? Consider these statistics   from Synchrony Financial: they spend more time online than their   millennial counterparts, with 51% spending 15 hours per week   online, compared with only 41% of millennials. A more telling   statistic is that 70% of boomers report using Amazon at least   once per month. With more money and more time, this demographic   is embracing e-commerce, and nobody is bigger than Amazon.   Boomers want a variety of products and want to be able to find   them. Sounds like a description of Amazon in a nutshell.If this list reveals one thing, it is that there are many ways   to connect with consumers on a visceral level: nostalgia,   utility, or just being where they are. There is no one method   that works across the board. Equally, there is no silver bullet   or single metric one can use when looking to find a winning   investment. There are many data points that should be considered,   and the concept of brand intimacy is merely one additional tool   in an investor's toolkit.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Goes From Window(s) Cleaning to Cloud-Gazing;1/29/2017;"After nearly two years,Microsoft(MSFT) finally reported quarterly revenue growth during the second quarter of 2017. In many ways, Microsoft's performance during the second quarter is a peek into what the future holds for the company. Revenue from the Productivity and Business Process segment and the Intelligent Cloud segment was up10%during the quarter, while More Personal Computing declined by 5% due to lower phone revenues.Microsoft raced past analyst estimates, posting adjusted EPS of83cents on the back of $26.07 billion in revenues, while the market was expecting 79 cents in earnings and $25.3 billion in revenues.The above-average results were made possible by stellar performance from Microsoft's cloud business, whose annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate has now exceeded $14 billion. Microsoft takes the revenue earned from cloud products (Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365) in the final month of the quarter, and multiplies it by 12 to get to its annual cloud run rate. During the first quarter, Microsoft said that its cloud run rate exceeded $13 billion, and in the second quarter it has gone past $14 billion. This means Microsoft's cloud properties brought nearly $1.08 billion in September 2017 and $1.16 billion December 2017.makeArticleAd();Microsoft's cloud-based businesses are still growing sequentially, which is great news for the company as it transitions from being Windows-dependent to being cloud-reliant. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% during the quarter, while Office consumer products and cloud services revenue increased by 22%.Office and related products, especially the cloud-delivered lineup, has been growing in a very strong way for the company. Microsoft has steadily built its lead in this segment, and if the above-47% growth of the last six quarters continues, it will be very difficult for the competition to catch up.Microsoft Azure has been clocking triple-digit growth rates for the past several quarters, and in the second quarter it came very close, posting 93% growth over the prior period. Microsoft noted that Azure compute usage has more than doubled during the quarter.Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, the two forward-looking business streams that are based on cloud delivery, made $14.283 billion during the second quarter, nearly $2.5 billion more than the More Personal Computing segment that hosts Windows OEM, Phone and Gaming revenues. Though Windows OEM revenue increased by 5% during the quarter, Windows revenue are on shaky grounds due to the steady decline of PC sales around the world. As smartphones and tablets keep replacing PCs, the Windows operating system, which has a negligible presence in the mobile world, does not have a great future, at least in the short to medium-term.But second quarter results have already proved that Microsoft has successfully transitioned into a new era, where cloud, not Windows, dominates the revenue landscape. The company is now poised on the threshold of where CEO Satya Nadella wants it to ultimately go, and the next several quarters will make that transition even more pronounced.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stocks mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."
Costco Wholesale Corporation's Worst Move in 2016;1/28/2017;"Costco(NASDAQ: COST) continues to squander an opportunity by operating   as if the internet has not become a major factor in retail.The company has proven resilient in the face of digital   competitors led byAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . While other retailers are shuttering stores,   losing sales, and generally fighting for survival, the warehouse   chain has not had that problem.Costco had a decent fiscal 2016, with comparable-store sales   up 4% globally and 3% in the United States when the impact of   falling gasoline prices is factored out. In addition, net income   for the year was roughly the same as 2015, coming in at $2.35   billion, or $5.33 per diluted share, compared to $2.38 billion,   or $5.37 per diluted share last year.makeArticleAd();Those numbers dropped a little in the first quarter of 2017,   which covers the period ending November 20. During Q1,   comparable-store sales were up just 1%  for the U.S., with   the total company posting a 2% gain. Net income, however, came in   a bit better, with the company reporting $545 million, or $1.24   per diluted share, compared to $480 million, or $1.09 per diluted   share, in Q1 of fiscal 2017.None of these results are spectacular, but in a challenging   retail environment, they are acceptable. What's not seen in these   numbers, though, is that by basically conducting business as   usual, Costco has mostly passed up an opportunity to grow its   digital business.Costco values getting customers into its stores over having     them shop online. Image source: author.What is Costco doing wrong?As a membership-based business, Costco makes most of its   profit (about 75%) by driving people to pay either $55 for a   regular membership or $110 for a Gold Star membership, which   comes with 2% cash back on purchases at the chain's stores or on   its website. Once people join, they only save money if they   actually shop at the chain, and those who shell out the extra $55   to be an Executive Member take that to heart.""Executive Members now account for a little over a third of   our base and a little more than two-thirds of our sales, where   Executive Members are offered,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during   the company's Q4 2016 earnings call.That audience, a group that has a willingness to shop more at   Costco, could easily be part of an expanded digital push by the   company. Instead, Costco largely ignored the internet in   2016.The warehouse club holds onto members in part because they see   value in the chain's low prices and its merchandise mix. Online   sales could be used to extend both of those propositions while   also adding convenience as an added benefit. Costco doesn't   appear to see that value, and rather than viewing digital as a   way to take sales from competitors, it appears to look at   online/app sales as giving its customers a reason to not visit   its stores.Galanti addressed the lack of digital focus during the   earnings call. He acknowledged some issues with the company's   website, but also implied that the company does not consider   online sales a priority.""You will see some differences and mostly the differences are   from an offensive standpoint, not a defensive standpoint,"" he   said. ""But we look at our core business of getting you in the   store still is paramount to what we want to do.""This is opportunity lostDuring the call, Galanti said that in a broad sense, the   internet takes sales ""a little bit from everybody."" That may be   true, and Amazon has certainly done damage to most retailers, but   Costco has a clear way to compete because its members pay to join   and would likely be responsive to a better website, increased   online deals, and perhaps even greater cash-back deals for   Executive Members for digital spending.Costco seems to view any effort to push customers to buy   online as something that will cut down on store visits. Instead,   it should be viewing any online sales it can make as a way to win   business that's going to Amazon and other online retailers.The warehouse club has done a good job of protecting its   in-store business, but it has missed opportunities to leverage   its user base online. Galanti said that should change at least a   little in 2017 with the company improving the performance of its   website and making it easier to check out.That's a start, but it's the bare minimum for what the company   should be doing. Costco could be a digital powerhouse greatly   increasing overall sales by giving its members reasons to not go   to Amazon or other online retailers. Not doing that just because   it might cut down on store traffic was a short-sighted mistake in   2016. It needs to be fixed in the coming year, or at some point,   the warehouse club may not prove to be as immune to online   competitors as it has been.10 stocks we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation's Cloud-Computing Business Is Surging;1/28/2017;"Software giantMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) stock rose about 2.3% on Friday after the   company reported better-than-expected fiscal 2017 second-quarter   results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.83 on adjusted   revenue of $25.8 billion were 6% and 2%, respectively, better   than analysts' consensus estimate for the quarter.But there's a more interesting story from the quarter than the   company's market-beating financial results. Microsoft's   cloud-computing business, Azure, which competes directly withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw its revenue   skyrocket 93%, or 95% in constant currency.Here's a look Azure's growth, and why it's important.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.About Azure's growthAzure is a cloud-computing business giving enterprise   customers scale and efficiency for secure server infrastructure   and cloud applications. And it's driving results for   Microsoft.With 93% year-over-year growth in revenue, Azure played an   important role in the growth in Microsoft's intelligent cloud   segment, which delivered $6.9 billion in revenue for the company   during the second quarter, up 8% year over year and 10% in   constant currency.Investors should take notice of this key growth driver for   Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment. Though Microsoft doesn't   break out Azure's exact revenue figures, or even Azure's   operating margin, there's no mistake that the intelligent cloud   segment to which Azure belongs is important to the company's   results. The overall segment accounted for 43% of Microsoft's   overall operating profits in Q2 -- a level that will likely grow   as Azure becomes a larger part of this segment.Big opportunityIf the performance of Amazon's AWS is any indication of the   potential for Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing segment has a   promising future. Indeed, based on AWS' robust performance, Azure   has likely already morphed into a significant cash cow for   Microsoft.Amazon, which provides direct visibility into the financials   of its AWS unit, generates about 75% of its total operating   profits from the cloud-computing segment. Further, AWS is a   growth machine for Amazon. In Amazon's most recently reported   quarter, for instance, AWS operating income soared about 100%   year over year, to $861 million.Indeed, Microsoft seemed to confirm the profit-driving   characteristics of Azure in the company's second-quarter earnings   call. During the call, management said a 2 percentage point   year-over-year increase in its commercial cloud gross margin, to   48%, was ""largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin   percentage.""Azure. Image source: Microsoft.Azure's success is a particularly positive development for   Microsoft since management indicates that the segment's   performance carries over to the company's intelligent cloud   segment in its entirety. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood explained (via a   Reuterstranscript) this interlinking between Azure and other components of the   company's cloud segment:So, when I think about the material gross margin improvement     we saw on Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on.     Where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers     ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate     consistently, securely, through one interface, you'll actually     see growth across all components of that cloud.It benefits margin, not just in Azure, but across, actually,     the entirety of the cloud.In other words, not only is Azure's revenue and profitability   increasing rapidly, but its impact on the company's overall   intelligent cloud business is growing. At this rate, Azure is   bound to have a meaningful impact on Microsoft's overall growth   in the coming years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com reports Q4 earnings February 2;1/28/2017;"What's HappeningTech titan Amazon.com (AMZN) will report its fourth-quarter numbers on February 2. The company will announce its quarterly results after the market close, with the consensus calling for earnings of $1.41 per share. During the same period last year the company earned $1.00, and the stock is up 43.1% over the last twelve months.Technical AnalysisAMZN was recently trading at $834.64, down $12.57 from its 12-month high and $360.64 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for AMZN are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $805.00 and has recent resistance below $843.75. Of the 29 analysts who cover the stock, 22 rate it a ""strong buy"", four rate it a ""buy"", two rate it a ""hold"", and one rates it a ""strong sell"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 4 STARS ""Buy"" ranking.Analyst's ThoughtsAmazon has been a Wall Street darling for many years, and investors remain very bullish on the stock. The stock trades at $834.64, but analysts have an average price target of $907.11, which suggests 8.6% upside potential. E-commerce has dramatically altered the face of retail, but its importance continues to grow. E-commerce currently accounts for less than 10% or all retail sales. In 2015, online sales were around $1.5 trillion, but that figure is forecast to hit $4 trillion by 2020. The number of customers who signed up for Amazon Prime rose around 38 percent last quarter, and that will be a key metric to pay attention to in Q4. Another reason to be upbeat on the stock is its Amazon Web Services, which has captured around 31% of the cloud-computing market, and revenue for the segment was up 55% last quarter. The company has so much going on, with its e-commerce business, cloud-computing business, and hardware offerings such as Amazon Echo and Fire TV. Amazon is constantly looking to innovate, and as such the company's best days are still ahead. Earnings are expected to rise 41% year over year, and barring any huge earnings miss the stock will likely break out to a new all-time high following the report.Stock Only TradeIf you're looking to establish a long stock position in AMZN, consider buying the stock under $834.00. Sell if it falls below $750.50 or take profits if it gets to $959.00.Bullish TradeIf you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on AMZN, consider an April 730/735 bull-put credit spread for a 40-cent credit. That's a potential 8.7% return (37.8% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 11.9% to cause a problem.Bearish TradeIf you want to take a bearish stance on AMZN at this time, consider an April 925/930 bear-call credit spread for a 50-cent credit. That's a potential 11.1% return (48.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 10.9% to cause a problem.Covered Call TradeIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basis on a new position, you may want to consider an April $830.00 covered call. Buy AMZN shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the April $830.00 call for a debit of $792.25 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 4.7%, and a target annualized return of 20.9% (for comparison purposes only)."
Cisco Snatches IPO Baby from the Arms of Wall Street;1/27/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();On January 24,Cisco (CSCO)revealed they were buying a private company called AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. The funny thing is that the little guy already had a stock symbol picked out, APPD, for its scheduled IPO this week. Talk about a buzzer-beater.But Cisco is also viewed as paying a hefty premium for a software firm specializing in a niche called application performance management (APM). Why would they do that?According to Pacific Crest Securities, ""AppDynamics is a natural fit for Cisco's portfolio, in our view, given its ability to monitor legacy applications and infrastructure and its growing presence in next-generation application deployments.""AppDynamics' software stack now allows Cisco's product portfolio to extend its insight across the network, security and application layers.

10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmidst the bombast, braggadocio and fact-free claims of the 2016 presidential campaign, perhaps the most effective was the subtext contained in President Trump's incessantly cited mantra, ""Make America Great Again.""makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe implication of this successful sonnet of sloganism is that America is not great, at least not in its current iteration. And while certainly an effectual rhetorical rallying point for the most disaffected voters, the claim fails to hold up to scrutiny when one takes a more lucid view of the corporate and investing landscape.Indeed, there are scores of companies, and scores of stocks to own, that already make America great. These are the companies that make the products and services that Americans organize their lives around. Creators of communication devices, social media networks and information retrieval services are just a few of the brilliant achievements of entrepreneurial Americans that have made the country great through the genius of their ideas.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018They're also among the top companies, and the top stocks, that make our nation great for investors. If you want to feel good about the country, and about the prospects for long-term portfolio performance, here are 10 stocks to own thatalreadymake America great.Stocks to Buy: Boeing (BA)Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrPremier American aircraft manufacturerBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) also is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company supplies Western military forces with the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, which also are capable of precision strategic bombing runs crucial to defeating enemies such as the Islamic State.Just check out this footage of an F-18 delivering ISIS fighters a dead-on strike with a500-lb laser guided bomb[Graphic content warning] and you'll be convinced of the efficacy of its fighter jets in the effort against a determined, well-funded and ideologically inspired army.Yet Boeing is far more than just a builder of military hardware. The company's iconic ""7 Series"" passenger jets - the 747, 737, 777 and 787 - have allowed not just Americans, but travelers worldwide to speed off to their destinations safely, and in style. If you want evidence of American corporate greatness, just look to the sky near any major metropolitan airport. You're sure to spot the greatness of Boeing in flight.Stocks to Buy:Amazon.com (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockOnline seller of everythingAmazon.com(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making America great for nearly 23 years. The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos began life as a hub where avid readers could get the latest novels, and discover both new and old works that would appeal to their tastes.That formula worked not only for literature, but for everything from music, film, video games, electronics, clothing, toys, toothpaste … and just about anything else one can require or desire.Amazon.com's relatively recent foray into the cloud computing business has been an unequivocal success, with the company raking in some $3.2 billion in cloud computing revenue in the third quarter of 2016.3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald'sThat figure was up 55% from the same quarter the year prior. Amazon's web services business proves that not only does the company make America great by delivering the products we want right to our door, it also makes possible many of the e-commerce sites the American - and global - economy relies on to function smoothly.Stocks to Buy:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrPersonal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only one of the most profitable companies in history, it's alsothe most admired. And why shouldn't it be?The ubiquity, efficacy, ease of operation, quality, sophisticated industrial design and just outright aesthetic beauty of the company's products is a feat of entrepreneurial genius that on its own can be cited as a ""drop-the-mic"" reason why America already deserves the greatness title.The company's iconic products - the Mac, iPod, iPad and iPhone - all have transformed the way not only Americans live, but also the way most of the developed and developing nations live. AAPL stock ran into a slowdown for much of 2016, but since Election Day, Wall Street has made Apple shares great again, with a surge of more than 10%.Investors are clearly betting on the continued upside likely to come with the release of the company's 10th-anniversary iPhone. If you want proof America is already great, just check your iMessages.Stocks to Buy:Facebook (FB)Source: ShutterstockSocial media pioneerFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is a relatively recent entry into the ranks of companies making America great, and it's done so by the sheer disruptive power of its product.The creation of CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the kind of game-changing invention that comes along infrequently, but when it does it's hard to see how we ever got along without it.From connecting with old friends to staying in contact with relatives; and from discovering new interests, nurturing hobbies and networking with others who share similar worldviews, Facebook has become an essential part of the American (and global) experience.Ironically, Facebook's flap with ""fake news"" and its ranking of certain news stories was an issue in the presidential campaign. Yet Facebook also was cited by President Trump as a key to his victory, as he told CBS'60 Minutesthat thepower of his following on the social media gianthelped him win key races where he was outspent by his opponent.The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017So, Facebook not only already makes America great, it also made President Trump's campaign a winner.Stocks to Buy:Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostIf you were asked to compile a list of the ""Big Banks"" that have financed America's growth, as well as her ascension to greatness, it's hard not to start withGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS).The premier investment bank has been at the center of the financial world since the reparative, post-Civil War years, when it helped finance America's rebirth beginning in 1869.Since then the company has had a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of the greatest capitalist experiment in history.In another example ofTrumpianirony, the president criticized the banks - and specifically Goldman Sachs - for transgressions that caused the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. Yet who did Trump turn to for key positions in his campaign and in his cabinet? You guessed it,numerous Goldman Sachs alumni.The moral of the story here is that when you want your own administration to be great, you turn to those who have done great things at one of the greatest American financial institutions.Stocks to Buy:Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockPerhaps the only thing not great aboutAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), better known as Google, is its ghastly choice of new moniker. Yet despite its ill-fitting name, Alphabet's core product - the Google search engine - has already made information-seeking America great.Founded by then-Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were at Stanford University, the tech entrepreneurs leveraged the PC and internet explosion and created the go-to source for information on just about anything imaginable.Its corporate mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, has long been accomplished. And though Google has only been in existence for less than 20 years, like Facebook, it also has become an essential part of the American and the international experience.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsJust try to go more than a few days without using Google. It's nearly impossible, especially if you are someone who loves knowing things.Stocks to Buy:Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockAnyone who has grown up in America since the 1940s, or who has reared children or grandchildren over the past five decades, knows all-too-well the draw that is theWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS).Purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and so many others, the company has built a media and entertainment empire by knowing what Americans (and the world) want to see.Disney's relatively recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise is proof of the company's commitment to remaining the leader in providing entertainment with the broadest appeal.Founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, the Disney Company was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that, and that it will remain great long after President Trump has completed his tenure in the Oval Office.Stocks to Buy:American Express (AXP)Source:Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrWhen ""American"" is part of your name, it's easy to make the short hop of logic needed to proclaimAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) a company that's already making America great. Indeed, the credit card issuer, andDow Jonescomponent, offers what is arguably the best customer service in the financial services industry.Moreover, it's an aspirational brand that pulls at the capitalist heart strings of nearly every American set on achieving financial prowess. For those who've experienced it, how can you forget being approved for your first American Express card? That grant signifies an arrival of sorts into an honored clubhouse of the financially fit.Here, too, irony and the Trump administration once again collide. If President Trump and the Republican Congress can get personal tax reform passed, American Express shares may be the biggest beneficiary. The reason why is because higher income and higher net worth consumers tend to use American Express more than rival credit cards.3 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Income and GrowthAs such, a reduction in marginal tax rates for the nation's top earners would likely translate into increased spending via AmEx - which would funnel down directly to AXP shares.Stocks to Buy:Caterpillar (CAT)Source:Anthony via FlickrThe makers of earth-shaping equipment have literally transformed the American landscape into man's image, a feat that on its own qualifiesCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) for a spot on the 10 stocks that already make America great.The unmistakable CAT brand is responsible for helping more builders erect more homes, shopping centers, office buildings, roads, bridges and dams than any government infrastructure project could ever do.In fact, any effort to make America's infrastructure great again would likely start with a whole lot of equipment from Caterpillar, as its heavy machinery is an integral part of massive build outs here at home, and worldwide.The CAT brand also is seen as a sort of badge of honor in the developing world, as developing nations seek to build their infrastructure in the image of the American landscape. To the rest of the world, America is already great … and they often use Caterpillar equipment to help their own nations look like us.Stocks to Buy:Tesla Motors (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockAmerica is a car culture country, and many of her most iconic brands -General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) - represent the best of American industrial prowess.While these storied brands could themselves be on any list of stocks that already make America great, one new car company embodies all of the entrepreneurial and innovative genius that's at the heart of what makes America special. That company isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).The brainchild of the ceaselessly creative Elon Musk, Tesla has proven that luxury, performance and the lack of an internal combustion engine can be a splendid marriage; one never lacking in operator excitement. In fact, the experience of driving the posh, powerful and eminently smooth Model S through traffic is akin to what it must be like piloting a modern fighter jet through a formation of P-51 Mustangs.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryAnd while the World War II fighter helped make America great by vanquishing her enemies in aerial combat, Tesla's Model S, Model X and Model 3 are clearing a new path for automotive technology - technology that could be the American and global standard in decades to come.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AMZN, FB, GS and TSLA stock.The post10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Greatappeared first onInvestorPlace."
The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;1/27/2017;"Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. MicrosoftMSFTfor one has strongly resisted government demands as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

eBay's Stock Gains As Q4 Earnings Beat Market Expectations;1/27/2017;"eBay (EBAY) released its Q4 2016 results recently and they were in line with market expectations. The company's revenue grew 3% year over year to $2.4 billion during the quarter driven by consistent low single digit growth in both the marketplace and advertising businesses. The company's adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share were up 8% year over year, just beating analyst consensus estimates of $0.53.Top line growth was driven by an 18% increase in StubHub sales and a 3% increase in Marketing & Advertising revenue over the prior year quarter. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth for eBay and was driven by:  1) structuring data into catalogs (for search engine optimization); 2) diversifying traffic sources; 3) enhancing the seller experience; and, 4) trimming down the asset portfolio. However, this increase was offset by a 9% increase in cost of revenues, which led to a 4% decline in operating income to $638 million in the quarter. Another cause for concern was the decline in free cash flows due to declining cash flows from operations.eBay repurchased $1 billion worth of its own shares in the quarter, bringing last year's total to $3 billion. The company stated that it plans to buyback about $1 billion worth of its shares this year. Owing to the company's market beat and in-line guidance, eBay's stock rose 9% in after-hours trading on Wednesday and is currently about 5% above its pre-earnings price. In the first quarter this year, the company expects revenue between $2.17 billion and $2.21 billion, against consensus estimates of $2.20 billion. It also expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48 per share, against consensus estimates of $0.50.Average Spend Per Users DecliningmakeArticleAd();Although the number of active users continue to rise for eBay, the average spend per user declined in 2016. Compared to an average spend per user of around $129 per quarter in 2015, the figure was $127 per user per quarter in 2016. The consistent decline in every quarter of 2016 is a cause for concern for eBay, especially considering rising competition in e-commerce from Amazon, Walmart, Target and even Groupon. eBay managment stated that it intended to ramp up TV advertisements to attract more millenials and work towards improving product search features on its website for buyers.Have more questions about Ebay?

How Risky Is The Procter & Gamble Company?;1/27/2017;"As a 179-year-old diversified producer of household products,Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) is often regarded as one of the most risk-free stocks   on the market.It's a Dividend Aristocrat to boot, having raised its   quarterly payout for 60 consecutive years, and now offers a   healthy dividend yield. Selling product like soap, laundry   detergent, and razors that are as timeless now as they were a   century ago, the company seems to have a business built to   last.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();P&G may, therefore, look bulletproof -- but looks can be   deceiving.Longevity is no guarantee of future success, as we were   reminded earlier this month when Ringling Bros. and Barnum &   Bailey circus said it would fold up its tent after 146 years in   business. Pressure from animal rights groups forced the   entertainer to cut out elephants from its performances, and   attendance sunk without them. Digital entertainment options that   existed a generation ago like iPads andNetflixalso likely hastened the circus' demise.The Tide-maker may not be facing such an existential threat,   but the competitive landscape is changing in its industry. Here   are a few of the risks investors should be on the lookout   for.E-commerceThe internet has upset the traditional order in retail. It's   created opportunities for upstart brands such as eyewear-maker   Warby Parker to challenge entrenched brick-and-mortar chains, and   Procter & Gamble's biggest brands have also been   affected.Razor-maker Gillette has seen heady competition from online   brands like Dollar Shave Club and Harry's. Dollar Shave Club's   success led Gillette to roll out its own subscription-based   membership program, and Gillette even sued Dollar Shave Club for   patent infringement in 2015. Launched in 2012, Dollar Shave Club   helped cut Gillette's North American market share from 71% to 59%   in the intervening yearsas the start-up built up a membership base of 3.2 million   and was bought byUnilever(NYSE: UL) for $1 billion last year.An even bigger threat to P&G may come fromAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , the great disrupter of this era. Reports emerged   last year that the e-commerce giant would begin making its own   private-label goods, including diapers and laundry detergent.   With tens of millions of Prime members in its ecosystem, Amazon   has a ready-made legion of trusting customers that it could   likely cut off from P&G if it chooses to make quality   products and undercut it on price.A lack of innovationProcter & Gamble was once a hallmark of American   innovation, as it was a pioneer of products like laundry   detergent, fluoride-based toothpaste, and disposable diapers, but   its innovation pipeline has dried out in recent years as the   company has spent a smaller proportion of its revenue on R&D.   Its latest major invention was the Swiffer, the floor-cleaning   system with disposable pads, which it launched in 1999.The company's response to Dollar Shave Club may best   illustrate its attitude toward innovation these days. In 2014,   Gillette released the ProGlide FlexBall razor with a retail price   starting at $11.49, though its only enhancement was a track ball   to guide the razor, and planned to spend $200 million marketing   the new product.In other words, the bulk of the product's budget seemed to go to   marketing, rather than innovation. Gillette later created its own   shave club, but its response to the start-ups has been generally   weak. It could have just bought Dollar Shave Club, but the   company has been so focused on shedding brands that it may be   missing opportunities.Slowing growthPerhaps as a consequence of e-commerce threats, a lack of   innovation and a stronger dollar, Procter & Gamble has seen   its growth slow significantly in recent years. In its most recent   report, organic sales increased 2%, though investors sent the   stock up as it raised its full-year organic sales guidance from   2% to 2-3%.The stock's performance has also been underwhelming in recent   years, as the chart below shows.PGdata byYChartsAs a defensive stock, it's worth noting that P&G may be   more likely to outperform the broader market during a sell-off.   Perhaps more importantly for dividend investors, the company's   dividend growth has slowed dramatically.Procter & Gamble Dividend HistoryCreate line chartsIn the last two years, it hiked its dividend by 3% and then   just 1%. With a payout ratio of 73%, the company has some room to   raise its dividend faster than that, but without significant   increases in earnings growth it will be hard for the company to   beat low-single digit increases.Ultimately, what defines risk for an investor is the chance of   losing money on a given investment. With its solid dividend   payout and stable of diversified brands, investors can probably   count on a modest return from P&G in the coming years, but   its recent underperformance against theS&P 500is a lesson. Even for investors looking for low-risk stocks,   there are probably better places to put your money.10 stocks we like better than Procter and     GambleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and standoutBoeing Co(NYSE:BA), which ringed up an impressive 4% move.Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it's easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday's robust gains.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors.GE Stock Is Exciting, and That's Bad!GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons.Click to EnlargeWhile it's very early into the new year, nevertheless, it's worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA.I don't think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%.More worryingly, traders haven't pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results.Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there's a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year - and we've basically burned through two-thirds of that profit.I don't care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it's a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?Just Stay the Course With General ElectricSo should potential buyers heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock has formed an ""inside day"" pattern against the losses incurred by the feeble earnings report. Unless shares can quickly fill the technical gap, momentum definitely leans bearishly. Attempting to catch a falling knife here would not be the greatest idea.Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants InThat said, the month of January is GE stock'skryptonite. The last three Januarys produced a shockingly bad loss of 6%. Since 1962, General Electric has averaged only 0.8% returns for the opening month of the calendar. In nominal terms, there were only 28 positive Januarys over that time frame. That means that GE stock is as useful as a coin toss during the NFL playoffs.However, the industrial titan is a consistent winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an average 13% return. Nominally, 39 years ended sunny side up. This current decade has been particularly robust, averaging over 15%.I've made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you're looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.But even reliable names have their off seasons. Watch General Electric closely, and wait for a baseline of technical support before going in too rich.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20177 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postWhy General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winningappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What We Learned From the 2016 Retail Sales Numbers;1/27/2017;"makeArticleAd();The U.S. Census Bureau recently released its Retail Trade   Report for 2016. Despite negative news around the globe, a hotly   contested U.S. presidential election, and numerous threats to the   economy, consumers upped their spending compared to the previous   year. Here are the details you need to know.Image source: Getty Images.The numbers and why they matterOn the year, total retail and food services spending increased   3.3% over 2015 to $5.5 trillion. During the all-important holiday   shopping season, lasting October through December, sales were up   4.1% from the same period in 2015. Additionally, consumer   spending increased sequentially each month from October through   the end of the year, on consumers' rising comfort with opening up   their wallets for non-essential items.Why should investors care about the report? Well, it means   more than sales for retailers. The monthly and annual retail   sales updates are an important metric for measuring the health of   the overall economy. Spending at the household level makes up   about two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product, a measure of all   goods and services produced in the country.Retail sales specifically are an important indicator because   they show the amount of money families are willing to spend after   basic necessities are paid for. The report includes money spent   on items including furniture, auto parts, groceries, clothing,   and electronics. A slow and steady increase in total retail sales   shows that the average person has more extra money to spend each   month.While the monthly figures bounce around, the average   consumer's willingness to spend an increasing amount would   indicate the economy is still in an upswing.Data source: U.S. Census Bureau's Retail Trade   Report. Chart by author.The report is valuable in gaining insights on the economy, but   is also of interest to investors looking to capitalize on   business trends. The Census Bureau breaks down sales categories   and shows specifically where families are spending their extra   cash. Several industries posted handsome gains in 2016 and look   like they are set to have another strong year in 2017.The picture the numbers paintThe big winners on the year were internet retailers, health   and personal care stores, and restaurants and bars. The biggest   losers were gas stations, department stores, and electronics and   appliance stores. Here is a breakdown of how retail did on the   year by major category.Data source: U.S. Census Bureau's Retail Trade Report. Chart   by author.It might be easy for investors to try and chase stocks in the   categories that are faring the best, but that could be dangerous.   Last year's winners could end up lagging behind going   forward.Looking for longer-term themes in the numbers is a better   strategy. One such theme has been the continuing rise of online   shopping. For years now, internet retail has been growing by   double digits. Sales at nonstore retail, digital retail in the   chart above, grew 11.4% from 2015 to 2016. The obvious play   here would beAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , which got the party started. That party hasn't   ended yet, as Amazon reported a 29% year-over-year increase in   product sales during its third quarter.An Amazon drone gets ready for liftoff. Image source:     Amazon.Traditional brick-and-mortar stores, while late to pick   up on the shift in consumer shopping to online, have   been busy playing catch-up. Last year retail kingWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) , fighting back against declining foot traffic,   announced the closing of 154 stores in the U.S., mostly smaller   formats. The company followed that announcement up with its   acquisition of e-commerce player jet.com over the summer. The   hope is that the move will kick-start Wal-Mart's sales and help   the company return to growth.The move to digital hasn't been limited to just general   merchandise, either. For example, many restaurants and grocery   stores have been rolling out online and mobile ordering   features. An early adopter of this format has beenBuffalo Wild Wings(NASDAQ: BWLD) , which allows customers to order online and   pickup to-go. B-Dubs paired that with a ""Fast Break"" lunch   promotion promising quick turnaround for time-strapped diners.   The company has also begun experimenting with delivery in select   locations, which also feeds into the company's online strategy of   making buying its food more convenient.A 2017 game planWith shoppers indicating their overall comfort in spending   money and 2016 finishing strong, it looks like retail and food   services could have another good year in 2017. Investors looking   to capitalize should hone in on the long-term trend: businesses   that are working on making the consumer experience more   convenient with online features.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon’s New Patent For A Warehouse Robot Could Replace Human Workers;1/27/2017;"The company offered an example in the patent filing that   included a scenario of a robot using section to pick up a coffee   mug off a shelf and place it into a box. If and when they are   successfully developed, these robots would no doubt wind up   replacing hundreds of thousands of human workers that Amazon   currently relies upon to do the job.Axioshas a good explanation of why this shift to automation   matters:Policymakers are trying to understand the impact that     increased automation will have on jobs. Researchers associated     with McKinsey found recently that' ""scenarios suggest that half     of today's work activities could be automated by 2055"" but that     only a small percentage of jobs could be fully automated.makeArticleAd();Currently, it takes about a minute or so for a human warehouse   worker to fulfill an order, which includes wrapping the item,   placing it in a box, taping it up, and sending it off for   shipping. Robots may one day be able to cut that time   dramatically, and eventually be much cheaper than their human   counterparts as well.This development seems to fly in the face of Amazon's recent   announcement that it wouldcreate 100,000 jobsin the United States over the next 18 months. Clearly, those   workers' days are numbered, with technological advances pushing   automation to the next level much sooner than most people   imagine.Amazon.com, Inc.

"Intel (INTC) Beats on Q4 Earnings; '17 View Lacks Shine";1/27/2017;"Intel CorpINTCreported fourth-quarter 2016 non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents per share, which increased almost 4% from the year-ago quarter but declined 1.3% sequentially. Earnings per share (EPS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.makeArticleAd();The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 9.8% increase in revenues, which totaled $16.37 billion and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly $15.80 billion. Revenues increased 3.8% sequentially.The robust year-over-year revenue growth came on the back of impressive results from the Client Computing, Data Center and Internet-of-Things groups, which contributed to almost 88.7% of total revenue in the reported quarter.Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseIntel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Intel Corporation QuoteIn 2016, EPS was $2.72 as compared with $2.49 reported in 2015. Revenues increased 7.5% year over year to $59.49 billion. The company's capital expenditure jumped more than 31% to $9.6 billion reflecting continuing investments on new high-performance chip technology for the emerging markets of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicle.Moreover, Intel's 2017 capital expenditure forecast exhibits continuing investments on the emerging markets. However, revenue growth is expected to remain flat, which will weigh on profitability.We note that Intel has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry in the past one year. While the company's shares gained 25.9%, the industry returned 52.4% in the same period. Moreover, we don't expect the shares to rebound in the near term.Segment Revenue DetailsClient Computing Group(55.8% of revenues) - Intel bundles PCs, notebooks, 2-in-1s, tablets and other computing devices under the Client segment, which actually helps comparison with the PC market numbers provided by IDC and Gartner.Revenues increased 4.3% year over year and 2.7% sequentially to $9.13 billion. The growth rate was encouraging as it continued to beat PC market trends. We believe Intel is gaining share in the emerging, connected and computing devices market, which is neutralizing declines in the core PC market.Overall unit volumes were down 4% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. PC volumes decreased 4% while notebook volumes were flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Tablet volumes continued to decline in the quarter.Average selling prices (ASPs) increased 6% and 7% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. The year-over-year increase came from both PC and notebooks, which were up 2% and 3%, respectively.Data Center Group(28.5% of revenues) - Revenues increased 8.4% year over year and 2.8% sequentially to $4.67 billion. Data Center volume declined 3% sequentially but gained 3% from the year-ago quarter. ASP increased 6% sequentially and 4% from year-ago quarter.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in the data centers from the cloud-based service providers like Amazon.comAMZN, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFTis a key catalyst for Intel.Internet of Things Group(4.4% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 16.2% from the year-ago quarter and 5.4% quarter over quarter to $726 million. The growth was backed by strength in retail, video and transportation applications.Non-Volatile memory solutions group(5% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 24.8% year over year and 25.7% sequentially to $816 million.Memory is a commodity-type business, so prices vary widely depending on available supply. Intel is expected to launch data storage products based on 3D XPoint technology in 2017, which is encouraging in our view.These products bring the kind of differentiation to Intel's memory business that could help it generate stable memory demand and pricing in an otherwise commodity-type market. The goal is to take these technologies to Data Center and enterprise customers, where they will generate solid revenue and profits. Further, XPoint is likely to have broader application.Intel Security Group(3.4% of revenues) - Revenues grew 7.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially to $550 million.In September, Intel announced that it is divesting a majority stake in the division to alternative asset fund manager TPG. The deal valued at $4.2 billion includes an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for the security division in addition to net debt of approximately $2 billion.Intel anticipates realizing a pre-tax gain on the sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in second-quarter 2017.Programmable solutions group(2.6% of revenues) - The Altera business is now the Programmable Solutions Group, declining 1.2% sequentially and generated $420 million in revenues in the last quarter.Intel also has a residual segment, which includes results of operations from New Technology Group and other adjustments. The segment reported revenues of $65 million up 10.2% from the year-ago quarter and 47.7% on a sequential basis.Operating DetailsThe gross margin for the quarter was 63.1%, which contracted 160 basis points (bps) sequentially and 170 bps year over year, better than guided 63%. The contraction resulted from higher factory start-up costs (primarily on 10 nm), higher product warranty, and IP charges and investments on the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group as well as Altera acquisition.Research & development (R&D) and marketing, general & administrative (MG&A) increased 3.8% year over year and 7.2% sequentially to $5.44 billion, lower than management's guided range of $5.2 billion. As percentage of revenues, R&D and MG&A declined 190 bps on a year-over-year basis but increased 100 bps sequentially in the quarter.The operating margin was 29.9%, down 270 bps sequentially but up 20 bps year over year. Segment wise,Client Computing groupoperating margin were 38.6% up 750 bps on a year-over-year basis and 120 bps sequentially. The massive expansion came on the back of lower investments and declining costs.Data Center groupoperating margin was 40.3%, as compared with 50.5% in the year-ago quarter and 46.5% in the previous quarter. The decline can be attributed to higher investments on Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product.Internet of Thingsgroup operating margin was 25.1% as compared with 21.3% in the year-ago quarter and 27.7% in the previous quarter.Intel Security groupoperating margin expanded 330 bps on a year-over-year basis but declined 270 bps sequentially to 18.7%.Non-Volatile memory solutions groupreported loss of $91 million as compared with profit of $24 million in the year-ago quarter primarily attributed to start-up cost for China factory and costs associated with 3D XPoint.However,Programmable solutions groupreported profit of $80 million in the quarter.Balance SheetCash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter end was almost $17.10 billion, down $670 million during the quarter.Intel has $20.65 billion in long-term debt now as well as $4.63 billion in short-term debt, which has led to a net debt balance of $8.18 billion.Intel paid dividends of $4.9 billion and used $2.6 billion to repurchase 81 million shares in 2016.GuidanceIntel guided first-quarter 2017 revenues of around $14.8 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially. The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63% (+/-1%). R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to come in at around $5.3 billion.Operating income is projected to be approximately $4.1 billion, while earnings are anticipated to be 65 cents (+/- 5 cents) per share.For full-year 2017, management expects revenues to remain flat and gross margin of 63% (+/-2%).

"'Favorite Trump Trade' GrubHub Eyes Bigger Pie; Can It Deliver?";1/27/2017;"In a world where convenience is key and time is valuable,GrubHub(GRUB) has made a name for itself in food delivery.""I-want-it-now"" millennials are pushing more services online,   and GrubHub boasts not only the largest online food ordering   platform in the U.S., but also considerable name recognition and   a first-mover advantage.The Chicago-based firm also is expected to be one of the   biggest beneficiaries of the highly anticipated corporate tax   reform set to be enacted by President Donald Trump, as it   conducts nearly all its business in the U.S. GrubHub is   currently swallowing a tax rate of approximately 40%.makeArticleAd();Credit Suisse analyst Paul Bieber calls GrubHub a ""favorite   Trump trade,"" saying in a Jan. 10 note that a lower rate would   ""significantly increase GrubHub's (earnings) potential."" He   estimates a 5% reduction would drive 10 cents to 12 cents of   incremental earnings per share on an annual basis. Bieber   has an outperform rating and 48 price target on GrubHub.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak upgraded the company   to overweight on Jan. 13 with a 44 target price. He echoes that   GrubHub ""is among the biggest potential beneficiaries (of tax   cuts) in our coverage universe.""32% Earnings GainGrubHub will issue its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 8.   Earnings are projected to rise 32% to 25 cents while revenue   increases 37% to $137.3 million. After coming off a low of 35.90   Jan. 10, GrubHub stock rose that day and in 10 out of the last 12   trading days. Shares were down nearly 2% Monday in the wake of   Trump's immigration ban fracas, but recovered and were down only   fractionally at the close.[ibdchart symbol=""GRUB"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter""   position=""leftchart"" ]The stock has gained roughly 20% from its   34.66 low on Nov. 11 amid the prospect of a lower tax burden, and   is now about 6% below a 44.68 buy point from a consolidation   base. The stock's Relative Strength Rating of 92 puts it among   the best stocks when it comes to recent price performance.Looking at the big picture, GrubHub is a turnaround stock. By   January 2016, shares had fallen 63% from their April 2015   all-time high. But the stock has since recouped nearly all of   those losses, earning it a spot on the IBD 50 list of leading   growth stocks.Over the past 18 months, the company has been investing in key   markets to deepen its penetration, as well as expanding to new   markets where it ""can see rapid growth,"" Chief Executive Matt   Maloney said on the company's third-quarter conference call Oct.   26.And looking ahead, ""the majority of our spend and our   investments will be in driving efficiency and increasing the   network and availability of our drivers in the markets we are   already in,"" he said.7.7 Million DinersAlong with Seamless, which was acquired in 2013 to drive   scale, GrubHub now boasts some 7.7 million active diners in over   1,000 cities ordering from more than 45,000 local   restaurants.That list of restaurants keeps growing by leaps and bounds,   and accelerates as time passes. In 2015, it added 1,750, while in   the first half of 2016 alone it's estimated to have added 2,000   more. Morgan Stanley's Nowak projects that 2,205 were added   in the second half of last year.What's unclear is how many outlets GrubHub added after landing   a couple of big fish last year. It inked deals with Subway and   P.F. Chang's, among other pacts, during the third quarter. Subway   has nearly 45,000 restaurants worldwide with nearly 27,000 of   those in the United States, while P.F. Chang's has more than 200   restaurants domestically, but it's unclear how many of those   outlets GrubHub will be serving.Still, that kind of expansion is helping GrubHub address one   of the key reasons for customer churn on its platform. Nowak says   his most recent AlphaWise survey data found that 44% of   participants named ""limited restaurant selection"" their No. 1   reason for not following through with a transaction on a food   delivery platform. That beats out other reasons, like slow   delivery, poor food condition and expense.Along with a wider selection, GrubHub has made other   improvements to its platform to increase conversion rates,   meaning turning an app user to a purchaser. Maloney says that   GrubHub is leveraging the data that flows through its platform to   personalize its site.""Releasing these features has generated substantially more   data on our diner's preferences as well as insight on what drives   diner engagement and conversion higher,"" Maloney said on the   call.IBD'S TAKE:GrubHub is still a ways from hitting a buy point, but has     gained huge strides in recent weeks, up 10 out of the last 12     sessions. The stock is tops in IBD's Internet-Content group and     holds a98 Composite Ratingout of a possible 99.GrubHub also launched a full rebrand earlier in 2016, and says   that improved marketing has helped contribute to its active diner   growth, which hit 19% in the third quarter.""Active diner growth (a sign of GRUB's ability to bring on new   users) and gross food sales (GFS) per active diner (measuring   GRUB's ability to grow share of stomach) remain the two most   important metrics in evaluating the health of GRUB's business,""   Nowak said, adding that he sees ""bullish indicators in both of   these, which are likely to lead to higher earnings power and   upward revisions.""Long List Of RivalsWhile GrubHub claims the largest market share among online   food delivery platforms - excludingDomino's(DPZ) - the competition is heating up. Not only do you have   names like DoorDash, Postmates, Foodler and OrderUp, butYelp(YELP) has Eat24,Square(SQ) has Caviar,Amazon(AMZN) has Prime Now for restaurants and Uber has UberEats.All vary on their delivery minimums, delivery fees and tip   protocols. GrubHub typically has a $10 minimum and $2.99 fee,   plus tip, and some restaurants offer GrubHub ordering with   self-pickup.But for the delivery option, if you factor in your opportunity   cost - that is, the time you save by not having to drive   somewhere to get the food, wait to pick it up yourself, then   drive back home - the benefit could outweigh the premium   paid.It seems America agrees: Credit Suisse's Bieber has compiled   data that point to some $245 billion in chain and independent   restaurant takeout revenue in 2013, and that number has certainly   grown since.Bieber calculates GrubHub's penetration of the independent   takeout market hit 4% at the end of 2016. As an underpenetrated   market opportunity remains, Maloney said on the conference call   the company is definitely in the early innings.""There's a lot of work to do, both in aggregating data and   presenting the data and then capturing the output of those   actions,"" Maloney said. ""But ... I think that it is going to   be hugely valuable for restaurants and then our business in   line.""RECENTLY IN NEW AMERICA:Incyte Has Insight Into Market With Potential     Blockbuster DrugsCotiviti Poised To Weed Out Massive Wasteful     Health SpendingBurlington Rebrands Itself To Show It's More     Than Just Coats"
Alphabet (GOOGL) Misses on Q4 Earnings, Beats Revenues;1/27/2017;"AlphabetGOOGLfourth-quarter earnings of $7.56 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.65 due to higher taxes. However, earnings were up 7.1% year over year.Following weaker-than-expected earnings, shares were down more than 2% in after-hours trading. Higher cost of revenue and steeper taxes impacted the quarter's earnings.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 19.43% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.On the Other Bets side, most of the businesses included in it are in their early stages. However, it is gradually picking up. Management said that Nest, Fiber and Verily were revenue contributors in the fourth quarter.The main drivers of the Google business haven't changed. Pricing remains under pressure both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth of 36% remains a reassuring number.Google continues to enjoy strength on the mobile platform. One of the drivers is Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This is being accepted by many publishers and sites around the world covering more than 700,000 domains. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge data base. As a result, direct response marketers remain interested in it.Google also mentioned messaging as an important addition to its product line in the form of Allo (mobile messaging) and Duo (video messaging) to further drive user experience. Also, the company said that Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business.The company has greater control on the browser through Android as well as distribution agreements with Apple (AAPL). But the upcoming threats shouldn't be ignored. Apple may not renew its agreement, MicrosoftMSFTWindows 10 could steal overall search market share, FacebookFBgraph search and the social network itself could take away advertising dollars, and AmazonAMZNalready takes care of most product searches.Management said that YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers everyday.And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.The Numbers in DetailRevenuesGross total revenue of $26.06 billion grew 16.1% sequentially and 22.2% year over year (up 24% in constant currency or CC). The increase was primarily driven by the strength in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in newer investment areas and solid progress in Other Bets aided revenue growth.The geographic distribution was as follows: the U.S. generated around 49% of revenues, up 19.8% sequentially. The U.K., with an 8% revenue share was up 10.5% sequentially. Other international markets accounted for the balance, representing sequential increase of 14.1%.Google SegmentThe segment includes search, advertising, Play, hardware and Cloud & Apps.Coming to the search business, on a sequential basis, revenues from Google-owned sites grew 11.7%, while that from partner sites increased 18.7% resulting in a total advertising revenue growth of 13.0%.Google-owned sitesand partner sites grew 20.3% and 7.0%, respectively, year over year and brought in 69% and 17% of quarterly revenues.Management said that mobile search continued to benefit from improvements in ad formats and delivery initiated in the third quarter of 2015 as well as remained optimistic about search revenue growth on both tablets and desktops. TrueView and DoubleClick Bid Manager were the primary drivers of YouTube revenue although app promotions are becoming bigger contributors.The traditional AdSense benefited from strength in programmatic and AdMob, offset by a decline in the traditional network business.Other revenue was up 39.9% sequentially and 62.0% year over year to just over 13% of fourth quarter revenue. The strength was on account of Play Store sales (apps, content) and cloud revenues.Other Bets SegmentAlphabet broke out the segment for the first time in the March quarter of2016. The segment includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest and incubation activities in X Labs. Revenues were up 33.0% sequentially and 74.7% year over year.Since this segment is a combination of several businesses that are in the pre-revenue stage, operating different models and serving diverse end markets, the results are likely to be lumpy in any given quarter.Total traffic acquisition cost, or TAC(the portion of revenue shared with Google's partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website) was up 15.9% sequentially and 19.6% year over year.TAC paid out to network partners were up 17.5% sequentially and 7.6% year over year. Mobile search carries higher TAC so the increase in mobile search revenue is driving related TAC according to management.TAC for distribution arrangements was up 13.3% sequentially and 48.3% year over year.Net advertising revenue, excluding TAC was up 12.2% sequentially and 16.8% year over year.Revenue net of TAC came in at $21.22 billion, up 16.1% sequentially and 22.8% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.58 billion.MarginsGross margin of 59.1% shrank 216 bps sequentially and 251 bps from the year-ago quarter.Price declines remained negative in both sequential and year-over-year comparisons as the mix continued to move toward lower-margin business.Cost per click (CPC) was down a respective 9% and 15% from the previous and year-ago quarters. On a sequential basis, CPC was down 11% on Google sites but remained flat on network sites. On Google sites, CPCs were down 16% from the year-ago quarter, while network CPC declined 19%.Paid clicks grew 20% sequentially and 36% year over year, helped in part by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. Google sites did better than Network sites with paid clicks growing 23% and 43%, respectively, from the previous and year-ago quarters. Network paid clicks also increased 6% sequentially and 7% from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses of $8.76 billion increased 9.8% sequentially and 12.9% from the December quarter of 2015. The operating margin was 25.5%, down 22 bps sequentially but up 425 bps from the year-ago quarter.Non-operating gains were $218 million compared with $278 million in the previous quarter and ($180) million in the Dec 2015 quarter.Alphabet reported net income of $5.33 billion, or 20.5% of sales, compared with $5.06 billion, or 22.5% of sales in the Sep 2016 quarter and $4.92 billion, or 23.1% of sales in the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings of $7.56 a share were up from $7.25 in the previous quarter and $7.06 in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetAlphabet has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short-term investments of around $86.33 billion, up $3.27 billion from the third quarter. The company generated around $9.41 billion of cash from operations in the fourth quarter and spent $3.08 billion on capex, netting a free cash flow of $6.34 billion.Alphabet also spent $662 million on acquisitions and $13 million to repay some debt.Alphabet Inc.

Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;1/26/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 26, 2017-Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day andValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onApple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) andNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.makeArticleAd();And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T,CiscoorAlphabetare customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApplewith radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.Bear of the Day:I don't enjoy kicking this once-beloved company when it's down, butValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)has it coming (again) as earnings estimates slip.In the past week, another investment bank revised lower their EPS projection for this year, knocking the the Zacks Consensus down to $5.17 from $5.30.And in the past 90 days, the profit outlook has fallen from $7.70. This puts annual growth at -5.6% after a 2016 that could end up at over -30% ""growth.""This is why VRX shares are in the cellar of the Zacks Rank again.But it doesn't mean you should run out and sell yours only $1 from multi-year lows. The company is still projected to deliver nearly $9.2 billion in sales this year with hundreds of products and steady earners like Jublia and Wellbutrin.The unknown risks are what happens with any legal investigations or the company's massive debt load. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 7X for this $4.7 billion company and the debt-to-capital ratio may be over 87X.Analysts Weigh In On the Debt IssueOn January 11, Canaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka was encouraged by Valeant's recent moves to address the leverage...""Valeant has taken its first significant steps towards de-levering its balance sheet, announcing the divestiture of Dendreon and several dermatology brands (including CereVe) for combined cash consideration of ~$2.1 billion.""The analyst noted that the downside of this move is that the company may be forced to sell more quality drug franchises like CereVe, thus hurting sales and operating cash flow. ""Following these divestitures, we estimate that Valeant will have total debt of $28.3 billion remaining, representing a leverage ratio of 6.9x forward EBITDA (down from 7.1x previously).""On January 20, Deutsche Bank reiterated their Hold rating on VRX shares and dropped their price target from $24 to $20. Analyst Gregg Gilbert talked about the company's challenges...""We expect VRX to provide its 2017 outlook sometime between now and when it reports 4Q results (date not yet set). Recall that management provided 'hand signals' on its 3Q call in November that revenue and EBITDA would be down in 2017 vs. 2016. In anticipation of this event, we have updated our model to reflect recent developments and management commentary. The key elements of our changes relate to recently-announced divestitures, loss of exclusivity (LOE) for several products in 2016/17, and FX headwinds.""Additional content:Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in     IndiaOn Wednesday,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report)executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) - Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Thursday’s Vital Data: eBay Inc (EBAY), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD);1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are poised to open in record territory this morning, as theDow Jones Industrial Averagepushes further north of 20,000. Corporate earnings and optimism for business-friendly policies out of the Donald Trump administration continue to push stocks steadily higher ahead of a fresh round of economic data this morning. Reports on tap today include weekly jobless claims, the January Markit services purchasing managers index, December's leading economic indicators and new home sales.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave added 0.16%, withS&P 500futures up 0.04% andNasdaq-100futures rallying 0.19%.On the options front, volume was brisk on Wednesday, with about 20.2 million calls and 16.3 million puts crossing the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to a one-month low of 0.61, though the 10-day moving average held at 0.65 for the sixth straight session.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,eBay Inc(NASDAQ:EBAY) saw mixed options activity ahead of last night's quarterly report - which revealed robust holiday-shopping results for the retailer. Meanwhile, options traders geared up forAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) quarterly report next week after a report from Slice Intelligence revealed that Amazon dominated holiday sales. Finally,Rite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) continued to struggle amid falling expectations for aWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NYSE:WBA) buyout.eBay Inc (EBAY)EBAY stock is up over 7% in premarket trading after the company postedstrong fourth-quarter earnings and guided higher for fiscal 2017. For the quarter, eBay said it earned 54 cents per share on revenue of $2.4 billion, beating expectations for 53 cents per share on revenue of $2.4 billion.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in February""During the holiday season, eBay was one of the top consumer shopping destinations in the world and the second most visited eCommerce site in the U.S."" eBay Chief Executive Devin Wenig said. Looking ahead, eBay predicted first-quarter earnings of 46 cents to 48 cents per share and full year results of $1.98 to $2.03 per share,EBAY options traders were not all that enthusiastic heading into the report. Volume on Wednesday came in at more than 341,000 contracts, with puts making up 53% of the day's take. What's more, the 27 Jan put/call open interest ratio rests at an outsized reading of 1.31, indicating a heavy put presence and lack of confidence in eBay's pending results.The situation is similar looking out to Feb. options, where EBAY stock's put/call OI ratio comes in at 1.31, though you can be sure calls will start to roll in following last night's report.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Amazon.com, the 800-pound gorilla of the retail sector, will join earnings season next week, and a recent report from Slice Intelligence gave investors something to cheer about yesterday.According to Slice, Amazon commanded 38% of the U.S. eCommerce market during the 2016 holiday shopping season. By comparison, second-rankedBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) eked out only a 3.9% market share and brick-and-mortar giantWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) managing even less at 2.6%.The report bodes well for next week's results, with Amazon expected to earn $1.41 per share on sales of $44.77 billion. That said,EarningsWhispers.comsets the bar higher at $1.46 per share.AMZN options traders leaned heavily toward calls in yesterday's session, with these typically bullish bets snapping up 59% of the more than 257,000 contracts traded. However, the 3 Feb put/call OI ratio of 1.27 indicates a heavier put presence where earnings are concerned. Still, given AMZN premiums, much of this weekly activity could be attributed to put selling as traders bank on collecting premium instead of shelling out for riskier, high-priced at- or out-of-the-money options contracts.Rite Aid Corporation (RAD)With less that two days until the agreed upon deadline, the Rite Aid/Walgreens deal still has no extension. The deal all butfell through on Mondayafter the FTC said the current plan to divest 865 stores toFred's, Inc.(NASDAQ:FRED) was not enough to avoid antitrust concerns. Investors expected a deal extension from Rite Aid and Walgreens, but both sides haverefused to commenton the possibility at this point.RAD stock has plunged more than 24% since Monday's news, pushing the shares south of former support at $7. Should the deadline pass this Friday with no extension, we could see RAD fall even further. Options traders appear to be preparing for just such a development, as puts continue to dominate on RAD stock.Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock Will Keep Grinding HigherIn yesterday's trading, these typically bearish bets accounted for 60% of the 528,000 contracts crossing the tape yesterday.What's more, the Feb. put/call OI ratio has ballooned to a whopping 3.55, with puts more than tripling calls among options set to expire within the next month. Barring some news before Friday, these puts appear to be smart money on RAD stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017The postThursday's Vital Data: eBay Inc (EBAY), Amazon.com, Inc.

Is Netflix Inc. a Growth Stock or a Cult Stock?;1/25/2017;"I personally like to invest in growth stocks, butNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) has always seemed too hot to handle. The stock's   valuations never seem justified by its earnings, yet it's rallied   almost 900% over the past five years.The bulls usually call Netflix a ""growth"" stock, while many   bears call it a ""cult"" stock supported by brand awareness instead   of fundamental growth. Let's take a closer look at the streaming   giant's growth figures to see which label is better suited for   the streaming video leader.makeArticleAd();Image source: Netflix.How fast is Netflix growing?Between fiscal 2011 and 2016, Netflix's annual revenues rose   175% from  $3.2 billion to $8.8 billion. During those five   years, its total streaming subscribers worldwide climbed from   23.5 million to 93.8 million as it pivoted away from DVD-by-mail   subscriptions and expanded to overseas markets.Last quarter, Netflix's total subscriber base grew  25%   annually, fueled by 10% growth in the U.S. and 48% growth   overseas. That growth silenced critics who claimed that Netflix's   gradual increases in fees would cause its subscriber growth to   peter out. The bulls will likely claim that Netflix's robust   revenue and subscriber growth supports its price-to-sales ratio   of 6.8 -- which is more than double the industry average of    3.3 for broadcast media companies.Those numbers clearly indicate that Netflix's ecosystem is   growing, and explain why it's become synonymous with streaming   video in many markets. That's why analysts expect Netflix's   revenue to rise 27% this year and  another 20% next year.   Meanwhile, Netflix's growing portfolio of acclaimed original   shows -- likeHouse of Cards,Daredevil, andStranger Things-- are locking in subscribers and reducing its dependence on   pricey third-party content.But what about the bottom line?Netflix's revenue and subscriber growth look solid, but its   bottom line growth doesn't. Between 2011 and 2016, Netflix's net   income actually fell 17% from $226.1 million to $186.7 million   due to the rising costs of licensing third-party content, the   development of its own multi-million dollar programs, and its   aggressive expansion into overseas markets with localized   content.Image source: Netflix.But on the bright side, Netflix's operating margin has   improved over the past few quarters, rising from 3.3% to 6.2%   between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016. Netflix sees higher   revenue growth and reduced expenses boosting that figure to 9.1%   for the current quarter. Based on these bottom line improvements,   Netflix's net earnings are expected to grow 158% this year and   82% next year.Those figures sound impressive, but they don't really justify   the stock's trailing P/E of 379. Its forward P/E of 69 looks less   frothy, but it still indicates that quite a bit of its future   growth is already priced in. Investors should also note that   Netflix's heavy spending dropped its free cash flow to negative   $639 million at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to   negative $276 million in the year ago quarter.Mind the disruptive headwindsNetflix has been a disruptive force over the past decade,   first crushing movie rental giants like Blockbuster and then   skewering traditional media, cable, and advertising companies by   convincing their subscribers to ""cut their cords.""But looking ahead, Netflix is headed for head-on collisions   withTime Warner's(NYSE: TWX) HBO,Amazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video, and numerous other stand-alone   over-the-top (OTT) platforms. IfAT&T(NYSE: T) is cleared to buy Time Warner, the telecom giant could   exclude HBO Now and other streaming content fromdata chargesacross its networks -- which could force Netflix to subsidize its   users' data costs or pay AT&T for ""zero-rated"" content.Meanwhile, Amazon has aggressively expanded Prime Video with   original content to counter Netflix, bundled the platform into   its prisoner-taking Prime memberships, and even offered   stand-alone video subscriptions at lower prices than    Netflix. Amazon Video has already become the third largest   streaming video service in  North America after Netflix and   YouTube according to research firm Sandvine -- so it's certainly   well-poised to hurt the streaming leader.So is Netflix a growth stock or a cult stock?I used to consider Netflix a cult stock, but I don't think the   label is accurate anymore considering the stability of its   subscriber and revenue growth and its improving margins. Netflix   still looks pricey relative to its trailing 12 month earnings,   but its stabilizing bottom line growth indicates that it's not   that expensive relative to its future earnings growth   potential.Netflix is certainly a risky stock,   and competitive moves by Time Warner, AT&T, and   Amazon could sink it. But it's still a growth play which could   rally even higher as it locks in even more users worldwide with   well-received original shows and movies.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Why My Visit to Amazon Books was Eye-Opening;1/25/2017;"When my wife said she wanted to take a long-awaited pilgrimage   to a bookstore, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to   check outAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN)  recently opened Amazon Books concept in   San Diego. Based on my previous bookstore experiences, I expected   a sprawling big-box bookstore packed with tens of thousands of   books crammed into every available shelf space, like sardines.   What I found was a small, unassuming location with only a few   thousand titles, with space for every book. I also found   opportunities to join the Amazon ecosystem at every turn.makeArticleAd();The Amazon Books at the Westfield UTC Mall in La Jolla. Image   source: Author.A bookstoreIt's been quite some time since my last visit to a bookstore.   Years back, my family and I would go to the Borders near our home   every few months. We would browse the seemingly endless supply of   books that lined its shelves from floor to ceiling, as well as   other sections containing a variety of newspapers, music, and   movies.Customers are encouraged to join Amazon Prime. Image source:     Author.Amazon Books was quite different. There were no movies or   music. There were wide aisles without crowding, and while there   were plenty of books, there were far fewer than I had   imagined.Only the most popular titles could be found. They were   arranged with the covers facing up so that you could see each   one. Though not the most efficient use of space, it made browsing   a much less complicated experience. If a specific title was not   available, customers were reminded that it could likely be   purchased on Amazon's website.And so much moreWhat was most surprising was the wide variety of Amazon   devices in the store. These included Fire Tablets, Kindle   e-readers, and Fire TV Stick. The Echo and Echo Dot, Amazon's   interactive speaker systems with theAlexa virtual assistant, were featured prominently. Placards illustrating people using   numerous Alexa commands hung between them: ""Alexa, shuffle my   workout playlist"" and ""Alexa, find me a Chinese restaurant"" were   two such examples.Several of each of the devices were mounted on stands for   hands-on customer interaction. Amazon Basics electronic   accessories, as well as partner products that integrate with   Alexa, were available. This area covered approximately 25% of the   store.Kindle and Echo displays. Image source: Author.One employee that I spoke to indicated that this was the   store's ""discovery center."" Many customers need the experience of   touching the products, listening to them, and interacting with   them before making a purchase. This provided a safe place for   experimenting and discovery of the features, capabilities, and   benefits of the products. Kindle e-readers could also be found on   shelves among the books, displaying a nearby title, with customer   testimonials regarding their love of the product.Signs advised customers that Amazon Prime members would pay   the same prices found on the website for both books and devices.   For non-members, devices cost the same as for members, but they   paid the list price for books. Staff would helpfully suggest that   they would save on their purchases by becoming Amazon Prime   members and detailed the many additional benefits of   membership.Investor takeawayThe one thread running through the entire visit wasn't so much   that this was a bookstore, though by all outward appearances it   was. Amazon Books provided all the familiar trappings and is a   delightful bookstore in its own right -- wide aisles, top   sellers, and easy to see books make it an ideal place to while   away an afternoon. The undercurrent, though, revealed a rather   ingenious way of familiarizing customers with Amazon products and   services.This is an important, when considering the following   statistics.  Amazon estimates that Prime members spend twice   the amount of non-members, though some estimates put that number   as high as 4.6 times.  Current Prime membership is estimated   at 63 million -- more than half of US households.  The Echo   and Echo Dot have an installed base of approximately 5 million,   which also permit ease of ordering.  Customers with a   current Amazon store credit card spend 16% more than the average   Prime member.  Finally, Amazon recently introduced its new   Prime Rewards Visa card, which offers 5% back on Amazon   purchases.  Each of these is part of a coordinated   strategy aimed at increasing the number of Prime members, as   these customers are the company's most lucrative.As an investor, I think this is a brilliant strategy. The   prominent displays of its devices, the demonstrations of product   capabilities, and the regular reminders of the benefits of Prime   membership are a clever way to introduce the uninitiated to the   Amazon ecosystem.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL-QCOM Deal, FB's Zuckerberg Testifies;1/25/2017;"With the 45thPresident of the United States vowing to bring back jobs to the country, teach China a lesson and institute large-scale tax reform, there has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technology stocks. To make matters worse, President Trump has an axe to grind with AmazonAMZNand AppleAAPLwhile most AlphabetGOOGLexecutives have openly supported the democrats going into the elections.So companies are now making nice with the President like Tesla's Elon Musk, who has changed tunes and is now tweeting his support. It's been reported that Google's Schmidt has also found reasons to visit the President. Executives that have supported Trump from the start are better off: some speculate that Zuckerberg is considering politics while ex-MicrosoftMSFTand GM employee Chris Liddell is moving to the White House as assistant to the President and director of strategic initiatives. Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team in December.Then there's Cramer, promising us that the post inauguration sell-off won't last and that it's actually an opportunity to buy stocks.Amidst all the excitement surrounding the swearing in, the FTC sued QualcommQCOMfor anti-competitive practices while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchase of Oculus. So let's dig in.Apple Forced to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollowing similar lawsuits, huge fines ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetitive investigations in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Qualcomm for ""de facto exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements and that effectively foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining processor business at Apple.""The FTC alleges that Qualcomm allowed Apple billions in discounts for exclusively using its chips and not using the competing 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel was pushing. This agreement, running from 2011 to 2016, ultimately killed WiMax. Apple wasted no time in sourcing from Intel after the expiry of the agreement in Sep 2016.Another point in contention is Qualcomm's practice of limiting access to its cellular chips and then hiking royalty payments, amounting to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors."" The FTC filed the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm has of course denied the charges while Apple chose not to comment.Following the FTC lawsuit, Apple filed one of its own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Apple alleges that Qualcomm is witholding for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal was to keep Qualcomm chips in Apple products and is a fair indication that Qualcomm finally has some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deny charges that Facebook was aware of the violation of any employee agreement between Occulus head John Carmack and its former employer id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in this case. He also denied that the technology developed by the startup Occulus and its founder Palmer Luckey was based on copyrighted technology belonging to ZeniMax.Carmack previously testified that he copied files from ZeniMax before moving to Occulus but did not use the information in Occulus and the terms of his employment allowed him to get involved with Occulus even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at this point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi's question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-something billion deal was to begin legal diligence on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.09%+21.62%FB+0.33%+6.42%YHOO-0.14%+10.80%GOOGL-0.16%+9.94%MSFT+0.21%+16.26%INTC+0.63%+5.38%CSCO+0.20%+0.64%AMZN-0.65%+9.82%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateIndia Considering Apple Case: It's hard to tell just how badly India wants Apple to manufacture in the country. But if government officials agree to Apple's demands, it would indicate that they want it bad. Because Apple has asked for just about every concession possible, ranging from reduction in import duties on smartphones, customs duty exemption on manufacturing equipment and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" customs procedure to be completed in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhones that are more than 3 years old so they can be exported, and so forth.Apple is trying to convince government officials that Indian made iPhones won't be competitive unless they give in to these demands even as its manufacturing costs in China are on the rise. But Asian phone makers are already manufacturing in the country with no such concessions, so the regulations themselves may need to be altered and relaxed to accommodate not just Apple but also other manufacturers. This could take time.On a positive note, Reuters reports that Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has mentioned the setting up of a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary that would now clear investment proposals in the electronics sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments.Microsoft Executive Joins Baidu: Baidu has appointed Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer and Group Head as it turns focus to artificial intelligence as the next growth driver. The company was mixed up in a scandal involving medical ads that led to stricter government regulations and consequently hit its revenues.Lu left Microsoft last year on health concerns but was in charge of its search business and also part of the team involved in architecting its artificial intelligence and bots technology. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents.Google Ad Auctions Are Suspect: The Wall Street Journal has independently confirmed that ads for Google products and the products of its sister companies usually find the top spot on the search engine results page. On checking 25K search results, it found that Google products occupied the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spots 43% of the time.Google has said that this is because it is also a buyer of ads, so its position comes from paying a higher price. It also says that this doesn't raise prices because when others bid for the price, it's as if Google isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertisers lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it. Google reportedly removed its ads in a number of cases when confronted with the data last December.Amazon, Apple End Audiobook Exclusivity Deal: Apple and Amazon have decided to end the deal initiated back in 2008, according to which Amazon subsidiary Audible became the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to Apple and was barred from selling to any other party. The agreement was actually serving no one because the market for audiobooks has advanced since then and it's now in the interest of both parties to be able to source from others and in Audible's case, to also be able to sell on other platforms. Nonetheless, it was preceded by regulatory scrutiny of the deal by German and EU competition authorities that felt it was inflating prices.Pandora Shares Gain: Pandora preannounced fourth-quarter results that it said exceeded its revenue and EBITDA targets. This came as a relief because it has been lowering expectations the last two quarters indicating continuing bad news. Moreover, Pandora also said that the $5-a-month Pandora Plus garnered 365K new subscribers in the quarter and the Pandora Premium service remained on track to launch later this quarter. It also expects to lay off around 7% of the U.S. workforce, which will further boost margins.Legal/RegulatoryCisco-Arista Developments: The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has expressed concern that its earlier decision to lift the ban on Arista switches may have been incorrect. Following conversations with CiscoCSCO, the CBP therefore intends to reinstate the ban. Arista has said that it will respond to Cisco points and re-engage with the CBP.In the meantime, U.S.-manufactured switches will have to make do, which can result in supply glitches and pressure on its gross margin. On Dec 2, the ITC judge ruled that Arista patents infringe on Cisco's and Arista has subsequently produced workaround while denying the charges. A full commission review of the judge's decision will be completed by Apr 9.New Technology/ProductsGoogle to Launch Android One Phones In U.S.: Google's high-end Pixel phones are mostly unavailable, but it's already gearing up to launch the low-end ($200-$300) Android One devices in the country by the middle of the year. The goal seems to be to build brand value and familiarize people with the Android ecosystem.Android One was first launched in India and later in other countries including Japan and then Europe. It is a system under which Google agrees beforehand with handset manufacturers to push out Android updates as soon as they are available so the experience is true to the latest iteration of the software.M&A and CollaborationsHPE Buying Simplivity: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is dishing out $650 million to buy SimpliVity, the second largest provider of hyperconvergence software (after Nutanix which has over 50% market share). The company describes a hyperconverged system as one that integrates compute, storage and networking into a pre-configured system, managed by a user-friendly software platform that doesn't require extensive IT staff for set up and management.Within a couple of months after the deal closes, HPE will offer a range of integrated HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged systems based on HPE ProLiant Servers. The acquisition significantly strengthens its position in the space where competitors like Cisco and Dell/EMC base their hyperconvergence solutions on market leader Nutanix or Simplivity software. HPE will initially support current SimpliVity customers.Cisco, Ericsson Join Forces in Australia: The collaboration between Ericsson and Cisco on telecom cloud infrastructure has yielded a major customer in Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA). The companies will virtualize Vodafone's infrastructure, enabling it to improve customer service and user experience while increasing network agility, reducing opex and capex, and speeding up the deployment of services. The partnership has reportedly generated 60 new deals and is expected to generate revenue of a billion dollars to each partner by 2018.Microsoft Acquires Simplygon: Microsoft has acquired 3D data optimization specialist Simplygon of Sweden for an undisclosed sum. This is intended to play an important role in developing its 3D For Everyone strategy, which is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. 3D optimization is used by game developers and others to facilitate 3D content creation.Simplygon also does more than this: it has already started optimizing content for AR and VR technology, including for Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft believes that by making the technology a part of its creators update, users will be empowered to capture, create and share 3D content thus augmenting their productivity, collaboration and creativity.Google Buys Twitter Developers Platform: Google has acquired Fabric, which is based on Crashlytics technology (crash analytics, app feedback and real-time analytics) that Twitter acquired back in 2013. Google hasn't said how much it's paying for Fabric, but has said that it will be a part of its cloud based mobile software effort called Firebase that was itself acquired in 2014. Firebase offers mobile app developers tools to build and monitor their apps, so any attempt to build its capabilities should help the company attract developers.Alibaba Has Long-term Digital Deal: Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a deal, according to which Alibaba will be responsible for the IOC's digital presence through its cloud platform. The deal makes Alibaba the digital sponsor of the Olympics in cloud services, e-commerce and television for a period running through 2028. While immediate returns may not there, this lends credibility to the service and should help Alibaba win big customer accounts.WDC Considering Toshiba Stake: Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba is looking to spin off or sell off a 20% stake in its chip business in which case Western Digital might be the one picking it up. Toshiba is in trouble right now as it has to deal with an unprofitable nuclear business and accounting scandal that requires it to cough up some cash. Selling off a share to its longtime partner Western Digital (the two operate a flash memory fab in Japan) might be just the answer it needs.Some NumbersUK App Store Prices Up: As a result of the pound's continued declines, Apple has been compelled to raise App store prices by as much as 25%.Intel Invests in Retail Tech: At the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York, Intel said that it intended to invest $100 million in retail technology over the next five years. It also announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, which uses a combination of sensors, software kits and other hardware solutions to provide ""in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home"".Companies That Reported Results Last Week: CHKP, NFLX, PLXS, IBM, SWKSSome Companies Reporting This Week: CA, XLNX, FFIV, DST, AVT, YHOO, TXN, BABA, EBAY, LRCX, TER, GOOGL, KLAC, PYPL, IBM, SWKS, SIMO, GLW, STX, WDC, INTC, MSFT, JNPR, AMCC, VMW, SYNAZacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   ProfitToday you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Alibaba Earnings Takeaways: Strong Growth Across Segments;1/25/2017;"Alibaba(BABA) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings on January 24, reporting a 54% year-over-year increase in revenues to RMB 53.2 billion. The massive revenue growth was similar to results from the March, June and September quarters, with new acquisitions driving much of the top line growth. Alibaba acquired online video streaming platform Youku Tudou in November 2015 and Singaporean e-commerce giant Lazada in April 2016, which drove Digital Media and International Retail Commerce revenues, respectively. Additionally, Alibaba's core commerce and cloud business continued to grow at a strong pace through the December quarter - similar to the trend observed all year.We have a revised$99 price estimate for Alibaba's stock, which is roughly in line with the current market price. Alibaba's stock price rose from $88 at the end of last year to around $101 currently.makeArticleAd();See our complete analysis for AlibabaStrong Revenue Growth Across DivisionsIn addition to inorganic growth in Digital Media and International Retail segments, Alibaba reported a massive 115% annual increase in Cloud Computing revenues to RMB 1.8 billion for the December quarter. As a result, full year Alibaba Cloud revenues were up almost 140% y-o-y to RMB 5.6 billion. The growth in revenues was largely due to a more than 100% increase in the total number of paying customers for cloud computing and internet infrastructure offerings from 313,000 customers in September quarter last year to 765,000 this year. This number is expected to increase given the huge demand for internet infrastructure across China and other Asian markets. As a result, we expect strong growth in Cloud Computing revenues for Alibaba in the coming years. (Read more: Amazon Vs. Alibaba: Cloud Services In Focus)Alibaba's core e-commerce business includes websites Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasua, and has provided consistent growth for the company over the last few years, with revenues growing from RMB 24 billion in 2012 to RMB 75 billion in 2015. This segment witnessed a sustained period of growth, with Q3 FY'17 revenues rising by 42% y-o-y to RMB 42.6 billion. Similarly, full year revenues were up 43% to RMB 112.3 billion (or around $16.5 billion at current exchange rates).In the December quarter, Alibaba's online retail segment in China was boosted by an 9% increase in annual active buyers and a 25% increase in mobile monthly active users (MAUs) to 443 million and 493 million, respectively. Additionally, the revenue per buyer (particularly for mobile users) has also surged on a year-over-year basis as shown below.In terms of operating profits, Alibaba's adjusted EBITDA grew by 43% year-over-year to RMB 70.1 billion for the year. The rate of growth of operating profit was slightly lower than revenue growth since the company invested heavily in its smaller non-commerce segments. For instance, Alibaba is spending a lot on developing platforms for cloud computing, acquiring traffic for the online video and music segments, and investing in content and production with a longer term view. As a result, the smaller divisions operate at a loss, as shown in the table. While the margins of the loss-making divisions have improved, it could take a year or two for these divisions to become profitable. As a result, the company-wide margins can improve in the long run given the relatively low variable costs, due to which its operating leverage will remain high.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"
Which Streaming Service Has the Most-Satisfied Customers?;1/25/2017;"Americans remain somewhat divided on their favorite streaming   service, but they have a clear pick when it comes to which one   they like the least. A newreportfrom Strategy Analytics measured customer satisfaction in 14   categories across three key areas: the number and availability of   TV shows/films, how easy it is to find them, and the overall   value of the service.Time Warner's(NYSE: TWX) HBO Now won the most categories, taking 11 out of   14, butNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) received the highest score when it came to overall   satisfaction.Both Netflix and HBO Now can stake a claim as having the top   service, and Hulu made a strong case for third place, beating   Netflix in six of 14 categories and scoring top marks in   children's programming. Amazon Prime, however, consistently   brought up the rear, ranking last in all 14 categories among the   four services rated.""HBO Now has successfully positioned itself as a go-to-service   for quality programs, especially movies,"" said Strategy Analytics   analyst Zhaowen Wu in the press release. ""Though HBO Now has a   much smaller library than other SVOD [subscription video on   demand] services, it has more blockbuster movies and hit series   such as Game of Thrones and Westworld.""makeArticleAd();Image source: Strategy Analytics.HBO is the big winnerHBO's stand-alone streaming service was a late entry to the   field, first launching in April 2015. The company was late to the   party because it did not want to upset its cable partners, which   had long sold the channel as a premium service. That legacy as a   cable product may be the only reason Netflix scored a victory in   overall customer satisfaction, according to Strategy Analytics   Digital Media Strategies Director Michael Goodman.""When considering the bigger picture, Netflix clearly benefits   from its brand 'halo' while HBO Now suffers from a negative   association with cable's legacy issues,"" he said. ""However, once   one gets into the weeds, the reality is that HBO subscribers are   the most satisfied with nearly all elements that make up a strong   SVOD service.""Goodman did point out that the overall difference in scores is   relatively small. He also explained that while Amazon was the   clear loser in the report, the fact that the video service is   just one element of the company's Prime membership means its   members ""may actually be the least likely to churn, particularly   as they're the most likely to have household incomes above   $100,000.""Netflix ranked highest for overall satisfaction. Image source:   Netflix.Which services will people get?HBO Now costs more than any of its rivals at $14.99 a month.   Hulu costs $7.99 with commercials or $11.99 without while Netflix   charges $9.99 a month, and Prime costs $99 a year (or it can be   purchased for $10.99 a month) and includes other perks like free   two-day shipping. Goodman acknowledged that many consumers will   buy more than one streaming subscription, but he sees HBO as   potentially emerging as the top choice.""People have been talking about it being a Netflix vs. Amazon   battle in terms of which service viewers choose, with the others   left to pick up the scraps,"" he said. ""However, if HBO continues   on this vein, we're more likely to see a situation where people   will have one 'blockbuster' service like HBO or HBO Now and   either a Netflix or Amazon in support.""That interpretation would ring more true if Netflix did not   already have 47.91 million U.S. subscribers, a gain of nearly 2   million paying customers in Q4. Time Warner does not report HBO   Now subscribers, but the number was estimated at about 1 million   in March 2016. That's not a representative picture of how many   people are watching because HBO still has tens of millions of   traditional cable subscribers.There will be more than one winnerWhat's clear from this report is that both HBO and Netflix are   considered top-tier streaming services by consumers while Prime   and Hulu sit at least a slight tick below. In a market where   people are dropping cable subscriptions that cost more than $100   a month on average, it seems likely that both HBO and Netflix can   be winners.In fact, given how closely these scores are grouped and the   fact that the key driver for many Prime customers is free   shipping, it's possible that all four of these services will   continue to grow. Paying for all four would cost $45.22 a month   (prorated for paying $99 for Prime all at once) and it can be   argued that just getting all four costs well less than cable   while offering a comparable, if not a better, array of   entertainment is a big win.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in India;1/25/2017;"On Wednesday,AppleAAPLexecutives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think AmazonAMZNand NetflixNFLX-Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amazon.com, Inc. Earnings: Will Big Investments Weigh on Profitability?;1/25/2017;"On the heels of a nice 37% gain in the company's stock price   in the past twelve months, the pressure is on forAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) to deliver strongly when the e-commerce and   cloud-computing giant reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday,   Feb. 2. Ahead of the quarterly update, here's a brief overview of   what to watch when Amazon posts its earnings release.Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();Amazon.com results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016 GuidanceQ4 2015Net sales$42 billion to $45.5 billion$35.7 billionOperating income$0 to $1.25 billion$1.1 billionData source: Amazon's third-quarter 10-Q filing.For Amazon's fourth quarter, management expects the company to   post strong revenue growth. Management's guidance implies revenue   growth will be between 17% and 27%.However, even the high end of the guidance for net sales falls   short of the growth rate Amazon's net sales achieved in the third   quarter, when revenue was up 29% year over year. It's possible,   therefore, that Amazon is lowballing its guidance range, and   revenue is more likely to be in the high end of this range.Amazon's expectations for fourth-quarter operating income are   where the most uncertainty for the quarter lies. Big investments   in international markets, fulfillment-center and warehouse   openings, digital content, and various Prime benefits are   expected to drive operating expenses higher.Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky explained the upward trajectory for   the company's investments in the company's third-quarter earnings   call:What you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this     year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content     and also the fulfillment center investment -- but also things     like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to,     India and AWS as we add people there to support additional     service, rapid growth in that business.But if revenue growth comes in at the high end of Amazon's   guidance, the negative impact of these expenses on Amazon's   results won't be as noticeable, hence the wide expected range for   fourth-quarter operating income. Of course, this relationship   between revenue growth and operating income raises the stakes for   Amazon's revenue growth.Other key areas to watchBeyond revenue and operating income, investors should look for   an update on Amazon's Echo products and the company's   cloud-computing segment.Amazon's voice-activated smart speakers were hot gifts this   holiday season. Both the Echo and Echo Dot sold out before   Christmas despite Amazon's ""best efforts and ramped-up   production."" Furthermore, the company said record-setting orders   of Amazon Echo family products increased 900% over last year's   holiday season. With sales of the product skyrocketing, investors   should watch for an update on how Echo is impacting Amazon's   business.Cloud computing. Image source: Getty Images.Probably the most important item to watch when Amazon reports   results will be its Amazon Web Services, or its pay-as-you-use   cloud-computing offerings, including database storage,   application platforms, and other information technology   resources. Together these account for about 75% of Amazon's   operating profits, so investors are counting on AWS to serve as a   long-term growth driver for the company.

Apple Earnings Strategy: When To Buy AAPL Shares;1/25/2017;"Apple will release earnings soon (Shutterstock photo)Apple (AAPL) will release their earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 next Tuesday, and the guessing game has begun. It used to be that analysts would wait until they had seen the numbers before opining or changing any rating on Apple stock. In part that was because up until last year, the company continually made those analysts look foolish by beating every quarter’s estimates by huge margins.That meant that investors who bought the stock in the run up to earnings invariably benefited, and analysts would rush to upgrade forecasts once the extent of the beat was known. However, the recent slowdown in growth has changed the dynamic somewhat.makeArticleAd();Now it seems that the competition among those that cover AAPL is to see who can come out with the gloomiest earnings prediction, and who can downgrade the earliest. Over the past week two big names, Barclays and Stifel have downgraded AAPL in front of earnings, both citing worries about i-Phone 7 sales.This kind of focus on potential and actual negatives surrounding Apple’s earnings has changed the way retail investors should approach the release too. With such negativity abounding the stock is likely to lose ground as earnings approach, and/or to react to anything but a spectacular report in a negative, or at best muted, manner.Far from buying in front of the release, then, waiting until afterwards makes sense this time around. That assumes that buying AAPL at all would be a good idea; an assumption not everybody will be comfortable with. The negative slant to coverage that makes it likely that you will be able to pick up AAPL cheap next week will also put off some people, but a look at the facts and prospects should reassure you.First, let’s look at the stock’s actual performance. If you listen to the naysayers they would have you believe that AAPL has underperformed recently. The reality, though, as demonstrated by the chart below comparing AAPL to the Nasdaq tracking ETF,QQQover the last six months, is completely different. During that time AAPL has outperformed its benchmark by a factor of 3, gaining 24% compared to the index’s 8%.Appreciation in AAPL though, as with any stock, is about what will happen in the future rather than what has happened in the past, but there are a few reasons to be optimistic on that front too. As I wrotea few weeks ago, my personal experience suggests that demand for the Apple Watch series 2 is greater than anybody expected, with a fair amount of pent up demand resulting from widespread shortages of the product in the holiday buying season.In addition, even those anticipating lower than expected iPhone sales have noted that the higher priced 7 Plus has proven more popular than expected, which should benefit the bottom line.All of that is positive, but what investors are really looking for is for Apple to do something spectacular again in order to re-invigorate the whole ecosystem. Their recent decision to start commissioning original content for Apple TV offers the possibility of that. Content production is, of course, a very crowded field right now, and a difficult business at the best of times, but Apple has a huge advantage over others that might try to break into the market: over $200 billion in cash.As Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have shown, it only takes one or two hits to be successful in this area and with the ability to absorb a few failures, betting against Apple succeeding would seem to be foolish.Add in a decent and growing dividend and buying or adding to holdings of AAPL is a good idea. With that said, though, the fact that the conventional wisdom seems to be that this will be a disappointing earnings release for the company makes patience in this case a virtue, and waiting until after next Tuesday’s report is a risk that should pay off."
If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;1/25/2017;"Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();If I could only buy one stock right now, then there are a few   boxes that stock needs to check. I'd like the holding to be   relatively safe in a tumultuous time but still look likely to   generate modest short-term growth, while having the potential for   exceptional long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a   robust balance sheet and be relatively cheap in this expensive   market -- and is a little dividend too much to ask?For all of that, look no further thanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Short-term growth prospects look goodApple's finances are massive in almost every way, with sales   in the fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sales and   earnings actually slowed during the during quarter, down 9% and   19%, respectively, but the company has guided for a return to   sales growth in fiscal Q1.Some Apple bears have pointed to the company's reliance on its   iPhone -- which made up about two-thirds of sales in the most   recent quarter -- and that those sales are starting to slow as   the phone seems to be saturating the addressable market. The   average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone segment has fallen   slightly year over year.However, the iPhone could have plenty of growth left. The new   iPhone 7 launched in late 2016 seems to be performing very well   already and should help to boost ASP once again. Additionally,   the issues with the explodingSamsungGalaxy Note 7, which has even been banned on all U.S.   aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhone sales the highest   yet.Image source: Apple.The bears also point to nascent growth in most of Apple's   other products, such as its personal computers, iPads, and the   Apple Watch. One other area that's growing impressively is the   services segment, which includes revenue from services such as   iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Pay. This segment's revenue grew 24%   year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, making up 13%   of total revenue as Apple's second largest segment by sales   behind the iPhone segment. Services are increasingly important,   as the total number of Apple products in use continues to grow   each quarter, meaning more devices that are likely linked to an   Apple account and could help services revenue to continue growing   nicely.Apple's robust financial positionWhile Apple's sales and earnings have come under pressure, its   cash growth has not. Apple's operating cash flow in the most   recent quarter surged to $16 billion, a new company record for   that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the company   has grown its total cash and investments to $238 billion, more   than a third of its market cap, and aboutdouble the next wealthiest company in the United   States.Unfortunately for Apple's capital expenditure advocates, about   90% of that money is stored out of the U.S., as the company has   resisted paying heavy repatriation taxes to bring it back home.   However, President Trump has signaled that he'd like to offer a   much lower tax rate, maybe as low as 10%, for companies in   Apple's position that are seeking to send huge chunks of money   home. There are certainly other risks for Apple in some of   Trump's proposed tax ideas, such as potential import tariffs on   goods manufactured overseas, but this one point is important for   what it could mean for Apple's cash available for immediate   use.Long-term growth potentialApple's new wireless headphones, called ""air pods."" Image     source: Apple.Apple's modest short-term growth on continued incremental   innovations and execution is encouraging, but it's much more fun   to consider Apple's moonshot long-term growth possibilities.   Apple increased its research and development spend by about 25%   to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.Speaking of the company's huge cash position, there are a few   fun reckless predictions we can make about what the company might   spend that money on developing. Self-driving cars, virtual   and augmented reality, and more recently original content for   iTunes are all areas of growth that tech industry analysts are   looking for from Apple.My favorite reckless prediction is that Apple will begin   competing more heavily in artificial intelligence. Apple's Siri   was one of the first voice-based search tools beforeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) entered the space with their smart   home voice-activated devices.Amazon and Google beat Apple to market with their home   assistant devices, but Apple isn't known for being an early   market mover -- rather, Apple has a knack for swooping in with   amazing products that in turn dominate the market that's already   there. Let's not forget that Amazon and Google have ventured into   Apple's world with their consumer electronics much more than   Apple would be venturing into theirs with its own artificial   intelligence assistant.WhyApple stockstill looks like a great buyFinally, in terms of valuation, Apple still looks cheap. Even   though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it's still   trading at just 14 times earnings. Compare that with around 25   times earnings on average for the S&P 500, Google at 30, and   Amazon at 185. Also, Apple stock has run up quickly lately, but   it's still down from its high of around $135 in mid-2015, so its   recent run doesn't look unreasonable.Add to that a relatively cheap valuation, as well as all of   the points covered here, that Apple stock also pays a 2% dividend   yield, which could very well rise as Apple deploys more of its   huge cash load in 2017. The best investment strategy is one   that's well diversified, but for all of those points -- if I   could only buy one stock, Apple continues to look like a great   stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

What's Behind Netflix's Massive Subscriber Additions;1/24/2017;"Image Source: NetflixIt's been 10 years sinceNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) launched its video-streaming service, and it just   added the most new subscribers ever in a quarter. The   streaming-video leader added 7.05 million total new subscribers   -- 1.93 million in the U.S., 5.12 million internationally --   bringing its total to almost 94 million.Not only did those numbers exceed Netflix's and analysts'   expectations, they represented a significant recovery from poor   net addition numbers in the second and third quarters. In fact,   Netflix added more subscribers in the fourth quarter than the   second and third quarters combined. So, what factors led to   Netflix's massive subscriber additions?makeArticleAd();The end of the great un-grandfatheringDuring the second and third quarters, longtime Netflix   subscribers saw their monthly rates increase from $8 or $9 per   month to $10 per month. Netflix had un-grandfathered 75% of   subscribers by the end of the third quarter. Importantly, those   un-grandfathered in the fourth quarter saw just a $1 increase,   while most of the earlier price increases were $2.Netflix noted that subscriber churn increased more than   expected in the second quarter, and it clearly remained elevated   in the third quarter. However, management also told investors   that gross additions remained in line with expectations. In the   fourth quarter, it seems churn rates returned to normal   levels.What's most telling is the amount Netflix spent on marketing,   particularly in the U.S. Marketing expenses actually declined   compared to the third quarter, but Netflix managed to add five   times as many subscribers. Unless Netflix made some drastic   changes in marketing last quarter (it didn't), its gross adds   have likely remained relatively stable (with adjustments for   seasonality).It's also worth noting that some customers who left over the   Summer may have rejoined last quarter. Netflix's constant stream   of new releases makes it difficult to stay away from it once   you've gotten used to it.Pulling forward some subscribersNetflix's outlook for the first quarter is about in line with   analysts' expectations, but it expects a little less from the   U.S. and a little more from the rest of the world. In its letter   to shareholders, management wrote, ""We believe our strong Q4   results likely pulled forward some net adds from Q1'17 to   Q4'16.""To be clear, that's not a bad thing. The sooner people sign   up, the sooner Netflix starts making money off of them. But   it does mean investors should temper their expectations for the   first quarter, especially with the new season ofHouse of Cardsbeing pushed back into the second quarter.A new high-revenue subscriber baseNow that Netflix customers are all paying higher rates, the   company should continue to add subscribers at a more steady pace.   Netflix said its average sales price per U.S. subscriber was up   15% last quarter thanks to its price increase. As a result,   domestic revenue increased 27%, while the subscriber base   increased just 10%.Netflix will face more pressure on international growth this   year now that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) launched Prime Instant Video   globally. What's more,Amazon is undercutting Netflix's pricingin most countries, which could constrain Netflix's ability to   keep increasing its prices.Netflix may respond by shifting some of its marketing budget   from the U.S. to its International division. Of course, it will   also continue investing in new originals and licensed content for   its international audience. But Amazon has the marketing and   content budget to keep up with Netflix.Whether that impacts Netflix's ability to continue growing its   subscriber base or raise prices remains to be seen. It certainly   hasn't had a huge impact in the United States, where Amazon also   undercuts Netflix's pricing.Last quarter's results show that Netflix might experience a   few hiccups as it raises prices, but it's capable of getting back   on track quickly.Find out why Netflixis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

The Problem With Apple's TV Ambitions;1/24/2017;"Image Source: Motley Fool.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has toyed with the idea of entering the television   industry for what seems like ages now. Since it unveiled the   original Apple TV in 2007, the company has considered   manufacturing its own television set, putting together a ""skinny   bundle,"" and even, according to pundits, making an offer for a   company likeNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) .makeArticleAd();Apple has long had a foothold in music ever since it launched   iTunes, and television could bring the same complementary   benefits to its ecosystem. Apple already sells many of the   devices used to consume streaming video, and technology has   tipped the entertainment scales toward tech companies rather than   traditional media players. After Netflix, e-commerce giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has made the biggest splash in streaming.Now Apple wants to join the herd, producing its own original   shows. According toTheWall Street Journal, the company has been in talks with producers to make its own   programming, which would be available to subscribers of its   $10/month music-streaming service. The company hopes to launch   such programming by the end of 2017.However, while it seems natural for Apple to have ambitions in   TV, diving straight into original programming could present a   number of challenges for the company.1. Profits are thinAfter years of breakneck international expansion, Netflix is   finally set to deliver its first year of ""material profits"" since   2011, when it split its streaming service from its DVD-by-mail   business after years of operating at breakeven. Amazon,   meanwhile, doesn't break out figures for its streaming service,   and essentially gives it away to its Prime members, using its   content as a carrot to entice more people to shop on its   website.The point is that video streaming is no one's idea of a cash   cow at this point. The services are so cheap, at about $10/month,   that a company needs to generate a substantial base before hoping   to make a profit. Netflix, for example, is set to top 100 million   subscribers this year, but it took the company years to get to   that point. Apple could operate the service at a loss, but that   seems contrary to the company's high-margin business model. With   more than $45 billion in net income in its last fiscal year, it's   going to take more than a small video streaming service to move   the needle.2. Where's the expertise?Apple is a device-maker. Its brand and its profits come from   making hardware like the iPhone, iPad, and the Mac. Developing   and shopping for TV shows is outside of its core competencies,   and because iTunes has languished over the years, it lacks the   detailed data that competitors like Netflix have on customer   preferences.Analysts dismissed Netflix's initial ambitions in original   programming, but the company's vast database guided it when it   chose to remake the British seriesHouse of Cards, as it recognized that its subscribers had a penchant for   political dramas and actor Kevin Spacey. That show would be the   first of several hit series for Netflix.Amazon may have had to start more from scratch, though it had   its own a la carte streaming service before getting into   originals. That company's culture also prizes innovation,   risk-taking, and failure, and it launched its original   programming in 2013, giving it a significant head start over   Apple. Thanks to its Prime subscriber base, the company quickly   found an audience for its shows. In comparison, Apple under Tim   Cook seems more content to leverage its current assets and   products into new revenue streams rather than build fresh   ones.If Apple wishes to give away original programming to its Apple   Music subscribers, it may be able to build viewership like Amazon   did. But Apple doesn't have the same interest in adding perks to   Apple Music the way Amazon does with Prime. Ultimately, the   company needs to find a way to grow profits, and original TV   seems unlikely to do that either directly or indirectly as its   impact on hardware sales would probably be limited.Apple's track record in television so far also bodes poorly   for its ambitions, as the company seems unclear of its ultimate   goal and is unable to successfully negotiate with media partners.   With its hardware sales stalling, Apple has increasingly turned   to services like Apple Music or Apple Pay, but the relationship   between its devices and TV seems tenuous at best. Rather than   entering the increasingly competitive media environment, the   company would be better off leading with its strength, directly   investing in research and development that would advance hardware   sales or develop its next blockbuster product..10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Top 5 Brands Millennials Love to Love;1/24/2017;"Market research firmMBLMhas released its latest Brand Intimacy Report, which measures the   emotional attachment consumers have to various brands. The study   reveals that a strong connection is a key ingredient to a better   relationship with customers. This translates to better results   for the company over the long term, and likely will have a   positive effect on its stock price.There's additional evidence that these customers are willing   to pay a premium for those preferred brands. Let's look at the   brands that have the strongest attachments for millennials and   why.makeArticleAd();Total Return Pricedata byYCharts.Nintendo enjoys a resurgence. Image source:Pixabay.5. Nintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) . Having grown up with Nintendo, millennials   have an emotional attachment to the company and its games. The   first of the millennials were just old enough to begin playingSuper Mario Brotherswhen it launched in late 1985, and continued with fan favorites   likeZelda,Final Fantasy,Tetris, andPokemon. Nintendo acknowledged those ties last year in a Father's Day   press release, saying, ""For dads today, especially the   millennials, Nintendo was a big part of their childhood.""Not content to rest on its laurels, the company is enjoying a   resurgence with the popularity ofPokemon Go, its mobile augmented-reality game, which sends users on a   virtual scavenger hunt for its characters. In its most recent   quarter, Nintendo reported hardware sales that rose 19% over the   previous year, and reports indicate that the release of the   next-generation game is imminent.Millennials just want their technology to work. Image     source: Author.4. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Most millennials would have just been entering   their earning years with the release of the iPhone in 2007. The   introduction of the iPod six years earlier and it's 80% market   share provided a perfect transition.Research shows that, as a group, millennials are the most   dependent on their phones. Over 78% of millennials use their   phones more than two hours per day, 80% reach for their phones   first thing, and 87% report that their phones never leave their   sides.Millennials have grown up with technology and expect it to   work, so dependability is important to them.Reader's Digestcalled iPhones the most trusted mobile phone brand for 2016. That   level of familiarity, coupled with reliability, breeds a certain   attachment.Netflix and chill. Image source: Netflix.3. Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) . Netflix is becoming the new normal, and nowhere   is that more apparent than among millennials. As a group, this   demographic was born in the information age and is more tech   savvy than previous generations, so streaming Netflix is a   natural.In the decade since Netflix began streaming, it has been   embraced by the generation that now outnumbers baby boomers.   MBLM's Managing Partner Mario Natarelli said, ""We found that   escapist brands performed especially well -- mostly in the media   and entertainment industry -- due to...the need for distraction,   control and enjoyment."" Netflix and chill, baby. Netflix and   chill.Placing web orders is a cinch. Image source: Amazon.2. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Millennials grew up watching their parents order   items in the little smiley boxes, and now embrace it themselves.   Placing orders from a website, or on a mobile app, is a cinch for   this tech-comfortable bunch. Previous studies have shown   millennials view Amazon as their most relevant brand, as   well. It applies as an escapist play in the same manner as   Netflix, via its Prime streaming service.Millennials' social networking proclivities play a part, as   they share their product opinions, and solicit the views of   others. This plays directly to Amazon's DNA of customer reviews.   As consumers, millennials also collaborate with the brands they   connect with, and according to studies, they believe that   Amazon has the best customer service.The Happiest Place on Earth! Image source: Author.1. Disney(NYSE: DIS) . As much as any other company on the list, Disney   taps into the nostalgia of millennials, while remaining a part of   their present. From the young stars on the Disney channel to some   of millenials' comic book favorites coming to life on the big   screen, Disney has always been there.According to Mario Natarelli, MBLM's managing partner, ""Disney   resonates with this age group because they grew up with the   brand. It has kept up with their changing interests and now   includes popular franchises likeStar Warsand Marvel... Disney is also a mainstay for young families.""Millennials, as a group, feel strongly about their values, as   well as the companies they interact with.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview: Pixel & Home Could Fuel Growth;1/24/2017;"As per usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.In fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.The Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple'sAAPLiPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon'sAMZNEcho speaker.More importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft'sMSFTCortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.Also, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""All of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.Heading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Why 2017 Will Be the Year of the Virtual Assistant;1/24/2017;"In its annual mobile apps survey, Research firm Gartner   predicted that by 2019 virtual assistants will account for20% of all smartphone interactions. With that level of user engagement,  predictably all of   the largest technology companies are invested in the segment and   each brings a different strength to the field.Will 2017 be the year of the virtual assistant?  Image   source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.com.AmazonMany media reports  are callingAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa the hit of the Consumer Electronics Show.    In 2015, Amazon made a skills kit available to developers   that allowed partners to incorporate voice commands. Fast forward   to 2017 and Alexa can integrate with an estimated 5,000   third-party apps,  from refrigerators to TV's, from cars to   vacuums, and lest we forget, the Echo smart home speaker.    The novelty of this device made it among the top selling   items on Amazon's website during the holidays. This was a   brilliant strategic move by a company without a smartphone as an   installed base. Amazon does, however, have a roster of well-known   companies in its corner including Ford, Samsung and LG to name a   few. In addition to product integration, Alexa can be found in a   dizzying number of bots that can order a pizza from Domino's,   schedule an Uber, or check your Capital One balance. This gives   Amazon the early lead in terms of reach and momentum, but the   lack of a mobile device means that challenges remain.Apple's Siri. Image source: Apple.AppleApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , represented in the category by Siri, hasn't seen   much love. Her earliest incarnation could only answer correctly   about 65% of the time,  and users complained that far too   often she defaulted to Google rather than answering the question.   Consumers tend to remember those early first experiences, and   Siri still has a bad reputation. She shouldn't be counted out   yet, though. Apple has been taking steps to improve Siri's   understanding. In mid-2014, Siri's brain was replaced by an   artificial intelligence (AI) based neural network and Apple   claims that Siri now has a less than 5% error rate. Apple argues   that it isn't necessary to upload all of your data to the cloud   in order for Siri to improve. It uses a technique called   differential privacy, which keeps individual information at the   local phone level and protects user privacy.  Though it   currently doesn't have a, Echo-like voice-activated speaker,reports indicatethat a prototype is currently in the testing stage.Google Home powered by Google Assistant. Image source:     Google.AlphabetAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has introduced Google   Assistant, which expands on the capabilities of Google Now and OK   Google. This assistant is currently available on its Pixel phones   and can be accessed on other smartphones via the Google Allo app.   This virtual helper is more conversational and has produced   impressive early results due to experiences gained from its   predecessors. It was found to rival and in many cases surpass its   nearest competitors. Assistant's greatest strength may be the   ability to answer follow-up questions, a feature many of its   rivals lack. Integration with Google Home smart speaker puts it   squarely in competition with Amazon's Echo. Its strengths include   entire home synchronized audio and grouping of smart-home   commands.Some researchersbelieve that Alexa will cede its early lead in the category to   Google Assistant by 2020.Microsoft Cortana. Image source: Microsoft.MicrosoftMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Cortana is available across its Windows 10-based   devices including phones, tablets and PC's. It has many competing   features, but has exhibited difficulties responding to requests,   reminiscent of Siri's early days. Microsoft announced late last   year that it would open Cortana to third party integration, so   expect a number of hardware integrations on the horizon. It has   yet to introduce an interactive speaker, but its first hardware   partner is Harman Kardon and one is expected sometime this year.    In a shrewd move, the kit used by developers is remarkably   similar to that of Alexa, allowing them to piggyback off the work   they have already done. This will accelerate the process of   producing hardware that will integrate Cortana.Near-ubiquitous technologyThose interested in a task-based comparison between the four   might findthis articlebyBusiness Insiderof interest. Despite the varying capabilities among these   entries, one thing is clear: nearly every person with a computer,   tablet, smartphone, or home speaker system will have access to a   virtual personal assistant in the coming year. With this level of   exposure, consumers will begin to adopt these virtual assistants,   and as the technology becomes more advanced, providers will find   new, more innovative ways to incorporate them into our everyday   lives. Society is still in the early stages of the adoption cycle   for these digital helpers, but it appears that this year is the   tipping point.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

"Alibaba's ""New Retail"" Concept Threatens Amazon's Global Dominance";1/24/2017;"Alibaba GroupBABAimpressed investors with the release of its financial results for the December quarter on Tuesday. The Chinese e-commerce giant posted revenue growth of 54% year-over-year, and while its traditional business performed well on the back of a solid Singles' Day, the real story was the growth of Alibaba's newer segments.Financial ResultsAlibaba posted earnings of $1.09 per share and revenues of $7.669 billion, which surpassed our consensus estimates of $0.85 per share and $7.483 billion. Revenues from core commerce increased 45% year-over-year to $6.708 billion, while revenues from Alibaba's cloud computing and digital media and entertainment units grew 115% and 273%, respectively.(Also Read:Here's Why Alibaba Stock Popped After   Earnings)Alibaba's biggest competitor in the world is clearly AmazonAMZN, which holds a uniquely different share of the e-commerce market; nevertheless, the actual head-to-head battle between Amazon and Alibaba will continue to heat up as both companies look to grow internationally.For Alibaba, this solid growth in cloud computing and digital media is a good sign for its ongoing war with Amazon. It goes without saying that these segments are answers to Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video, so it must be encouraging for Alibaba investors to see the Chinese giant also succeeding in these endeavors.However, Alibaba's biggest threat to Amazon could be something mentioned further down the report.""New Retail""The fight between Alibaba and Amazon may actually come down to Alibaba's ""New Retail"" concept. According to Alibaba's earnings report, New Retail is a strategy that will allow the company to ""tap into the entire US$4.8 trillion retail sector in China by eliminating the distinction between online and offline commerce.""To execute this plan, Alibaba is partnering with several brick-and-mortar retailers. The company detailed its new relationships with a pair of retailers in the report, and it looks like Alibaba is really putting some serious cash into the idea.Alibaba's first partnership was with Sanjiang Shopping Club, a leading neighborhood grocery chain in the Zhejiang Province. In November, Alibaba scooped up a 35% stake in the chain for $302 million, and now Sanjiang will pilot a new shopping format powered by Alibaba's technology.Alibaba also detailed its $2.6 billion offer for a controlling stake in Intime Retail Group, an operator of department stores and shopping malls throughout China.Of course, Amazon has also been busy with its new brick-and-mortar concepts. The company has recently opened bookstores in California, Oregon, and Washington, with locations in Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York coming soon. Some reports have indicated that Amazon has plans to open hundreds of bookstores throughout the country.(Also Read:Amazon to Open Brick & Mortar Bookstore in   New York City)Beyond these bookstores, Amazon is also exploring a revolutionary new retail concept known as ""Amazon Go."" The company recently soft-launched the first Amazon Go convenience store in Seattle, and it will be open to the public early this year.Amazon Go operates with a ""Just Walk Out"" shopping format that is devoid of cashiers and check outs and thus will not have long customer queues. As customers shop, a mobile app adds items to their virtual cart, generates a digital receipt, and charges customers from their Amazon account.(Also Read:Will Amazon's Convenience Stores Transform   Retail?)According to a report fromThe Wall Street Journal, Amazon has a broader plan to open over 2000 brick-and-mortar stores in three different formats depending on the success of the concepts.What Does It Mean?Both companies have not been shy about their plans for global dominance, and Alibaba commented on the success of its international expansion in its latest report. These two brands are massive e-commerce players, but their entrances into cloud computing and digital media underscore their desires to become global factors in several industries.With that said, it looks like Alibaba and Amazon's biggest impact will continue to be in the world of retail. These companies have been integral in the worldwide shift to online shopping; now they want to take over what is left of traditional retail.From our domestic perspective, it might seem like Amazon has a big head start in the battle to rule the world. Today's report tells us Alibaba is not that far behind.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI Monster;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWhen investors think of artificial intelligence stocks,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't usually the first name that comes to mind. Many consumers   viewAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) as the leader in at-home AI, due to the success of the   company's Echo device, while ""Watson"" fromInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is arguably the top turn-key artificial intelligence solution   for enterprise-level entities.Those investors who believe AI is the future, however, may want   to put MSFT stock back on their radar as a way to play the   movement.makeArticleAd();The software giant's recent acquisition of Maluuba speaks   volumes about its artificial intelligence ambitions and what it   actually wants to ""do"" with it.What's Maluuba?Maluuba isn't a household name, but within artificial   intelligence circles (and these are VP of AI Research Harry Shum's   words), ""Maluuba's vision is to advance toward a more general   artificial intelligence by creating literate machines that can   think, reason and communicate like humans - a vision exactly in   line with ours.""In simpler terms, the AI agent doesn't just serve up a   canned response to the most likely question it thinks it's being   asked based on keywords. Rather, Maluuba understands the words   being used,their context, and what information is desired. The utility of such a tool   could vary from finding a specific qualification or experience   from within a company's ranks to a chatbot that actually works   without talking in circles.Those are just small examples of how a   next-generation artificial intelligence - called artificial   general intelligence, in this case - could be used and monetized.   In September, when Microsoft assembled 5,000 engineers to work on   AI, Shum specifically pointed out that such a technology could   not only make Cortana and Skype more potent, butcould be incorporated into Microsoft's popular   cloud-based apps such as Office 365 and Azureto enhance the ease-of-use factor for those platforms.7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead       Weight Right NowYou Ain't Seen Nothin' YetIt's difficult to see, or sense, but Microsoft is developing   its AGI know-how with as much of a philosophical bent as it is a   technical one.Just in time, too. AsCIO's Matt Kapko observed in December, ""While machine learning has generated tremendous interest   throughout the enterprise, a wide gap still exists between   research and beneficial use cases in the real world.""The ramped-up focus on AI (and this happened well before   Maluuba) couldn't have come at a better time for Microsoft,   either, and by extension, for owners of MSFT stock.Calling a spade a spade, Microsoft largely missed out on the   early phase of artificial intelligence; now it's play catch up.   It's playing it well, though, particularly focusing on ""bots"" -   or chatbots that can intelligently text-chat with a user - as the   organization believes that's the interface that makes the most   sense of such a platform. This kind of AI could potentially   replace many of the touch-based apps found on your smartphone   withone voice-based conversational tool that actually   does everythingthe way you want it done.President and principal analyst of Moor Insights &   Strategy, Patrick Moorhead, has taken notice, too, commenting   last month that ""Microsoft surprised everyone in 2016 and I'm   expecting more surprises in 2017."" Specifically, Moorhead   believes Microsoft will unveil an artificial intelligence that   will not only be more powerful to individual consumers than   Amazon's Echo, but will also serve a specific business (read   ""revenue-bearing"") function. Incorporating Maluuba's know-how   will only move the company closer to that end zone.At stake is a piece of a market thatcould be worth $16.6 billion by 2022. Tractica thinks the artificial intelligence market willbe worth $36.8 billion by 2025. Both are a far cry from 2016's estimated global AI revenue of   $644 million.Now, all of a sudden, Microsoft's intense interest makes   sense.Bottom Line for MSFT StockNone of this is to suggest that that MSFT stock should be   viewed first and foremost as an artificial intelligence stock,   now or later. It's still a productivity-solutions stock, and AI   simply helps the organization provide better solutions.7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in       2017Nevertheless, Microsoft may well be working on one of the most   marketable uses of artificial intelligence, serving enterprises   in a very real way - beyond the home-utility that the Echo   provides, while not imposing overkill with something   like IBM's Watson. MSFT owners may soon find Microsoft quietly   winning the AI war with an elegant, customizable solution to real   challenges.Even if few have come to fully appreciate just how potent this   artificial intelligence product is.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in       201710 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print       Money7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI   Monsterappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Berkshire Hathaway Sold $2 Billion of Wal-Mart Stock: Time for You to Sell, Too?;1/24/2017;"Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has been unloading its position inWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) for more than a year. But in the third quarter of   2016, its selling accelerated as it dumped 70% of its remaining   stake, or about $2 billion.makeArticleAd();Though Buffett has pooh-poohed technology through his career,   the Oracle of Omaha conceded at Berkshire's shareholder meeting   last year that brick-and-mortar retailers would have trouble   keeping up withAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .At the conference, Buffett called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos a   ""genius,"" saying, ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him.   ""Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying and   he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products,   either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and   that's remarkable.""That conclusion has likely led Berkshire to shed its stake in   Wal-Mart in recent quarters as it is squarely in Amazon's path.   Berkshire may have dumped more Wal-Mart shares in the fourth   quarter of 2016.Wal-Mart at a crossroadsIt's never good when Buffett, probably the most respected   investor of all time, is selling your stock. A look at Wal-Mart's   performance also may explain why he sold, especially compared to   Amazon, which has been the best-performing stock in the last 20   years.WMTdata byYCharts.But as savvy investors know, past performance is not a   guarantee of future returns.Wal-Mart today is at a crossroads. CEO Doug McMillon has taken   several steps to revamp the company since taking the helm three   years ago. He's raised the base wage to $10 per hour, streamlined   the promotion process, and made cleaning up stores and customer   service a priority. The company has also invested billions in   e-commerce, opening hundreds of grocery pick-up kiosks, and   acquiring start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion.Brick-and-mortar retailers got hammered over the holiday   season, but Wal-Mart has not reported holiday sales. The retail   giant is also coming off eight straight quarters of comparable   sales growth, a sign it's outperforming the broader retail   industry.Because of its investments in higher wages and e-commerce, the   company is expecting profits to fall in fiscal 2017, which ends   this month, then be flat during fiscal 2018, and return to growth   in fiscal 2019. In other words, investors will need to be patient   as the company continues to invest.What's a shareholder to doWal-Mart investors should know what to expect from such a   stock. It's a defensive dividend payer that has steadily   increased its dividends for 43 years in a row, making it a   Dividend Aristocrat. Unlike a volatile stock like Amazon, which   has the potential to blockbuster returns but also put up   significant losses, Wal-Mart will be a stable slow-growth   investment. The stock is unlikely to significantly outperform the   market, especially given the challenges in retail and the   investments it's making. The nature of the company's business as   a low-cost provider means that the stock is essentially   recession-proof, and investors often flock to it when it looks   like tough times are ahead.So the decision to sell Wal-Mart should probably be determined   by your investing style. If you're a risk-averse investor looking   for modest growth and a solid dividend yield at 3%, then Wal-Mart   looks a like a good choice.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Unstoppable Despite Any Pitfalls;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips""What happened?"" It's a question often posed to celebrity crushes that are now decades past their prime. And it seems like an appropriate inquiry forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG stock is the anchor among the so-called ""FANG"" stocks, which includeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and the hot-runningNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Arguably, GOOG is the most culturally significant of the bunch, yet its recent performance has left a lot to be desired.Source: ShutterstockFor 2016, GOOG stock returned a whopping 4% even. To put that underperformance into perspective, Alphabet Inc gave shareholders 48% returns on average during the 2000s decade when it was first introduced to the markets.makeArticleAd();Inclusive of last year, its lifetime average is now a little bit above 30%. In fact, compared to the other FANGs, GOOG stock is the absolute worst. And while it's almost identical to Facebook's overall performance, both Amazon and Netflix put Alphabet Inc to shame.That's the kind of post-mortem talk you hear on CNBC when reality finally catches up to a speculative company. Certainly, it's not the kind of metric you expect from a bigger-than-life-itself organization like GOOGL. I mean, this is a company that was thecenterpieceof a Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson movie - and they totally agreed to it!But just like the movie's plot, outside appearances can be deceiving. Here are a few reasons why you should still give GOOG stock a chance.GOOG Is More Than a Search EngineFirst off, Alphabet Inc isn't just a search engine. Yes, I completely understand the argument that the vast, overwhelming majority of its multi-billion dollar business derives from advertisements. However, there are unmistakable signs of diversity.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017As InvestorPlace contributorWill Ashworth points out, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, ""GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment's overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google's other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier."" Essentially, Alphabet Inc can spin off a brand new business separate from advertisements, and it would do just fine.Indeed, GOOG stock is backed by coverage of over157 products, according to another InvestorPlace colleague, Aaron Levitt. While a good chunk of the offerings are web-based applications, such as Gmail, Maps and Chrome, ""the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market."" As we move forward, GOOG stock may be less recognized as an app investment, and more as a consumer electronics investment similar toApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) orSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE).As both Ashworth and Levitt note, diversification towards physical devices and non-core businesses don't necessarily endear folks to GOOG stock. Many of these divisions are money losers. The Motorola venture was a particularly rotten deal.However, I wholeheartedly agree with Ashworth's thesis: ""As painful as it is for investors to see Alphabet pour good money after bad into its Other Bets, GOOGL stock depends on it. Because its legacy business likely won't be this profitable 10 years from now.""Alphabet Inc Has the Ultimate Trump CardPerhaps most analysts bullish towards GOOG stock have laid out similar arguments - Alphabet Inc is more than just a one trick pony. Considering all the evidence, it would be foolish to attempt to counter it. But allow me to shamelessly grab the ultra-low hanging fruit. Just what the heck is wrong with being a one trick pony?3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep     Delivering in 2017We're not talking aboutPolaroidhere.Click to EnlargeBy investing in GOOG stock, you are taking ownership in not only a massive company, but a cultural phenomenon.Consider that among the mostpopular search engineson the internet, Google beats out second-best competitor Bing by a margin of 300%! Startlingly, the gap between first and fifth place is nearly 1,200%. Against the bottom run of the top ten, the gap is nearly 12,000%.In other words, if you think that Google will ever be upended by anyone else, think again. No other investment besides GOOG stock has such dominance over their industries that people refer to it by the company name. WeGooglethings on the web. And until the day I hear ""I'lliPhoneyou,"" people can rest assured in their GOOG position.Put in the simplest of terms, unless there are Russian ICBMs raining down on us, I would never short GOOG stock. The only caveat would be to point out instances of potential technical weakness. Even then, the volatility would likely be on a short-term basis. As I stated above, Alphabet Inc has too much of a powerful brand to ever fail.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.More From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     Back10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     MoneyThe postWhy Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Unstoppable Despite Any Pitfallsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Stock Faceoff: Wal-Mart Stores Inc vs Target Corporation (WMT, TGT);1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the back of astrong holiday season, retailers are back in the spotlight.makeArticleAd();To start out the new year, we want to take the time to circle back to two of our previous long ideas on some of the giants in the retail industry:Wal-MartStores Inc(WMT) andTargetCorporation(TGT).We recommended both of these companies to investors in 2015. So far, both picks have underperformed. WMT is up 1% since our call, vs. 14% for theS&P 500. TGT has dropped by 11% while the S&P is up 6%.Both stocks still look sound, while earning our Attractive rating.Since these are two of the largest retailers in America, and direct competitors, it seems fair to ask: which is the better stock for investors in 2017?In this article, we will judge Wal-Mart and Target on five key categories:ProfitabilityValuationCash Flow YieldCorporate GovernanceGrowth OpportunitiesTwo stocks enter. One stock leaves. Who will emerge the champion in this faceoff of retail giants?Wal-Mart vs Target  - ProfitabilityFrom 1998 to 2015, Wal-Mart dominated this category. The company earned a superior return on invested capital (ROIC) in every single year over that time frame. Per Figure 1, however, that dominance evaporated last year.Figure 1: Wal-Mart Vs. Target ROIC: 1998-CurrentSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Target's ROIC has surged in the past few years as it hassold off unprofitable business linesand refocused on its core competencies. Wal-Mart's ROIC has gone in the opposite direction as it hasoverpaid for acquisitionsand seen its already thin margins further squeezed byrising labor costs.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThough Wal-Mart's profitability dominated Target for most of the last twenty years, we've seen Target make some big improvements while Wal-Mart has faltered. Right now, Target is the more profitable company, and we expect that edge to last.Scoreboard: Target 1, Wal-Mart 0WMT and TGT Stock ValuationsBoth of these stocks are cheap. A variety of factors, from low growth potential, to theevergreen fears overAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN), have weighed on their stock prices.WMT was up 13% in 2016, while TGT was flat, but both stocks are still quite cheap based on their current profits. Both stocks have a price to economic book value ratio (PEBV) of just 0.6. This ratio means the market expects a permanent 40% decline in after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) for both companies.While it's certainly fair to be wary of the risks facing traditional retailers, such a pessimistic outlook seems unwarranted. Both Wal-Mart and Target are appealingly cheap, which makes this round a push.Scoreboard: Target 1.5, Wal-Mart 0.5Let's continue to evaluate these two giants…Cash Flow YieldsCash is king. This fact goes double for companies like Wal-Mart and Target that require heavy capital investment and return a large amount of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Both Target and Wal-Mart generate substantialfree cash flow. Per Figure 2, that cash flow comes in different ways. Wal-Mart provides a steady stream of cash year after year, whereas Target has oscillated between years of great free cash flow and years of low or even negative cash flow.Figure 2: Wal-Mart Vs. Target Free Cash Flow Yield: 1999-CurrentSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.While Wal-Mart may have the more consistent stream of cash flow, Target has had a better free cash flow yield in four out of the past six years, and a superior average yield in that timeframe, so Target wins this round.Scoreboard: Target 2.5, Wal-Mart 0.5Growth OpportunitiesNeither of these companies offers investors significant growth potential from their impressive brick-and-mortar footprints. Target's sales have been flat to down recently, and it'sfocusing on small storesthat offer only incremental growth going forward. Wal-Mart has announced that it'sslowing the paceof its new store openings over the next couple years.Online sales have been rosier. Target announced online salesgrew by 26%in the most recent quarter. Wal-Mart acquired therapidly growing Jet.comin a deal that, while richly valued, should provide a significant boost to its e-commerce efforts.Consensus analyst forecasts have Wal-Mart's revenue growing by 1.3% compounded annually over the next two years. That's not a number to generate much excitement, but it's better than their projection for a 1.9% compounded annual decline in Target's sales. Wal-Mart wins this round.Scoreboard: Target 2.5, Wal-Mart 1.5Corporate GovernanceCorporate governance, especially executive compensation, is a critical and underappreciated aspect of investment analysis. High quality executive compensation plans hold executives accountable for capital allocation and align their interests with shareholders. Low quality compensation plans can encourage executives to engage in activities thatdestroy shareholder value.Both Wal-Mart and Target start off great by tying a significant portion of executive's long-term stock grants to ROIC. Even better, they both make an effort to calculate an accurate ROIC and account foroff-balance sheet debtdue to operating leases.Digging deeper though, Target's ROIC methodology is more rigorous. It not only capitalizes operating leases, it also adds back theimplied interest componentof those leases. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart uses pretax operating income rather than NOPAT, which along with some other unorthodox practices makes its ROIC number less reliable.We applaud those firms that make the effort to hold executives accountable to performance metrics that are directly aligned with shareholder value creation. Though ROIC is a simple concept, it is a rathermajor undertaking to get right, especially across multiple companies. Target's efforts here are noteworthy.Wal-Mart does better than most companies we cover at aligning executive incentives with shareholder value, but Target's executive compensation plan is one of the gold standards in corporate America. Target wins this round and the matchScoreboard: Target 3.5, Wal-Mart 1.5Our Conclusion: If You Must Choose One…You can't go wrong with either of these stocks. They both have great track records of profitability and cheap valuations. If you have to choose just one, though, Target's superior ROIC, cash flow, and executive compensation practices make it the better pick in 2017 for investors.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017This article originally publishedhereon January 3, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, style, or theme.Article by Sam McBride,New ConstructsThe postWal-Mart vs Target - Stock Faceoff: Giants Of Retailappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Obama Knows What's Really Killing Jobs. Is Trump Listening?;1/24/2017;"President Donald Trump has made jobs, and bringing them back   to the United States, a key part of his platform. That was a   major theme during his campaign and his first acts in office have   included opting out of trade deals, saluting companies that have   made hiring announcements, and promising hefty tariffs for those   sending work outside the country.It's a message that has played well to his base. That makes   sense because a laid-off auto worker or former factory worker   wants to hear that things can go back to where they were.The problem, and it's one that Barack Obama laid out in his   final interview as president, is that American jobs moving   overseas is not the long-term issue. Instead, America's former   commander in chief said, the issue is robots and automation. And,   Obama pointed out, it's not just factories. It's also retail jobs   being lost due to sales moving online to retailers led byAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , which employs about 200,000 people, but well   less than the combined total of the retailers it's   displacing.makeArticleAd();Amazon uses a mix of humans and robots in its warehouse. Image   source: Amazon.Where are all the jobs going?Appearing on thePod Save Americanpodcast hosted by a group of his former aides, Obama told Jon   Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer, and Tommy Vietor, that the   robots are coming. It wasn't presented as a rebuff to Trump, just   as a statement of truth, delivered by a man who no longer has to   run for office.""The fact is and the data shows this, the jobs that are going   away are going away primarily due to automation,"" he said.   ""Automation is relentless and it's going to accelerate.""In the Jan. 19 podcast, Obama cited examples including the   potential for driverless Uber vehicles along with office workers   being displaced when their work becomes automated. He laid out   that this is not just an issue involving factory jobs, but   multiple segments of the employment market.""You saw what happened to retail stores sales this past   Christmas. Amazon and online sales is killing traditional retail,   and what's true there is going to be true throughout our   economy,"" he said. ""We are going to have to start thinking about   where do jobs come from and how much government involvement we   want in the marketplace.""Facts back up ObamaWhat Obama said is supported by numbers from Rice University's   Moshe Vardi. The professor of computational engineering has   written about how manufacturing employment has been falling for   more than 30 years, while U.S. manufacturing output is near   its all-time high.""Job losses due to automation and robotics are often   overlooked in discussions about the unexpected rise of outside   political candidates like Trump and Bernie Sanders,"" said Vardi   in a July 2016press release. ""U.S. factories are not disappearing; they simply aren't   employing human workers.""What we want to hear vs. what we need to hearA president with just hours left in office has a luxury that   current politicians do not. He doesn't t have another election to   win so he can stop peddling easy answers.Obama acknowledged that tougher negotiations with Mexico or   China might bring some jobs back for the short term, but that's   clearly not the underlying problem. What the current   administration needs to deal with is that automation and robots   have changed the nature of work. That change might be delayed in   some cases because foreign workers are cheaper than automating,   but that's really just a question of time.The current administration has a choice when it comes to jobs.   It can focus on short-term victories that won't change the ending   or it can look at the more complicated question of how to evolve   a workforce for the jobs that will exist tomorrow not the ones   from today and yesterday.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.
