Is Management Really to Blame for Intel Corporation's Woes?,3/20/2017,"Brian Krzanich becameIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) sixth CEO on May 16, 2013. Sinc then, Intel stock ha ralli 46% -- which seem solid, but mere match the S&P 500' 46% gain and underperform the NASDAQ' 72% gain. That perform isn't bad, but mani investor have wonder if Intel would fare better under a new leader.Last May, fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa argu that it wastim to replaceKrzanich, due to Intel' disastr mobil strategy, it delay transit from 14nm to 10nm chips, and the stock' lacklust performance. But is Krzanich the real reason that Intel fail to outperform the market? Let' take a closer look at the biggest problem with Krzanich' leadership, and whether or not those flaw are drag down Intel' growth.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Intel drop the mobil ball befor Krzanich took overTo be fair, Krzanich wa dealt a terribl hand in the mobil market when he becam Intel' CEO. In 2006, hi predecessor Paul Otellini sold Intel' ARM-bas Xscale busi toMarvel Technology, then rejectedApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) offer to suppli applic processor for the first iPhone. At the time, Otellini didn't believ that mobil chip would disrupt the PC market.In 2008, Intel launch it low-pow Atom x86 chip for netbook and mobil devices, but the first gener chip were less power effici than ARM designs. The Atom chip gradual improv over time, but that initi misstep enabl ARM chipmak likeQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) to take over the mobil market. ARM claim that 95% of all smartphon in the world now use it chip designs.But Krzanich' solut were also ineffectiveTh good news is that Krzanich realiz that Intel had to counter ARM in the mobil market. The bad news is that hi solut were expens and ineffective.Krzanich tri to win back mobil OEM by give them steep discount on Atom chips, co-market agreements, and financi aid in redesign logic board for x86 chips. The compani call those subsidi ""contra revenues"", which burn through roughli $10 billion to captur less than 1% of the mobil market.Intel' Atom-pow smartphones. Imag source: Intel.Krzanich then hire sever major execut fromQualcomm and ARM, which wa a bold move for the insular company. But those hires, particularli that of former Qualcomm co-presid Venkata ""Murthy"" Renduchintala, reportedli stir up intern conflicts. Krzanich final admit defeat and Intel stop invest in it Atom chipset for smartphon and tablet last year,opt to pivottoward modem for the latest iPhon and next-gen 5G chipset instead.Pul some iPhon modem order from Qualcomm should have been a victori for Intel, but Appl admit that itthrottl the speedof Qualcomm modem in the iPhon 7 to match the slower speed of the Intel modems. That report cast seriou doubt on Intel' abil to effect grow it baseband modem business.Krzanich believ that expand Intel' presenc in the Internet of Thing (IoT) market with low-pow modul like the button-s Curi will offset it weak in mobil devices. However, the IoT busi account for just 4% of it revenu in 2016, and the busi face stiff competit from low-pow ARM modules.Intel could lose it domin of PC and data centersLook ahead, Intel' domin market share in PC and data center could be threaten by new product and partnerships.AMD(NASDAQ: AMD) , for example, recent introduc it new Ryzen x86 chips, which appear to trump Intel' current-gen Kabi Lake chip in term of price-to-performance.Imag source: Intel.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent launch new version of Window 10 which are compat with both Intel' x86 chip and Qualcomm' Snapdragon chips. Microsoft also announc that it will run it Azur cloud platform on Qualcomm' new ARM-bas Centriq 2400 server solutions. These new deal could eventu throttl the growth of Intel' core Client Comput and Data Center businesses.Krzanich' pricey turnaround strategiesLastly, Krzanich' turnaround strategi are expensive. Besid the $10 billion in contra revenu it burn through in three years, Intel spent nearli $17 billion on programm chipmak Altera in late 2015, and recent announc that it would acquir automot collis avoid system makerMobileyefor over $15 billion. These move are caus Intel' long-term debt to surg rel to it free cash flow.Source:YChartsThos acquisit won't endang Intel' dividends, which use up just 35% of it FCF over the past 12 months, but they indic that Krzanich could ""diworsify"" the company' busi with desper pricey acquisitions.Th verdictIt' tempt to think that Intel might fare better under a new leader, but Krzanich inherit a troubl compani and I believ he' tri to rejuven the compani with outsid hires, expans into new market like non-volatil memori and IoT chips, and strateg acquisitions.Thes effort won't pay off anytim soon, sinc analyst expect Intel' revenu and earn to respect rise just 1% and 3% thi year, but they could eventu reduc the company' depend on it age PC and data center businesses.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Companies Set to Make a Killing From Driverless Cars,3/17/2017,"Driverless car technolog is still in it nascent stage but will grow in leap and bound in the come years. IH Automot forecast that autonom vehicl sale will shoot up from 600,000 unit in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clock a compound annual growth rate of 43%.The Boston Consult Group, meanwhile, expect the driverless car market to creat a $42 billion revenu opportun in 2025 itself, indic that there is a lot of money to be made in thi space. One of the way to tap thi huge opportun is through technolog provid such asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-crit role in enabl autonom cars.NVIDIA' GPU are boost self-driv technologyNVIDIA is best known for make game graphic cards, but it product are in high demand from automak as well.Tesla, for instance, is use the chipmaker' artifici intelligence-bas DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X cars. What' more, the automak is also go to deploy NVIDIA' supercomput in it mass-market Model 3.makeArticleAd();Th Tesla partnership is alreadi deliv results, as NVIDIA' automot revenu shot up over 37% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter. The compani could sustain it automot momentum, as it is work with German giant Audi to bring a Level 4 autonom car to the market by 2020. Level 4 mean it can drive itself entir on it own.Th two compani showcas an Audi Q7 at CE earlier thi year, claim that the car learn to drive on it own in just four day use NVIDIA' AI-bas DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More importantly, NVIDIA is look to push the envelope: It' now work on a more advanc supercomput platform -- Xavier -- that consum less power but pack more comput capacity.NVIDIA' graphic process unit acceler the process of huge amount of data in real time, allow the vehicl to make quick decisions. As the compani increasingli turn it attent toward make it self-driv supercomput better through partnership with big auto companies, it won't be surpris if it platform end up power fulli autonom car by 2020.NVIDIA, therefore, look right on the edg of tap the driverless car opportunity, as 80 compani are use the DRIVE PX2 platform to develop their technology.Microsoft' big data opportunityDriverless cars, or ani connect car for that matter, will gener huge volum of data from their sensor and camera that will need storag and processing. Microsoftw to ingestal thi data and then use it artifici intellig (AI) skill to analyz it to help car drive better through it Azur cloud-bas Connect Vehicl Platform.Imag source: Microsoft.Th Redmond-bas compani ha pick a sweet spot to tap the driverless car opportunity, as a connect vehicl is slate to produc 20 gigabyt of data per day in 2017 if driven for just two hours. In the case of autonom cars, the data gener could be at least 10 gigabyt per second. Now, all thi data can't be store on the car itself due to limit storag capacity, creat an opportun for Microsoft to push it cloud product to automakers.TheRenault-Nissanalli ha alreadi decid to use the softwar giant' connect vehicl platform, pledg to put 10 car with autonom technolog on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian automakerTata Motorsi adopt the platform to bring connect featur and predict mainten at afford price to mass-market vehicl in India.Microsoft is also find demand for it connect car platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsur provid Swiss Re will analyz drive behavior with the help of the telemat data collect by the cloud, and then creat custom insur deal for customers.Th inevit data increas from driverless and connect car could power Microsoft' Azur cloud busi to new high in the long run, allow it to sustain rapid revenu growth from thi segment.Imag source: Waymo.Alphabet' Waymo moonshot could be a big businessAlphabet' Waymo divis ha thebest driverless cartechnology, accord to data from the California DMV. As it turn out, it driverless car have the lowest incid rate and the highest mile log compar to the other test their technolog on California roads.Alphabet can use it lead in thi space by becom an infrastructur and knowledg supplier to auto companies, and thi is what it is probabl plan to do. Earlier thi year, Waymo announc that it is go to manufactur driverless-technology-en sensor on it own so that it can better integr the softwar into hardware.In fact, the Waymo divis ha slash the price of the crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% sinc 2009, so it make sens for it to offer a packag hardware-softwar bundl to potenti customers. The compani ha alreadi gain a custom in the form ofFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor it self-driv technology, with Bloombergreportingthat both compani could eventu roll out a ride-shar service.On the other hand,Hondaseem to be warm up to Waymo' self-driv capabl to acceler it own driverless car development. The Japanes automak is now explor the possibl of equip it car with fulli autonom drive technolog in citi instead of it earlier ambit of just highway driving.Therefore, Alphabet' year of leadership in driverless car make it one of the hottest prospect to benefit from thi emerg technology.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That $0.06 beat translat into an 8.3% posit earn surpris and it is the fourth straight beat of the Zack Consensu Estimate.GrowthI am a growth guy and just base on the size of the compani like ADB and ORCL I would avoid them. My think wa that the best day were behind these name and growth would be veri hard to come by. I am adjust my think on the big cap tech names.Let' look at the ADB and specif the topline. As a growth guy, I am much more interest in what is go up top than on the bottom line. Don't get me wrong, earn are super important, but to me, I need to see what is caus the growth and why.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1ADB Top LineTh toplin number of $1.68B wa better than the consensu estim of $1.64B.

Read on to find out.Sport Deal Are Roll InSoci network are a big boon for sport leagu and right holder becaus of dwindl viewership on tradit platform like TV, especi among younger audiences. Social network also facilit better interact with the event by combin viewership, commentari and reaction to a game, make it a more enjoy experience.They also help content provid reach their audienc directly, result in innov that can further person the experience. That' the reason they have been tri out event on both Facebook and Twitter.Ov the past month, Facebook sign on Major Leagu Basebal (MLB) for a game a week and Univis Commun for 46 Liga MX game (live game from Mexico' top soccer league). The Liga MX game are target at U.S. audienc onli with Tonia O'Connor, Univision' chief commerci offic and presid of content distribut expect it to better connect with and grow it English speak audience.Video Is the FutureFacebook ha launch a new TV app for AmazonAMZNFir TV, AppleAAPLTV and Samsung Smart TV, with possibl plan to further expand to other platform like MicrosoftMSFTXbox, SonySNEPlaySt and other stream devices. While thi will like enable/support longer video formats, Facebook ha said it intent is not to compet with Netflix but rather to enabl Facebook user to watch their prefer video on just about ani screen of their choic (and that includ TV screens).Of cours that' not the onli video announc Facebook made. The compani say that henceforth, video will play automat with the sound turn on by default (if the devic sound is turn on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watch the video while scroll through your newsfeed. Facebook say that test show posit reaction from user although it' obviou that not everyon will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedli in talk with music label to bring their content to the app, which seem like an open challeng to YouTube, Google' compet site. For labels, the new distribut channel will increas their leverag against YouTub for more favor terms. On the flip side, the chanc of piraci will increas given the natur of Facebook' free platform.Th increas scope for advertis is also an indic that the compani is gear up to grab it share of TV ad dollars.Tim for a VR Realiti CheckLast year saw a lot of hype relat to virtual realiti (VR), which wa bill as the next major platform for consumer-typ experi after the mobil revolution. SuperData Research reportedli had veri ambiti growth target of $5.1 billion in 2016 (from $600 million in 2015) to $8.9 billion by 2017 and $12.3 billion by 2018. The longer term estim are even more optimistic: Citigroup reportedli say that the AR/VR market will gener $2.16 trillion by 2035.Near term, however, thing don't look so good, with the market do just $1.8 billion in 2016. The primari drawback to adopt seem to be compel content and softwar tailor for the VR experi and still-high price for a technolog that is still in it veri earli days.Suffici softwar won't be avail until there are big enough platforms, whether base on Occulu or Google' Daydream, which is whi the two compani are push away regardless.Devic price vari huge rang from the (HTC Vive at $799, PlayStat VR at $399 and Occulus' own Rift somewher in between at $599 without the $199 for the Touch motion controllers). Other like Microsoft, Appl and even Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl have invest in augment realiti (AR).Facebook chose the high end becaus it ha alway held that for VR to succeed, the feel must be good, not the quick-heating, nauseat experi enabl through smartphones. And becaus it want to ultim enabl social network use the technology. At ani rate, the compani ha now decid to scale back the number of Best Buy store-within-stor from 500 to 300. It' also decid to lower the price of Rift+Touch to $598. The strategi make sense: bring more peopl on the platform to financ it further development.Activist Don't Want Zuckerberg as Board ChairpersonA group of activist shareholders, part of a consum watchdog group call SumOfU have propos that an independ chairperson would better ""overse the execut of the company, improv corpor governance, and set a more accountable, pro-sharehold agenda.""

While LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft) ha been around for a while, the site is more popular with higher-incom groups. Facebook on the other hand ha peopl from everi walk of life and employ of everi kind on it network, so it' in a veri good posit to corner a much larger section of the market than LinkedIn ever reached.A Fake News Solution?Facebook ha said that it will tag news stori that an independ group of peopl say are fake with a ""disputed"" tag. It won't remov the stori however. Facebook ha been on pull up by the media sinc Trump won the elect and some peopl went as far as to say that the win wa facilit by move sentiment with the help of fake news stories.Oth NewsNew Account Chief: LinkedIn VP, controller, and chief account offic Susan Taylor will join Facebook as it chief account offic next month for an annual base salari of $400,000, annual bonus, a one-time, non-recur sign-on bonu of $400,000 and restrict stock unit with an initi valu of about $3.5 million.New VR Chief: Facebook ha made an import hire in Hugo Barra, who ha spent the last three year rev up the market machineri at Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphon are attribut to him) and serv as Google' Android chief befor that.

Thi will help monet the platform and if successful, lead to a broader rollout across the world.Su for Occulu Tech: A juri ha decid that ZeniMax will receiv $500 million from Oculu owner Facebook as it wa guilti of copyright infringement, the failur to compli with a non-disclosur agreement, and for the misus of Oculu trademarks. The amount to be paid is split up as follows- $200 million for violat a non-disclosur agreement, $50 million for copyright infring and $50 million for improp use of ZeniMax trademarks.

Thi should pacifi advertis becaus the accredit servic is also use by mani of them (and publishers) thu ad to it credibility.New Video Ad Format: Facebook ha said that it is go to start show ad insid videos, not the pre-rol ad that YouTub use but mid-roll, when you'r around 20 second into the video. There can also be more than one commerci break in the video, but these will be at least two minut apart.Chatbot Scale Back: Facebook want Messeng to be the go-to place for brand to interact with their customers. So the compani launch chatbot develop tool roughli a year ago. While it initi announc that nearli 11K chatbot had been developed, there hasn't been much news recent about new apps. Now, the Inform report that mani of the chatbot weren't abl to answer 70% of custom queries, lead Facebook to shelv the idea for now.Messeng Enhancements: But The Inform also ha good thing to say about Messenger.

3 IBM Moonshots Shareholders Should Know About,3/16/2017,"Who knew that a compani as big and well-known asIBM(NYSE: IBM) could becom a battleground stock? In the span of a day, two sell-sid analyst gave two starkli differ take on the company. Jefferi analyst Jame Kisner reiter hi underperform rate on the company, with a price target of $125, while Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White rais hi target to an outperform and a whop $215. The stock current trade near the midpoint of the two, at $180 per share and 14.5 time earnings. Thi seem to be par for the cours for IBM, with invest great such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmil take similarli diverg stances, with Buffett long and Druckenmil short.Th diverg seem to be on the topic of IBM' ""moonshot"" bets. Most know the compani ha had declin revenu for roughli 19 straight quarters, though some of the declin came from the the compani divest unprofit busi units, such as semiconductor manufacturing. In addition, even it exist cash cow are declin as well, as the compani wa late to the cloud-comput game, now domin byAmazon.comandMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) . Thi is the crux of the bears' case.IBM is not stand still, however; it ha been aggress invest in new technolog and buy compani in ""bolt-on"" acquisit around these new bets. One need to look no further than the recent number from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which show that IBM wa grant the most patent in the U.S. in 2016...for the 24th year in a row. It' clear that pioneer new technolog is part of the company' DNA, and bull have faith that some, or mayb all, of these new bet could lead to big payoff in the future. Three big bet to watch out for are Watson, blockchain, and quantum computing.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.WatsonOn could say that Watson is the most matur of the big bets, though it is difficult to get a grasp on how much revenu the segment generates. The unit is group within the ""strateg imperatives"" unit of the company, which exceed $32 billion and made up more than 40% of the company' revenu in 2016. Such a contribut to revenu wa ahead of schedule, accord to CEO Ginni Rometty.Mani first got to know Watson in 2011, when it beat a coupl of us ""humans"" onJeopardy!in 2011, show America that artifici intellig wa not just the stuff of Stanley Kubrick movi anymore.Sinc then, IBM ha develop Watson by purchas compani such as Truven Health Analyt for healthcare, Promontori Financi Group for financi servic regulation, and The Weather Compani for (you guess it) weather, specif for applic for the Internet of Things. With these acquisitions, the compani claims, it is obtain valuabl industri data that is not public, plu the best practic and expertis that come from the employe of these companies.IBM ha a plan to differenti Watson from all of the other AI platform out there. Rometti explain that 80% of all data is non-publ , which mean that those who own the data -- the compani that collect it -- valu it highly. IBM is promis these compani that in exchang for feed their data into Watson, IBM will let them keep their insight private.Accord to Rometti at Monday'sinvestor presentation, Watson will touch a billion peopl by the end of thi year. She also threw out a $2 trillion number -- that' with a ""t"" -- as the market for enhanc decision-mak via machin learning. There have certainli been a lot of Watson-rel headlin these days, with new partnership withH&R Block(NYSE: HRB) , which is use financial-industri data for it clients;salesforce.com(NYSE: CRM) , which note that it partnership wa to make partial use of Watson' weather-rel insight for insur clients; and the Health Transform Alliance, a nonprofit allianc of twenti larg American employers, which will use Watson to help bring down the consortium' healthcar costs.BlockchainWhil mani had Bitcoin fever a few year ago when the digit currenc made wave on the internet, IBM saw potenti in it underli technology, call the blockchain.A featur in arecentNew York Timesarticle, IBM is work withWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) , Danish companyMaersk(NASDAQOTH: AMKBF) , and almost four hundr other compani in test out thi implement of the technology.Blockchain use high-pow comput and advanc math to note transact between two parties, and doe so in a way that make alter of the record after the fact impossible. As one can imagine, IBM is look to implement thi for financi institut in record trades. But compani that ship product around the world like Wal-Mart and Maersk can benefit, too. Accord to the article, when these compani ship containers, each contain may requir up to thirti approv from variou inspector and custom officials. The system is also prone to fraud. A success implement of blockchain technolog could help with that, lead to larg save for these ship companies.On thing to watch out for, say the article, is that some larg compani are reluct to make IBM Blockchain the de facto standard, as it might lock them into IBM' ecosystem.JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) , for instance, is work with Microsoft on it own blockchain technolog call Ethereum.Quantum computingPerhap the most far-out moonshot -- in term of both time and cool -- is IBM' foray into quantum computing. Quantum comput can process inform that regular comput can't. Wherea the most power comput today can come up with solut base on current avail data (a feat in itself), quantum comput can theoret solv problem for which there are no pattern in the data, and the possibl to explor are too numer for even the fastest ""regular computers.""Whoa.How is thi possible? Accord tofuturism.com:Thi increas in speed is made possibl through the use of quantum bit (or qubits) instead of the binari bit that current comput employ. Qubit reli on the quantum phenomenon of superposition, which allow them to be 0s or 1s at the same time. Thi abil to exist in multipl state at onc enabl qubit to process inform more quickly.Everybodi got that? Me neither. In fact, even IBM doesn't have all the answers. That is whi it is open up a project calledIBM Q, which will enlist anyon interest in the field to contribut code and research, as open source.Th compani open up a 5-qubit system in May, but one day hope to build the world' first quantum comput with 50 qubits, which will help solv problem in medicine, materi science, and finance.

Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA,3/16/2017,"Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) are titan of the same semiconductor industry, born a gener apart. As in all human endeavors, the onli constant in busi is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find themselv today at differ stage of their corpor life cycles.Thank to come adopt of technolog such as self-driv car and artificial-intellig (AI) software, NVIDIA ha seen demand for it graphic chip move from a nich into the mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roar to global domin dure the rise of PC and mainfram servers, but it ha struggl to tap into more recent growth market such as mobil computing, deep learning, and the like.So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or NVIDIA? Let' examin three differ aspect for NVIDIA and Intel to determin which companies' share appear more attract today.makeArticleAd();Financi fortitudeThos same life-cycl differ reveal themselv in assess the financi strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at these four import metric of liquid and solvenc for both companies.CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioNVIDIA$6.8 billion$2.8 billion$1.7 billion4.7Intel$14.9 billion$25.2 billion$21.8 billion1.7Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo! Finance.NVIDIA easili beat Intel in term of near-term liquid -- as evidenc by it current ratio -- and in term of net debt, which is just a fanci account term for cash and equival minu debt. That be said, Intel' cash flow-gener capabl are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of it debt will matur in 2022 or later, Intel could easili eras the major of it leverag in a singl year, even after subtract the $9.6 billion it spent on capit expenditur in 2016.Intel is also an exampl of a compani that use debt, or a leverag capit structure, as a sourc of competit advantage. It' one of the few semiconductor compani that also own it chip fabric plants; NVIDIA outsourc it fab to a consortium of partner includingTaiwan Semiconductor,Samsung, and more. Oper larg fix asset such as semiconductor manufactur plant requir plenti of capital, which explain Intel' use of ampl leverage. Either way, both compani are in fine financi shape, given their respect strategies, so let' call thi one a tie and move on.Winner: Tie.Imag source: Getti Images.Dur competit advantagesNVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaning competit advantag in their respect area of the global semiconductor market.Sourc estim Intel control 87% of the PC CPU market and 95% the server CPU market, although the exact number aren't as import as know that Intel domin the global PC and data center microprocessor markets, and for a predict reason: Intel' longtim perform advantag over the competit -- namely,Advanc Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) -- ha allow the compani to charg higher price per unit for it chips.Intel plow an aggress portion of it profit back into it research and development, which has, in turn, allow it to maintain the perform advantag of it chips. Bar execut risks, which have been a concern fromtim to time, thi long-stand trend ha serv as a virtuou cycl that ha allow Intel to domin it core market and consist produc above-averag profit for it shareholders.Th dollar valu involv help flesh thi dynam out a bit more. In the past three years, AMD' revenu ha total $4.2 billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in 2014. In contrast, Intel' research-and-develop budgetaloneha total $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over the same period. Thi kind of structur advantag is incred difficult to overcome.NVIDIA' competit advantag are more technolog than structur at the moment. Becaus of it long-stand place as the creator graphic computing, on which it still focuses, NVIDIA' chip have gener been the best of breed in each of the graphic process applic it product serve. The compani press that advantag with last year' debut of it Pascal architecture, around which it launch a number of new chips.Bett still, NVIDIA ha use it advantag to help consolid earli lead in core growth market such as AI comput platform and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA ha becom the GPU supplier to the AI effort atMicrosoft,Facebook,Amazon.com,Alphabet, andApple,to name a few. Much ha also been made of NVIDIA' potenti in self-driv cars, where it suppli the graphic chip that power the autonomous-vehicl effort ofFord,Tesla,Volkswagen,Honda, and mani more. Both of these industri figur to offer substanti growth opportun over the come decade, and NVIDIA' place as the go-to supplier to support these emerg technolog speak to their compel valu proposition.Winner: NVIDIA.ValuationTh way the market is price Intel and NVIDIA share should come as littl surprise, given what we just learn about the outlook for their businesses. Here' a snapshot of three of the most commonli use valuat metric for Intel and NVIDIA.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDANVIDIA38.329.523.6Intel16.912.37.8Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Both compani also pay dividends: Intel share current yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%.A for which stock appear the more attract valued, I think both compani appear reason valued, given their respect growth outlooks. The multipl trend fuel NVIDIA' growth should support it earn growth for arguabl a decad or more, so it sky-high valuat shouldn't be a deterr for investor with a similarli long time horizon.A more of a matur company, Intel will have it invest outlook driven by it abil to grow it EP and return excess capit to shareholders. It fantast econom should allow it to do so, but it' hard to get excit about a compani that analyst see grow sale just 0.9% thi year and 2% in 2018. So in term of which compani is more appropri valued, I think both compani trade near price that seem fair.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... NVIDIA by a noseBoth compani present interest valu proposit to investor today. Intel offer a mix of profit and incom at a fairli discount price, which could prove compel to more conserv investors. However, mani of NVIDIA' growth market are in their earli stages, which make it the more attract stock to own over the long term.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nearli 22% revenu growth wa two point ahead of consensus.ADB stock is up roughli 4% in after-hour trading, after yet anoth quarter that seem to support the long-term bull case for Adob stock.Adob Earnings: The Fifth Straight BeatAdobe' fiscal first-quart earn were even more impress than past beats. On average, Adob earn had come in about 4% abov consensu the past few quarters; in Q1 FY17, Adob beat by a solid 8%.7 Dividend Stock With Yield That Grow Like WeedsBeyond the numbers, the news wa good - and broad-based. Digit Media Annual Recur Revenu (ARR), a key measur of the company' success in ""cloud,"" hit $4.25 billion, up nearli 7% simpli in the first three months. Market Cloud revenu of $477 million wa up over 26% year-over-year, actual acceler from prior-year growth of 21%.

That figur is move to a larger and larger share of overal revenue: now about 70% on a trail twelve-month basis. The abil to continu torrid growth even on a base that size - and without simpli take revenu away from legaci product sales, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) doe with Offic - seem like to support Adob stock in trade on Friday.Th second area of focu is in the Market Cloud business.

Adob is go up against giant such assalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM),Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM).Clearly, Adob is winning. The nearli 27% revenu growth in that busi seem like to be a major facet of the narr come out of Adob earnings. The market busi is the one segment where Adob ha true upside: in most of the Creativ Media business, for instance, the company' domin is such that eventu it growth rate will slow to that of the market as a whole.Marketing, however, present a multi-billion-dollar opportun with liter worldwid potential. And the fact that Adob is not onli surviving, but thrive while fight some of the largest tech compani in the world ha to boost the case for Adob stock.Bottom Line on ADB StockAl told, the Adob earn surpris should be no surprise. Thi is a compani fire on all cylinders, with substanti market opportun in front of it. I'd be surpris to see the market shrug off the Q1 beat as someth alreadi incorpor into Adobe' stock price.

"Is Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Stuck In a Bear Trap?",3/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) is realli a victim of it own amaz success. Sinc the mid-1980s, the compani ha been abl to develop cutting-edg mobil technolog that have defin the industry. The result is that the profit have been standout. Yet thi ha caught the ire of custom and even governments. The claim: QCOM is realli a monopolist that is will to leverag it unfair power.makeArticleAd();Source:Karli Dambran via FlickrThi ha happen to other tech titan through history, of course.Just some of the exampl includeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM). The problem is that - even when they resolv their legal disput and antitrust action - the compani suffer a prolong period of stagnat and sub-par investor returns.Unfortunately, I think the same could be the case with Qualcomm stock. Alreadi the return have been lackluster. For the last five years, QCOM stock ha post a miser 11% loss.QCOM Stock' WoesThen again, the compani must deal with a host of massiv legal actions. While one wa settled, which includ a $975 million payment to the Chines antitrust authorities, there are current activ suit in the U.S., Europ and Korea, which recent file a claim for $873 million. Then of course, there is the $1 billion suit fromAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).And yes, the core legal claim is that the practic of QCOM are inher anti-competit and unfair. After all, when the compani charg a royalty, it is not a fix amount per unit, but instead a percentag of the price of the device.7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackAccord toAAPL CEO Tim Cook:""They were insist on charg royalti for technolog that they had noth to do with. And so we were in a situat where the more we innov with uniqu featur like touch ID or advanc display or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expens it would be for us to innovate. So, it' somewhat like buy a sofa and you charg somebodi a differ price depend upon the price of the hous that it goe into, just from our point of view, thi doesn't make sens and we don't believ it will pass muster in the courts.""Interestingli enough, the potenti monetari damag are almost trivial. QCOM ha a cash hoard of $10.8 billion and a market cap of $86 billion.Th real issu then? Well, for Qualcomm stock, it' the threat to the busi model. Accord to the mostrec 10-K, the licens busi gener a juici $6.5 billion in pre-tax earn last year, compar to $2.2 billion for the rest of the other operations.In other words, if the licens arrang are deem to be unfair and anti-competitive, then the ramif could be far-reaching. It would strike a dagger straight into the cash machine. So given this, is it ani wonder that QCOM stock ha been such a terribl investment?Of cours not.Now it' true that there are still some bullish factor at work with Qualcomm stock. The compani ha made some key strateg invest with it chip technologies, which should open up profit opportun with desktop and data centers. To make thi happen, QCOM ha a major partnership with MSFT to use Snapdragon 835 processor for the Window 10 platform.Ther are also some other compel growth opportunities, such as with market for auto and the Internet of Things. In fact, the compani ha made a huge wager on thi opportun with the propos $47 billion acquisit ofNXP Semiconductor NV(NASDAQ:NXPI), which is the world' fifth-largest non-memori semiconductor supplier and it ha a larg chunk of key market for in-vehicl systems, secur identification, near field commun technolog and digit networking.Do the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacl Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Oh, and Qualcomm stock is trade a veri reason valuation. Note that the forward price-to-earn ratio is onli 12X.Bottom Line on Qualcomm StockBut thi may not matter much. A large-cap tech compani can languish for quit a while, especi when there remain uncertainty. And again, with QCOM stock, the problem is that it busi model is under relentless attack. In the meantime, the growth rate for smartphon ha deceler over year as market have becom saturated.So in light of all this, Qualcomm stock realli look more like a bear trap, not an interest valu opportunity.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

"Tech Roundup: GOOGL, MSFT, QCOM, HPE and More",3/15/2017,"Alphabet'sGOOGLCloud Next announc were huge, but didn't dwarf the other big news involv MicrosoftMSFTus QualcommQCOMchip in it servers, or Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEbuy NimbleNMBLor the CIA' alleg hacking.Her are the top stori from last week:Googl Cloud NextAt it Cloud Next confer in California last week, Googl demonstr that it final ha a big growth engin that isn't driven by the search servic it is identifi with. The cloud strategi ha been unfold over the past few year for both Microsoft and Google. But the compani have taken differ approach base on their exist strength and weaknesses. In Google' case, it intent becam clear when it hire VMware founder Diann Green roughli 16 month ago.Green ha clearli work to form, bring in asteadi flow of big clientsinclud Walt Disney, Home Depot, Appl and Snap. At the conference, Googl announc HSBC, eBayEBAY, Colgat Palmol and Verizon indic the grow confid in it platform.Googl also announc a bigcollabor with SAPthat will bring it enterpris applic to the Googl Cloud Platform (GCP). Thi will benefit custom in mani ways, give them access to real-tim insight base on big data and offload more complex task to GCP when constrain for memory. Within a coupl of months, SAP will make it own cloud run on GCP and soon start offer G Suit product includ Gmail and Googl Calendar to it own custom base of more than 345,000 companies, includ most of the world' top 2,000 firms.Ther were also some newenterprise-focus Googl Drive toolsinclud Team Drive (allow administr to create, add and delet team member and assign permiss to them within a share space that will retain share file even when member change); Googl Vault for Drive (that store data on Googl Drive for compani to export, search, hold and retain as required); Drive File Stream (alreadi avail for earli adopters, thi allow you to work directli with file on Drive use applic like Microsoft Word and Adob Photoshop, which updat the chang automat to Drive for access from ani of your devic later); and Quick Access with Team Drive (that use artifici intellig base on an analysi of activity, interact between colleagues, and workday pattern to serv the most relev Googl Drive file at ani given time.And that' not all: Hangout also got an enterpris version calledHangout Chatthat could help with corpor communications.A far as acquisit are concerned, the compani announc a couple: AppBridge, which ha a tool of the same name to facilit migrat of data (along with file permissions) from other storag solut whether it' on-premis devices, cloud services, or hybrid solut to Googl Drive. The second wa Kaggle, which host data and facilit machin learn contests.Wintel Weaken Further as Microsoft Demonstr Qualcomm SoCAt the Open Comput Project (OCP) confer last week, Microsoft wa final abl to demonstr a Window server use the Qualcomm Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-compat server-grad 10nm system-on-chip. Centriq also work with accelerators, multi-host NICs, and storag technolog for workload optimization. The product is part of Project Olympus, Microsoft' next-gener hyperscal cloud hardwar design. To demonstr it commit to the project and open sourc in general, Qualcomm also join Facebook'sFBOCP Foundat as a gold member.For the time being, Microsoft say it will use the server internally, but it' not a big stretch to see thi as a trial run for broader deploy to serv it cloud customers. Microsoft is also work with Cavium' ThunderX2 64-bit ARMv8 server chipset and AMD Napl server processor in order to identifi the best fit and the best valu proposit in differ situations. A suitabl second-sourc to IntelINTCmay lower cost for players, especi in an open sourc environment.Cost reduct is the most import consider at the moment becaus of the huge amount of data that must be made avail for machin learn applic and better web ad targeting. That data is in addit to the amount gener from corpor workload continu to shift to the cloud.If ARM design are to make inroad into the server market, the best place to start is not the enterpris (where comput power is a bigger requirement) but the cloud where less complex oper are requir to be carri out at a faster pace. And that' exactli whi ARM-bas chip from a rang of supplier have been fight for a toe hold.Intel hasn't yet been displac as the performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar leader, which give it tremend leverag to hang on to it nearli 100% market share. It can be said with reason certainti that displac Intel entir won't be easi becaus most of the relat softwar is written for it x86 design and few compani have their own softwar stack make the shift to ARM design cost prohibitive.Key Comments-Microsoft Azure' Leendert van Doorn:""W found that [ARM servers] provid the most valu for our cloud services, specif our intern cloud applic such as search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machin learning. These workload all benefit from high-throughput computing,"" and ""But thi is for intern use only, and that is an import bit, becaus we see an opportun for these class of devic for our own datacent use, but we don't realli see much traction on the enterpris side. We have no plan at thi point to produc an enterpris version of Window Server on ARM.""Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice presid of Qualcomm Data Centers: ""We'r not interest in fell the giant in one fell swoop… We'r go to be chip away.""Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insight & Strategy:""Qualcomm' recent announc Centriq 2400 is bill as the world' first 10nm server processor-bas on an instruct set from ARM Holdings. While Intel' Xeon processor are base on a 14nm architecture, we do not yet know Centriq' die size, power, price or perform , so there' no way to empir compar yet. Also, I am not in the camp of 10nm is alway better than 14nm as Intel' 14nm is superior to other with high performance, high-leakag designs. I am look forward to more Centriq details.""Intel statement:""W oper in a highli competit market and take all competitor seriously,"" and ""We are confid that Xeon processor will continu to deliv the highest perform and lowest total cost of ownership for our cloud customers. However, we understand the desir of our custom to evalu other product offerings."" New chip consolid technolog from it Altera and Nervana acquisit are in the works.HP Buy NimbleHP is fatten up, but in a nice way.Aft split away from the client and printer business, CEO Meg Whitman went on to spin out and merg the enterpris servic busi with Comput Scienc Corp, follow that up with the spin off and merger of it softwar busi with U.K.-bas Micro Focu International. At one time, Michael Dell indirectli comment on the slim strategy, say it wasn't the best way to pursu growth.And now it' appar that that' not the onli thing on Whitman' mind. After snap up Silicon Graphics, SimpliVity, Cloud Cruiser and Niara, the compani ha now gone for one of the hottest tech startup call Nimbl Storage.HP will be pay $1.09 billion in a deal expect to close next month. It will also assum or pay off $200 million in unvest equiti awards.Nimbl broaden HPE' all-flash portfolio for enterpris custom by fill the gap between it 3PAR (StoreServ) high-end array and entry-level MSA storage. It also bring on board the industry-lead predict analyt and manag tool InfoSight. Plus, there' Nimble' Cloud Volum that allow data storag in the public cloud near Amazon AW and Microsoft Azur data centers, facilit data portabl between AW and Azur and cloud-bas computation.No wonder Whitman says, ""Nimbl Storage' portfolio… will help us deliv on our vision of make Hybrid IT simpl for our customers.""To further sweeten things, Nimbl ha said that it current ha more than 10K customers.It' easi to see whi Nimbl would sell out: the compani wa grow revenu strongly, but wa far from profit (30% revenu growth for a 41 cent loss in the last quarter). It also got an offer it couldn't refuse. HPE' global distribut strength, strong brand, and enterpris relationship are thing that can help it scale.Moreover, Nimbl is develop it own hyper converg offer and that is a segment where the realli big player are fight for share. By team up with HPE, it may be abl to fund the signific invest requir (CEO Suresh Vasudevan says: ""We believ that join forc with HPE enabl us to further acceler the pace of innov that ha been a hallmark of our valu proposit to customers"").HP on the other hand is in an increasingli competit market with Dell-EMC, Pure Storage, Kaminario, IBM and NetApp. Cisco is anoth competitor in the hyper converg space. Nimbl doesn't just increas it product breadth and increas it analyt capabl but also bring it greater flexibl to decid it hyper converg strategy. Onli time will tell if the hefti price tag it' pay for Nimbl will be worth it.CIA Hack Affect Big Tech CompaniesAppleAAPL, Google, Samsung, Sony, HTC, Microsoft and Facebook user were appar affect by massiv hack oper of the CIA and other intellig agencies, accord to WikiLeaks, which report the matter in 7,818 web page and 943 attachments. The hack relat to the CIA' Center for Cyber Intellig between 2013 and 2016. The NSA and the UK' GCHQ are also involved. CIA spokesman Heather Fritz Horniak ha said, ""We do not comment on the authent or content of purport intellig documents,"" which mean that the alleg haven't been confirm or proved.But the detail of the report and the promis of more revel in the futur indic that there is suffici reason for concern.Th content is that the CIA discovered, bought or otherwis obtain and exploit secur flaw in Android and iO devic without point them out to Apple/Google. As a result, it is thought that some flaw weren't pick up by their intern team for patching, thu leav them vulner to exploitation. Even encrypt messag on WhatsApp were pick up by the CIA befor they could be encrypted. And even Smart TV were exploit use a techniqu that indic the set wa off when it wa actual on and listen to the convers in the room.Appl is the onli compani to have come out and claim that iO 10 user weren't affect although it couldn't confirm a similar situat with older versions. At the same time, not all flaw were exposed, so Appl may not be in a posit to know for sure. The other compani are look into the matter.Wil You Make a Fortun on the Shift to Electr Cars?Here' anoth stock idea to consider.

Why Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Will Keep on Truckin’,3/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt wa onli a few year ago that investor were wonder whetherAdob System Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) wa in a long-term decline. Photoshop and Flash seem like to be victim of the shift away from desktop usage. Adob earn plung in FY2013 and declin again in fiscal 2014. ADB stock look like dead money.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAdob stock look veri differ now, however. ADB ha almost quadrupl in the last five years.Photoshop and the company' Document segment overal have flatten out, as predicted. But success in Adobe' Market Cloud and Digit Media ha led Adob earn and ADB stock steadili higher.There' no reason to expect a chang in ADB stock come out of the first quarter release, due Thursday. Expect are high, to be sure. But Adob earn have beaten those expect for four straight quarters. Q1 result seem like to drive a fifth straight beat.Adob Earnings: Expect GrowthAgain, expect are high come into Adob earn for the first quarter. Wall Street consensu suggest a 19% increas in revenu and further expans in margins. Earnings-per-shar are expect to rise 30%, to $0.87 from $0.66.The 7 Best IPO to Buy for the Rest of 2017But if that seem like a tall order, bear in mind that both are rel in line with ADB earn and sale guidanc after Q4. (Analyst are expect a bit higher revenu growth, with guidanc suggest an ~18% increase.) And of late, Adob ha had no problem beat it guidanc - and Street estimates.Both FY15 earn abov $2 and FY16 earn abov $3 (both non-GAAP) exceed the company' long-term target laid out after fiscal 2013. In FY16, Adob earn beat consensu - handili - in each of the last four quarters, help drive further gain in ADB stock.Whil the absolut growth rate sound high, estim actual suggest a deceler from fiscal 2016 results. Revenu increas 22% last year, with EP rise nearli 50%. With continu cloud adopt boost both sale and margins, there' littl reason to see much of a slowdown in fiscal 2017. That should lead to Q1 number look solid - and like further gain for Adob stock.Potenti Catalyst for ADB StockHeadlin number aside, the Adob earn releas will have more inform on the company' cloud transition. What ha been impress about Adob is that cloud adopt ha driven higher overal sales.Unlike, say,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), where cloud version of Offic arejust cannib product sales, ADBE' overal top line is growing. The company' ARR (annual recur revenue), a direct measur of strength in cloud services, will be a close watch metric in Q1.One point of concern on that front might be question about whether ARR is go to hit a ceil soon. That figur alreadi repres nearli two-third of Adob revenu in fiscal 2016. If investor worri about potenti diminish return in that initiative, ADB stock could struggl come out of earnings.In addition, Market Cloud result will be close watched, as that' the one area where Adob isn't a domin leader. It Photoshop and Acrobat busi have littl in the way of competition, but cloud-bas market is a tougher field.Adob is go against major competition:Salesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM),Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM), among others. If Adob show that it' take further market share in that business, there' realli noth to stop further growth - and further gain for ADB stock.Finally, oper expens may be close watch as well. While margin and earn have improv steadily, some bear on Adob stock have point to rise spend as a possibl problem onc revenu growth slow down. For now, those invest in sale and G&A are bear fruit. But Adob will need to show disciplin growth.How to Play Adob Stock Into EarningsI'm not sure ADB repres an ideal earn trade. Expect are high: Cowen & Co. upgrad Adob stock to a Buy, with a $140 price target just thi past Friday. The market might shrug off a modest earn beat, given the perform over the last two years, in particular.Target Corpor (TGT) Stock Will Keep Sink Without Thi ChangeThere' no reason to bet against ADB stock, however. The natur of the cloud model make earn rel predict (a a larg portion of revenu is under contract). That would seem to leav littl room for an earn miss.From a longer-term perspective, Adob stock still ha more room to run. Valuat isn't that high, with the stock trade around 31x FY17 guidanc plu it nearli $4 per share in cash. Against ~25% EP growth, that valuat is far from ridiculous. A dividend probabl is on the way soon (Adob alreadi is buy back stock).Th Market Cloud business, in particular, can cement the bull case. A busi with 30%+ oper margin and three domin franchis is alway go to get a bid from investors. And Q1 earn seem like to onli strengthen that case.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the Bills10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowTh postWhi Adob System Incorpor (ADBE) Stock Will Keep on Truckin'appear first onInvestorPlace."

Better Buy: Shopify Inc. (U.S.) vs. Veeva Systems Inc.,3/15/2017,"One of the most import term for forward-look investor to understand is SaaS. Thi four-lett term stand for Software-as-a-Service. And compani that have master Saa are becomingverylucr investments.Perhap the easiest way to envis thi is to rememb what it wa like -- and still is for some -- to installMicrosoft'sOffic Suit onto their computer. And really, 15 year ago, who could afford to go without the bare minimum of Microsoft Word on their computer?makeArticleAd();Th instal process -- use a CD -- wa time consuming, and onli appli to one devic at a time. But now, Microsoft Offic 365 allow pay member to access the softwar via the cloud from ani connect device. Anoth way of think of it is on-demand softwar that you subscrib for.Imag source: Getti Images.But there are lot of other exampl of such technology, and they are gain popular at a breakneck pace.Veeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) provid cloud solut that help drug compani do everyth from manag their sale forc to keep track of FDA clinic test for the drug approv process.Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , on the other hand, is an Saa compani that provid a one-stop shop for ani entrepreneur or medium-s busi to establish an e-commerc presence.Both stock have been veri success as of late, but which is the better buy today? That' imposs to answer with 100% certainty, but there are differ lens through which we can examin the question. Here are three of the most relev and how Shopifi and Veeva compare.Sustain competit advantagesI wish I could go back in time and explain to my beginning-investor self just how import sustain competit advantag are. Often refer to as a ""moat"" by profession investors, thi repres the special someth that keep custom come back month after month, while keep competitor at bay for decades.Th moat for Shopifi and Veeva can be describ in three short words: high switch costs.Let' put ourselv in the shoe of a typic Veeva custom for a second. You'r a medium-s biotechnolog firm. You use Veeva CRM to manag your sale forc -- which includ everyth from a custom database, to secur email communications.Y also use Veeva Vault to captur electron data that' crucial for your FDA approval, and to make sure that you'r abid by all of the relev govern regulations. It took you week to train all of your employe to use and commun on Veeva' platform. But now that they are familiar with the platform, your company' effici ha skyrocketed.How much of a headach would it be -- both from an oper and financi standpoint -- to switch to anoth provid for all of these mission-crit functions? As long as Veeva doesn't start jack up price to the point where they are prohibit expensive, you'd much rather focu your time and energi on your core busi mission.Th same can be said for Shopify. The compani ha three differ tier of subscript to help you start and maintain your e-commerc presence. Onc you reach the highest level, Shopifi can help you not onli manag your website, but it also offer payment process and ship services.Thos are big deals, and if your compani grew up with Shopifi as the platform of choice, you would be equal loath to switch to a differ provid after year of familiarity, data, and train use it products.Both of these compani have veri strong moats, but in the end, thi is a draw.Winn = TieFinanci fortitudeOn import thing to note is that financi fortitud is especi import for young Saa companies. It take enorm up-front invest to set up the infrastructur necessari to becom success in the field. If a compani doesn't have a reliabl cash stash to act as a safeti net, the smallest bit of chao could wipe the balanc sheet clean.Here' how these two compani stack up in term of financi fortitude.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFre Cash FlowShopify$392 million$0($35 million)($10 million)Veeva$346 million$0$54 million$59 millionData source: Yahoo! FinanceI cannot stress enough how import it is that neither Shopifi nor Veeva ha ani long-term debt to speak of. That make them infinit healthy.It' worth mention that becaus these compani oper use a subscription-model, there' often a lag between larg contract be signed, and revenu actual be collected.It' also import to point out that while Shopifi ha yet to be profitable, it should have no problem run it business. With a loss of onli $10 million in cash flow over the past year, there' more than enough cash on hand for the busi to aggress reinvest in growth opportunities.But if we'r forc to choos a winner here, Veeva ha the edg by a nose. Be abl to produc free cash flow is a definit bonus, and one that we shouldn't ignore.Winn = VeevaValuationFinally, we have valuation. While thi isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metric we can consult to give us an idea of how expens each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFP/SShopifyN/AN/A15Veeva6410912Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E repres figur from non-GAAP earnings.Becaus of the aforement cash flow and incom situat at Shopify, thi is a rel easi categori to pick a winner in. Even on the one metric where we do have some apples-to-appl comparison, Shopifi appear to be trade at a 25% premium.Though Veeva isn't cheap by ani stretch of the imagination, it' profit -- and thus, easier to measur it rel value.Winn = VeevaTh winner is...So there you have it: Veeva would appear to be the better bet today. The company' profit give it a slight edg over Shopify. But to be honest, I think these are two of the most excit mid-cap stock to invest in today.Right now, Shopifi is purpos spend alittlemor than it bring in via sale -- so analyst just have to accept that it won't be profit for a while. But in the process, it is captur massiv market share. Combin that market share with high switch cost and all the compani would have to do to be profit is turn off it spend spigot a littl bit and incom would boom.That' whi I ownbothof these stock in my person portfolio, and they combin to make up over 5% of my real-lif holdings. I think you'd do your futur self a huge favor to take a look at both for your own retir portfolio.10 stock we like better than Veeva SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But in the meantime, one intrigu strateg growth opportun for CenturyLink lie with it bud statu as an IT servic and enterpris cloud solut provider.To that end, CenturyLink recent launch it new Cloud Applic Manager, a ""cloud-agnost manag platform"" design to simplifi enterpris customers' deploy of workloads, manag services, and third-parti cloud resourc across hybrid host environments.makeArticleAd();CenturyLink' Cloud Applic manag help autom and manag multipl cloud from a singl interface. Imag source: CenturyLinkOn cloud platform to rule them all...Accord to David Shacochis, CenturyLink VP of Hybrid IT product management:Mani of our custom and partner struggl with the busi challeng of determin the best execut venu for their busi applications. We design Cloud Applic Manag to give our custom a wide varieti of infrastructur option across divers public and privat cloud environments. Cloud Applic Manag help compani avoid vendor lock-in, autom applic deployments, scale workload across dispar host environments, and optim their cost over time.Bett yet, CenturyLink is offer custom the flexibl to use Cloud Applic Manag through either a self-servic model with their own IT staff, or as one activ manag by CenturyLink' team. Cloud Applic Manag also come in either a cloud-bas software-as-a-servic (SaaS) version, or in a ""data center version"" with a virtual applianc that run on-premis in the customer' data center.If all of thi sound familiar, it' like becaus Cloud Applic Manag leverag CenturyLink' $20 millionacquisit of multi-cloud platform specialistElasticBox thi past June.

But those obvious troublesom segment come with their own challenges. And ani rel success CenturyLink can garner through current and forthcom product like Cloud Applic Manag could serv to not onli drive increment revenu themselves, but also afford the compani a perfect segu into CenturyLink' other complementari IT consult and manag servic solutions.Prior to Cloud Applic Manager' formal launch, for example, CenturyLink had alreadi launch other new and expand solut in recent month span manag secur services, Manag SAP and HANA, enterpris cloud and manag big data, and Big Data-as-a-Servic products.

"Intel Corp. and Qualcomm, Inc.: On a Collision Course",3/14/2017,"For years, there ha been veri littl intersect betweenIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) core busi andQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) . Intel' revenu today come primarili from sale of personal-comput processors, processor for enterpris and cloud servers, and network applications.Qualcomm, on the other hand, make most of it profit from licens wireless technolog and patents, and gener most of it revenu by sell chip that go into smartphon and, to a lesser extent, other mobil devic like tablets.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();For years, it ha been wide known that Qualcomm wa work on processor design to attack Intel' data-cent dominance; first commerci shipment are expect to begin in the second half of 2017. And for years, Intel ha been go on about tri to attack Qualcomm' wireless-chip busi -- achiev it first real success last year when it captur cellular-modem share from Qualcomm inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7-seri smartphones.In other words, these two chip giant are on a collis course. Let' look at what each side could lose, what each side stand to gain, and what thi come battl might mean for investor in either company.Intel deal it major -- but potenti onli -- blowIn the past, Intel had told investor that it expect to compet broadli across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the compani said it wa develop a whole stack of chips, design to span everyth from low-end smartphon to what the compani refer to as ""hero devices.""In addit to those chips, Intel had been pursu stand-alon cellular-modem effort for quit some time, though with littl success until recently.Investor might be awar that Intel cancel it pipelin of mobile-processor product and substanti reduc it invest level there. (Intel said at it most recent investor meet that from 2015 to 2017, it spend in mobil will go down about 55%.)So, Intel is, by and large, neutral as a threat to Qualcomm' mobile-processor business.However, the compani won a larg portion of the cellular-modem spot insid Apple' iPhon 7 seri of smartphones, which led to a reason bump in revenu for Intel and a correspond decrement to Qualcomm' revenues.Qualcomm sharpen it knivesThough Intel' mobil effort ultim translat into Qualcomm lose some busi at Apple, Qualcomm' ambit are much more significant.Qualcomm announc that it will be work with softwar giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to bring person comput run Window 10 on Qualcomm' Snapdragon 835 processor to market dure the second half of 2017 -- directli attack Intel' largest business.To make matter wors for Intel (and perhap sweeten the deal for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seem commit to develop data-cent processor for now. Signific share gain on Qualcomm' part (and correspond share loss on Intel' part) -- should they occur -- aren't like to happen overnight.However, Qualcomm' upcom Centriq 2400 chip havealreadi gotten Microsoft' blessingfor it intern use, which lend credibl to the notion that major data-cent custom may be will -- and, frankly, eager -- to work with altern supplier rather than Intel.Th upsid and downsid for each companyFor Intel, the onli upsid I see in thi contest is it potenti to gain some addit cellular-modem share from Qualcomm at Apple. The opportun like isn't that big from the standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenu would like come at a much lower margin than Intel' corpor average. Right now, Intel' abil to hurt Qualcomm in it core wireless-chip busi seem limited.Th upsid for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seem greater. It can take share from Intel in the latter company' core busi of personal-comput chips, as well as it data-cent business, start from essenti zero share.Intel certainli ha signific resourc with which to defend itself, so it' probabl not prudent for investor in either compani to model in substanti market-shar shift to Qualcomm anytim soon. But, in term of which compani ha more to gain and which ha more to lose: The answer come up Qualcomm and Intel, respectively.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"How Intel Corporation's Execution Issues Have Helped Qualcomm, Inc.",3/13/2017,"It' no secret that wireless chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is make all sort of nois about it effort to becom a major player in the market for data center processors. Not onli ha the compani made public it plan to push into thi market, but the chipmak recent announc that it is work close with softwar giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to ""acceler next gener cloud servic on it 10 nanomet Qualcomm Centriq 2400 platform"" and that ""thi collabor will span multipl futur gener of hardware, softwar and system.""You'l notic that Qualcomm love to highlight the fact that it Centriq 2400 is manufactur on a 10-nanomet technology. Thi is intentional, as the market leader that Qualcomm is tri to compet with --Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) -- won't be ship server processor base on it own 10-nanomet technolog anytim soon.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Now, Intel will argu that it 14-nanomet technolog is roughli equival in term of apples-to-appl chip area to the 10-nanomet chip manufactur technolog that Qualcomm is use for it chip (though Intel admit that the foundri 10-nanomet technolog are ahead of it own 14-nanomet technolog in thi respect).That' a reason argument, but here' the uncomfort implic that come from that: Qualcomm' upcom Centriq 2400 processor will still be built on a denser manufactur technolog than Intel' upcom Skylake-bas server processor will.It' clear that Intel' execut problem with respect to both product develop as well as manufactur technolog have help Qualcomm. Let me explain why.Intel' fight with the wrong chipsHad Intel' manufactur and product develop roadmap not gotten off track, it would have launch the Skylak server part in the fall of 2016 and would possibl be prepar it first 10-nanomet server processor for launch in the second half of 2017.In that case -- if Intel' claim that it 10-nanomet technolog is significantli denser than compet 10-nanomet technolog are accur -- Intel would have been time-to-market with Qualcomm' Centriq 2400 server processor with it own 10-nanomet server processor family.Thi would have meant that Intel would have a higher-performing, more power effici famili of product with which to fend off the potenti threat that Qualcomm pose to it lucr data center business.No 10-nanomet for a while for IntelIt is unlik that Intel will bring to market server processor base on it 10-nanomet technolog in 2018, at least base on a leak road map from Dell that' beencircul around the Web.So, if we assum that the first 10-nanomet Intel server processor arriv in the first half of 2019, then it' veri like that Qualcomm will have move past the 10-nanomet Centriq 2400 and will compet with such a part use foundri 7-nanomet technology.Sinc the foundri 7-nanomet technolog are like to be like Intel' 10-nanomet technolog in term of transistor density, it' unlik that Intel will be abl to claim a substanti manufactur technolog densiti lead when it come to data center chips.Conversely, Qualcomm will be abl to market have the ""world' first"" 7-nanomet server chips.Th first step is admit you'v got a problemIt' bad enough that Intel' execut problem have allow a rel newcom to the data center chip market to start bring to market chip use denser technolog than Intel' use. What make it worse, though, is that Intel manag simpli refus to publicli acknowledg that theremightb a problem with it execut that need to be addressed.Indeed, the companystilltel investor that it ha athre year leadin term of the densiti of the manufactur technolog that it bring to market!A long as Intel remain convinc that it ha a ""three year lead"" in term of chip area over it competitors, despit the seriou execut problems, schedul slips, and trail of cancel product left by virtual all of it busi units, then it' unlik that the compani is go to take the action necessari to correct whatev organiz flaw that led to thi situat in the first place.Th first step is admit you have a problem, and when it come to manufactur technology, Intel simpli isn't readi to do that yet.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Microsoft",3/13/2017,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Microsoft Corpor (Symbol: MSFT). So thi week we highlight one interest put contract, and one interest call contract, from the April expir for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $62 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of 70 cents. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 1.1% return against the $62 commitment, or a 9% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to MSFT' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corpor see it share declin 4.3% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $61.30 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the 70 cent from $62), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 9% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annual 9% figur actual exce the 2.4% annual dividend paid by Microsoft Corpor by 6.6%, base on the current share price of $64.76. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to lose 4.28% to reach the $62 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, look at the dividend histori chart for MSFT below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 2.4% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the April expiration, for sharehold of Microsoft Corpor (Symbol: MSFT) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 2.4% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $65.50 strike and collect the premium base on the $1.35 bid, annual to an addit 16.5% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 18.9% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $65.50 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but MSFT share would have to climb 1.1% from current level for that to occur, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 3.2% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Microsoft Corporation, highlight in green where the $62 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $65.50 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the April put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

Can NVIDIA Regain Its Mojo?,3/13/2017,"It seem somewhat disingenu refer to a stock that ha ralli roughli 530% over the last five year as have ""lost it mojo.""However, the fact remain that share of graphic chip leaderNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) have inde fallen roughli 18% from their 52-week high in earli February.makeArticleAd();NVDAdata byYCharts.So, how should investor think about thi newfound bearish in NVIDIA shares? Doe the sell-off in it stock repres a paradigm shift in investor sentiment toward the company, or doe it creat an attract potenti entri point? Let' explor thi topic in greater detail.NVIDIA stock: What goe up must come down?Th onli major news to break sinc NVIDIA' stock peak -- which occur on Februari 7th -- wa the company' releas of it full-year and fourth-quart result for it fiscal year 2017, which took place on Februari 9th. As a quick point of clarification, NVIDIA run it fiscal year one full year ahead of the calendar year, for some odd reason.At ani rate, NVIDIA actual releas earn that exceed analyst estim in term of sale and profits.If anything, it seem safe to say that some investor have been simpli take profit on their NVIDIA investments, a strategi that seem sensibl for short-term investor concern about NVDIIA' admittedli rich valuation. Moreover, while it enjoy mani well-defin positives, there is one potenti storm form on the horizon that could sap some of the wind from NVIDIA' sails.Long-tim graphic laggardAdvanc Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) plan to launch it Vega chip seri later thi year, a move that some analyst believ could allow AMD to steal signific market GPU market share from NVIDIA. Though we don't know ani of the specif regard AMD' Vega chip yet, the hope is that they will serv as a cheaper altern to NVIDIA' GTX chip series, while not sacrif much in the way of performance. If that prove to be the case, NVIDIA could be forc to lower the price of correspond chipsets. Of course, worri about thi is put the cart befor the hors to a certain extent, but it bear note as someth that could inhibit NVIDIA' growth. And given NVIDIA'ssky-high valuation, that could be enough to compel investor sit on larg paper gain to sell.Imag source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA long-term busi outlook remain favorableIn as much as NVIDIA ha inde ""lost it mojo,"" it' import to rememb that NVIDIA' multiyear invest thesi appearsa strong as ever. As we saw in it earn release, the main driver underpin NVIDIA' growth today are high-end gaming, artifici intellig (AI) software, and self-driv cars.eSport still don't receiv a lot of coverag from the mainstream media, but the craze' momentum is undeniable. eSport' global audienc wa estim to reach 256 million viewer in 2016, accord to one industri researcher. Larg event regularli enjoy sponsorship from blue-chip brand likeCoca-Cola,Nissan, and more, which ha led to a dramat increas in purs size for some of the genre' most popular events. This, in turn, ha help increas the awar of the pastim to mani casual fans, particularli in Asia, where the sport is most popular. The same research believ total revenu relat to eSport will reach $1.1 billion by 2019, up from $463 million in 2016. The rush of money and interest into the sport should help continu to creat demand for NVIDIA' best-of-bre graphic process chips, which rose 44% last year.Bett still, major trend like AI softwar and driverless car remain in their earli stages. Last year, NVIDIA saw an unpreced surg in demand for it GPU to power an impress host of applications. NVIDIA' GPU are the chip of choic to power the variou AI project at tech giant such asMicrosoft,Alphabet,Facebook, the Nation Cancer Institute, the U.S. Depart of Energy, and mani others. Turn to self-driv cars, NVIDIA ha also partner with an impress array of major automakers, though thi technolog figur to more meaning contribut to it growth earli next decade.Not to belabor the point, but hope it' clear now that NVIDIA ha far from lost it mojo.

Heres How I Invest My Own Retirement Cash,3/13/2017,"By Brett OwensIt' a question I get a lot, both from member of myContrarian Incom Reportservic and folk who drop by ourContrarianOutlookwebsite:How do you invest your own nest egg?I'l answer it in just a moment.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');I wa remind of thi question again last week, when I wa look at the return of theVanguard Dividend Appreci ETF (VIG)--and think about how dead simpl it would be to beat the fund' return over the long haul.Al it would take is the slightest bit of research.Big on Hype, Short on PerformanceVIG is one of the best case I'v seen of an invest take an inher advantag and get noth out of it.Th fund track the NASDAQ US Dividend Achiev Select Index, which includ 184 compani that have rais their payout annual for at least 10 years. For that reason, it get a lot of airtim from the pundits, who regularli peg it as a proxi for dividend grower in general.And if you'v read my columns, you know I'm a big fan ofdividend-growth stocks.Th reason: they consist rack up some of the market' biggest gains.What I consid the lead studi on the subject, by research firm Ned Davi & Associates, prove it. After sift through 43 years' worth of data, from Januari 1972 through Decemb 2014, Davis' research found that dividend grower top all other type of stocks.It wasn't even close: with a 10.1% averag annual return, they blew away steadi payer (7.1%) and non-pay (2.6%).So VIG should easili beat the S&P 500, then, right?Wrong.Stretch it over ani timeframe: one year, three years, five years, 10 year and sinc VIG' incept in 2006, and at best your return would havejust barelysqueak past the market's.Dividend-Growth Edg Goe AWOLThat' disappointing, given VIG' built-in edge.Now let' go one step further and pick the five fastest dividend grower among VIG' top 10 current hold (without even get into P/E ratios, earn history, revenu growth and the like) over the past decade.Thos five stock areCV Health (CVS), Walgreen Boot Allianc (WBA), Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP)andMedtron (MDT).A quick backtest show that all but one (Medtronic) have outperform VIG:Act Invest Win AgainHold these five would have hand you a 152.3% total return, compar to 110.9% for VIG, as their relentless dividend growth (rang from 150.8% for PepsiCo to a massiv 733.3% for CVS) squeez their share price higher.And that' just the result of a fairli ""dumb"" dividend-growth strategy. Now let' see what happen when we add just a littl more refinement.Which bring me to...Wher My Retir Cash Is Go NowRight now, I'm put 100% of my 401(k) contribut into VIG' cousin, theVanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX).That' becaus I have to choos from a set list of funds, but at least one of them is VDIGX, which is a proven winner.Accord to the prospectus, VDIGX focus on ""high-qual compani that have prospect for long-term total return as a result of their abil to grow earn and their willing to increas dividend over time.""Manag Donald J. Kilbrid also consid factor like valuat and futur dividend-growth potential. That' a much more focus approach than VIG's.Kilbride' stewardship come at a cost, however: the fund' expens ratio is 0.33%, more than three time higher than VIG' 0.09%. But he' earn hi keep, deliv a total return that' crush VIG and the market sinc VDIGX' incept in Februari 2006 (net of fees, of course):Th Power of a Focus Dividend-Growth StrategyBut if you'r think of buy VDIGX now, you'r out of luck. Vanguard close the fund to new investor in Juli 2016.Even so, as with VIG, we can do an end run around that and pick the five fastest dividend grower (again over the past 10 years) from among VDIGX' top 10 holdings, which combin make up 29.8% of the portfolio.Here, we'r get both fast dividend growthandpiggyback on Kilbride' eye for valu and dividend-growth potential.Thes stock are:Microsoft (MSFT), Costco Wholesal (COST), Chubb (CB), Medtron (MDT)andUnion Pacif (UNP).(For thi back test, I'v left outCanadian Nation Railway (CNI),whos dividend growth would have qualifi it in Canadian-dollar term but fall short when convert to US funds.)Again, we see the same result: four of these five beat VDIGX, with the sole exception, again, be Medtronic:Act Investing: 2, Passive: 0What' more, these five dividend grower gener a combin total return of 244.5%. That'sfarmor than the 152.3% we squeez out of our five VIG selections.It also neatli captur the power of combin dividend growth with bargain valuations, a strong earn histori and other sign of payout strength.Th bottom line? Invest in a ""dumb"" dividend-growth ETF is okay. A ""smart"" one is better, and pick your own dividend grower (which, by the way, is how I invest my person retir stash) is hands-down the best way to go.Th Sweet Spot: 8% YieldsWithDividend GrowthDividend growth is great, but none of the stock abov yield more than 2.8% today. What if you need big dividend incomenowso you can retir comfortably?Aft all,2.8% just won't cut it unless you'r rich already!But you can retir on as littl as $500,000 today by focus on stealth incom play such as closed-end fund (CEFs), prefer share and real estat invest trust (REITs). In mani cases, these issu pay secur yield of 8% or better--with dividend growth to boot!Thi meansyou'r assur yourself of 10%+ annual returns, with most of that come as cash dividends!Thes vehicl are safe, but they aren't as well known as your typic (and usual expensive) blue chip. And that'sgoodfor us, becaus we can lock up secur incom stream of 8% or more while enjoy payout growth and price upside, too.Th 6 bargain buy I want to show you today are perfect for 2017. Becaus no matter what happen in Washington or with the Fed, these 8% payer are go to becom increasingli popular with retire as they'r discovered. Make sure you buy them now, befor their price get bid up (and their yield get squeezed).Click here for full detail on my favorit 8% play in funds, prefer and REITs--and I'll share the names, ticker and buy price with you, too."

The sheer number of everyday applic for such a technolog ha prompt Grand View Research to project the global market for voic recognit technolog will reach $128 billion annual by 2024, an estim that may undershoot the overal econom opportun at play consid the potenti vertic includ healthcare, defense, entertainment, consum goods, and more (I'll discuss these in more detail in Part II).Ther is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voic comput is extrem like to transform the way we interact with technolog in society, but befor that can happen, a large-scal societ shift toward adopt the interfac must occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until sever key hurdl are overcome.Understand the challeng aheadTo analyz those obstacles, let' turn to the most promis applic of voice-driven technolog today: virtual digit assistants.Data Sources: Socrat Technologies, Vantiv, Statista. Chart by AuthorThank to the success of the iPhon andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is current the most wildli use virtual assist in the Unit States, but until recently, it' also perfectli exemplifi what' hold voic comput back. To put it simply, speak with Siri can often feel more like a novelti than a time-saver, a sentiment share not just among Appl users, but most smartphon owner with access to similar voic comput technology.It' a problem we can break down into three fundament hurdles.Th first is that user must often resort to awkward combin of hyper-specif phrase and hurri robo-speak to have their speech accur recognized. Andrew Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respect name in the field, perhap put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech recognition, depend on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So mayb it get one word in 20 wrong. That' realli annoy if it get one in 20 wrong and you probabl don't want to use it veri often. That' probabl where speech recognit is today.""Th second hurdl is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remain a strong chanc it will bemisinterpretedwhil undergo natur languag understanding, a process in which the assist attempt to comprehend what we want use the sequenc of word (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctli understood, an assist may still simpli be unabl to solv for the request due to technic constraints. Exampl of both case can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sens of how frustrat the encount can be.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneEncount like these make us feel as though we'r wast our time trust our phone to do what we could have done ourselv with onli a littl more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventu discourag us from even tryingto use our assist for anyth complex, instead reli on them onli for the most trivial of tasks, like set alarm or creat reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdl are solvabl with data, third-parti partnerships, and time, each of which the major player in thi space have been activ accru for years. Return to our example, sinc Siri wa introduc to the world in 2011, virtual assist have grown far more capabl of correctli interpret request thank to advanc in deep learning, a thrive field of AI be util byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and other to improv speech recognition, natur languag understanding, and other compon of voic comput at astound rates. (Click herefor an outstand stori byTh New York Timeson Google' signific role in make thi happen).Equ as important, decis by Appl and it competitor to open their platform up to third-parti servic have made today' voice-bas assist feel far more capabl than in year past. These decis allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride use your Uber account, or order a pizza through your storedDomino'sinform -- not unlik anactualsecretari would do.A the potenti behind voic comput becom increasingli obviou in the come month and years, we should expect more and more third parti to hop on board, eventu expand the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of order an Uber, imagin order a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-parti command avail on Amazon' voice-bas assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technic achiev and partnership will continu compounding, eventu make for a highli practic voic comput experience. Even margin improv in the technolog will convinc user to begin use voic as an interfac more frequently. In the same talk regard the current state of the voic industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as speech recognit accuraci goe from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from bare use it today, to use it all the time."" He added, ""Most peopl underestim the differ between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer.""Although we'r not yet abl to predict when the technolog will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is ani indic -- sinc Ng' speech, Baidu ha built a program capabl of dictat English three time faster, and with 20% less errors, than human be -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguabl far more import hurdl stand in the way. It' a problem share by everi other major comput medium in use today, onli voic is actual solv for it.An instantan comput experienceNo matter the medium, we'v alway interact with comput by issu commands. In the 1950s, we meticul punch those command into card befor feed them into hulk machines. Now, technolog allow us to simpli type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despit these advancements, today' medium still subject user to a uniqu set of delays, a sort of friction that inher slow down the process betweenthinkinga command and actual be abl tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decad ago, that friction most like entail track down a PC with internet, use the mous to open a browser, use the keyboard to run a search, and then sort for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simpli mean reach into our pocket for our phone, scroll with our thumb, and tap away.It' a process so effortless, the averag American now check their phone an estim 46 time per day. It' even becom fashion to argu there' no longerenoughfrict separ societi from our devices; that we'retooplug in to the digit world.So when you consid that voic computing' primari advantag iseliminatingfriction, it becom tempt to dismiss the technolog as a solut to a trivial problem. What that argument critic fail to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simpl convenience, and that ani amount of friction, no matter how small, fundament limit the dynam between a user and their comput medium in two ways.Let' take the smartphon for example.Imag Source: PixabayTh seemingli trivial motion we make when reach for our phone still requir us to be in immedi proxim of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to rememb it' on the counter even befor we can do that. Then, onc we'v reach our phone, we'r requir to physic handl it, a process that gener requir we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limit forc our comput experi to revolv around the locat of our device, as oppos to it revolv around us.They can creat roadblock for those with disabl affect their vision or hand (or really, even those who just have sticki hands, wet hands, or their hand full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immedi comput need.There' a reason speech is our most instinctu form of communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouth and ask. We do that becaus it' instantaneous. Now contrast that with have to locat your phone, have to type in your password, have to navig to an app, have to tap, type, or speak your command. These behavior are not instinctual,but we put up with them becaus the peopl around us usual don't have the answers, and becaus smartphon are our best alternative.But they don't have to be.Th rise of voiceIt' not obviou quit yet, but today' physic bound medium have left a larg hole to fill and voic comput is start to fill it.Ov the past two years, the technolog ha begun manifest itself in the form of always-on, always-listen devic abl to virtual bypass the friction inher in today' major comput mediums. Currently, these devic are best exemplifi by Amazon' line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voic recognit technolog allow user to command Alexa from across multipl room and through variou background nois at ani time simpli by call for it out loud.Imag Source: Amazon.com.Put anoth way, for as littl as $50, Amazon' Echo is give consum their first glimps at a frictionless comput experience. Follow it initi setup, there' no press buttons, no look around for the device, and no navig through screen to issu a command. When it work correctli (like Siri, Alexa is still veri much in it infanc and subject to misinterpret commands) it realli doe allow user to convert their thought to a command in the time it take to form a sentence, captur the essenti promis of voic as a medium.And if the earli estim adopt rate for the devic is ani indic -- Amazon hasn't offici releas sale figures, but as of Januari 2016, Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) estim a stagger 8.2 million Echo have alreadi been sold in the U.S. (a number that pale in comparison to Morgan Stanley' estim of over 11 million), suggest the devic ha achiev well over 5% household penetr -- earli demand for a seamless comput experi is strong, and will like grow stronger as capabl competitor race to introduc their own offer (see Google' Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu' Littl Fish), and as voic recognition, natur languag understanding, and third-parti support continu improv at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figur are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devic will never replac today' exist comput mediums, but will rather augment them. While screen will remain the prefer medium for our more detail and visual comput needs, voic will begin it ascent by take on an increas share of our more ""conversational"" demands, common request we want address with the immediaci we expect from dialogu (""Cancel my doctor' appointment."" ""Paus that music!"" ""What' a good non-fict book to read on the beach? ... Great, order that one."")A the technolog grow capabl of handl increasingli nuanc and complex requests, and as voice-en devic prolifer and evolve, we can expect more user to grow comfort engag with the technolog around the home, in the workplace, and gradual more pervas aspect of society.Andthat'swher the real opportun begin.Th opportun at handSom of the biggest tech empir in modern histori have been built around the person computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which ha provid the infrastructur for technolog to penetr deeper and more reflex into everyday life, allow creativ compani to reach consum in entir new ways.In just 10 years, the iPhon help Appl grow to becom the largest corpor in the world, but it also popular smartphon technolog in the U.S., help to creat the infrastructur that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless other to creat busi that reach deeper into our live than ani before.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneAnd yet voic technolog is go deeper.It' becom an invisible, always-listen medium that surround us, weav itself more seamlessli into the fabric of our live than ani befor it.

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Microsoft Corporation,3/11/2017,"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) share ralli 24% over the past 12 months, hit a histor high and outperform the S&P 500' 18% gain. However, that ralli also boost Microsoft' trail P/E to 30, which is slightli higher than the industri averag of 29 for busi softwar companies.Som investor may believ that premium put a near-term ceil over Microsoft' stock price. While that may be true, Microsoft can still probabl climb higher over the long term thank to three major catalysts.Imag source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();1. It grow cloud ecosystemBack in 2015, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella declar that Microsoft would gener $20 billion in annual cloud revenu by the end of fiscal 2018. At the time, it commerci cloud busi had an annual run rate of $6.3 billion. That figur top $14 billion last quarter -- indic that it could hit Nadella' target and account for nearli a fifth of the company' estim revenu in 2018.Most of Microsoft' cloud revenu come from it main cloud services, Offic 365, Outlook, and the Dynam CRM (custom relationship management) platform. A smaller portion come from it cloud platform Azure, which lend out storage, comput power, analytics, and develop tool to enterpris customers. Microsoft doesn't disclos Azure' exact sale figures, but it claim that it revenu rose 93% annual and it comput usag more than doubl last quarter. All that growth could offset Microsoft' biggest weak -- it slow sale of Window licenses.2. It disrupt move into new marketsMicrosoft' biggest mistak over the past decad wa miss the technolog shift toward mobil devices, which left it chain to the age PC platform as iO and Android devic flood the market. But under Nadella, Microsoft is push back with disrupt move of it own.It acquisit of LinkedIn enhanc Dynam with more enterpris data, which can help it challeng CRM market leaderSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) . Tighter connect between LinkedIn, Offic 365, and Outlook can also widen the moat of it enterpris tool against challeng like Google' G Suite. Microsoft' recent introduct of Teams, which merg Skype for Business, Offic 365, OneNote, and other featur on a cloud-bas collabor platform, counter similar platform like Slack andCisco' Spark.Microsoft' HoloLens. Imag source: Microsoft.Microsoft also made bold move on the hardwar front. It recent announc that it had alreadysold ""thousands""of HoloLen AR headset develop kits, and the upcom Window 10 Creator updat will add 3D imag captur and edit tool to let artist and develop creat 3D object which can be view in the headset. Microsoft also announc that it hardwar partner will launch high-end VR headsetsstart at $300-- about half the price of an Oculu Rift. Those move could all put Microsoft ahead of the tech curv again.3. Embrac ARM-bas devices, Android, and iOSMicrosoft onc had a misplac devot to x86 processor and it own oper system. By stick withIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) x86 chip instead of support ARM chips, Microsoft lock itself out of the smartphon and tablet markets, which overwhelmingli use ARM' more power-effici processors. The compani eventu pivot toward ARM chip with Window RT and Window Phone, but app for those devic were initi incompat with older x86-base machines.To move past that awkward phase, Microsoft launch new version of Window 10 which were fulli compat with both Intel' x86 chip andQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) ARM-bas Snapdragon chips. It also recent announc that it will run it Azur cloud platform on Qualcomm' ARM-bas Centriq 2400 server solutions. These move could hurt Intel' domin of the PC and data center markets.A for mobil devices, it' clear that Window Phone and Window 10 Mobil -- which run on less than 1% of smartphon worldwid -- were failures. But instead of push out more expens hardware, Microsoft downsiz it mobil busi and focus on launch more app for Android and iOS. Thi meant that PC user could still access Microsoft' Offic 365, Outlook, OneDrive, and other servic on the go even if they didn't own a Window Phone -- which keep Microsoft relev in the ""mobile-first, cloud-first world"" which Nadella discuss at the begin of hi tenure.Th key takeawaysUnd former CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft complac milk it Window and Offic cash cows. That complac caus it to miss the shift toward cloud servic and mobil devices, but Satya Nadella seem to know how to get the compani back on track.Und Nadella, Microsoft is focus on the busi that work, like the cloud, and reduc it exposur to costli mobil hardware. Microsoft is also invest in the futur by expand it enterpris ecosystem and develop new AR and VR hardware. To me, all these move indic that Microsoft' best day are still ahead.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is This NVIDIA's Next Big Opportunity?,3/11/2017,"Imag source: NVIDIA.Gam isNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) biggest revenu sourc while the automot busi is said to be it nextbig play. However, the company' data center busi -- which hasAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as client -- is put both game and automot to shame in term of growth.makeArticleAd();Data from NVIDIA. Chart by author.Th 205% year-over-year growth in NVIDIA' data center revenu dure the fourth quarter eclips both game and automotive, which report ""moderate"" growth of 66% and 37%, respect over the same time period. Data center is the company' second-largest business, with over 13% of revenue, and it could continu to grow for two reasons: the deploy of more data center and upgrad to the exist ones.Data center will need more GPUsNowadays, the type and volum of inform that data center process ha becom more complex than ever. The grow usag of 3D applic in virtual workspac environ is creat the need for high-perform comput that is enabl by GPUs. Instead of deploy a 3D-graphics-en applic on an individu workstation, enterpris are now use the data center to instal the 3D app so they can be access by user remotely.Apart from the complexity, the volum of data process in data center is also rise thank to concept such as the Internet of Things.TheInternet of Thingsgener two categori of data. The first is the larg data type that consist of imag and video gener by differ electron devices. The second is the passiv or small data type that is gener by differ sensor and low-energi devic power the Internet of Things. As data center handl both these data types, they will need upgrad GPU to enhanc comput speed and control cost simultaneously.A it turn out, NVIDIA' Tesla GPU for the data center deliv on both count -- faster speed and lower costs. These are capabl of enhanc comput speed by five time and reduc cost by 60%, accord to Shanker Trivedi, the company' VP of Enterpris Business. The advantag deliv by these GPU have allow the compani to rack up an impress clientel in datacenters, especi in high-perform computing.NVIDIA' GPU are power major cloud servic provid such as Amazon Web Services,GoogleCloud, Microsoft Azure, and Softlayer. The company' client list in datacent will continu expand as global mobil data traffic is expect to grow eightfold from 2015 to 2020, driven by Internet of Thing applications.Th increas data traffic will spawn the need for more datacenters, with TechNavio forecast that the global data center market will grow 11% annual between 2016 and 2020. But, apart from the construct of new datacenters, NVIDIA will also benefit from the upgrad to the exist ones.Upgrad will drive GPU demandCloud servic provid have start upgrad their exist data center to meet the rise in data volum and tackl complexity. Amazon, for example, upgrad it servic use NVIDIA' Tesla GPU acceler late last year. Amazon Web Servic use eight Tesla accelerators, with each of them be power by a pair of GPUs.Th NVIDIA GPU were use to add a new virtual server, known as P2, to Amazon' data center. The new server carri seven time the comput capac of Amazon' previou platform, known as G2, which wa run a legaci GPU.Similarly, Microsoft ha also start offer a preview of NVIDIA' acceler data center solut on the Azur platform to give custom a tast of supercomputer-class performance. Azur client can now deploy profession grade graphic solut to remot workstat and acceler their comput speed over the cloud. In thi way, Microsoft is provid infrastructure-as-a-servic (IaaS) to it client by upgrad it exist data centers.Th Iaa market will be worth $43 billion in 2020 as compar to $22 billion last year, accord to IDC. Thi will increas the demand for NVIDIA' GPU as they will be use to acceler comput power and capac in data center to enabl Iaa growth.Th Foolish takeawayTh data center market is go to get bigger in the long run and NVIDIA count the biggest cloud servic provid as it clients. Thi will allow it to get more of it GPU into data center to enabl high-perform comput need and eventu boost it business.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Today' articl is the last one of thi seri and I will cover a few other topic that I call miscellan (I am not heedingCharli Munger(Trades,Portfolio) 's suggest on avoid sloth).On how special in life can make a big difference:""Generally, special is the way to go for most people. It' just I'm an exampl of someth different. It' awkward for me becaus I don't want to encourag peopl to tri to do it the way I did, becaus I onli go to work for most people. The basic idea for be ration and disciplin and defer gratification, those will work. But if you want to get rich the way I did, by learn a littl bit about a hell of a lot, I don't recommend it to others.""makeArticleAd();""I basic think John Bogl is right about hi basic approach, that peopl are not go to match the averages, and he is. Hi idea ha succeed and he' succeed and he wa right. On the other hand, he' kind of a one-trick pony. I don't think he ha anoth ... he had one good idea in hi lifetime. He rode it veri hard. It' all you need. He' anoth example. He had one good idea, he push it hard and it worked. You don't need a lot of good ideas, but you do need one."""" Gore had come into you fellows' business. Al Gore is in your busi and he ha made 300 or 400 million dollar in your business. He' not veri smart. He drank a lot, he smoke a lot of pot. Coax through Harvard with a gentleman' C. He had one obsess idea, that global warm wa a terribl thing, and he said he'd protect the world from it. Hi idea when he went into invest counsel is he wa not go to put ani carbon dioxid in the air. He found some partner to go into invest counsel with and he says, 'We'r not go to have ani carbon dioxide.' Thi partner' a valu investor, a good one.What they did is Gore hire a staff to find peopl who didn't put carbon dioxid in the air. Of course, that put him into servic companies.Microsoft(MSFT) and all these servic compani who were just ideal located, and thi valu investor pick the best servic companies. All of a sudden, the client are make hundr of million of dollar and they'r pay part of it to Al Gore. And now Al Gore ha hundr of million of dollar in your profess and he' an idiot. It' an interest story.""""There' a leverag buyout oper in Lo Angel that I know casually. He' made 35% per annum for 30 years. All he buy is servic companies. Instead of buy 100%, while leav manag to have 10, he alway tri to buy 60 and let the old manag who creat the compani own the other 40. He buy noth but servic companies, and he know a lot about it. With that formula, inventories, receivables, there are all kind of horribl thing in busi that if you just buy servic compani you can avoid. It' amaz how it' work for thi guy, who doe the buyouts, it wa just the way it work for Al Gore. Thirty-f percent per annum. He' smart becaus he' caus peopl to have more of their own skin in the game, they know more about it. They'r more like partner instead of ... the new manager' not an employee. If some other guy own 40 and you own 60, that' a differ relation-ship, and he' the founder. What a clever way to do it. And it work better.

If your marriag reason work and if your famili life reason works, and I don't mean perfectli becaus nobody' famili life work perfectly, particularli with the children, and if your partnership work well, we have had marvel part-ners. Warren' been a marvel partner for me, I'v been a good partner with him. All of our other subsidiari partnerships, which don't overlap totally, have been marvelous. I do not have a big fail partnership of ani kind. That' becaus I am a good partner and Warren is a good partner. You want a good spouse, deserv one. If you want to have a good partner, be a good partner. It' a veri simpl system and it' work veri well, and of cours it wouldn't work veri well without it. Also get rid of the bureaucracy. You deal with good peopl you trust. Expense, trouble, lawyers, checking, we'r all close someth with no audit. We basic are veri old-fashioned. We bought the Northern Natur pipelines. We need money Monday and it wa Saturday, it wa lot of money. We just gave them the money and took the pipeline, work out the detail later. Other peopl can't do that. Their whole cultur is there are all kind of bureaucrat that want someth to do, they can't make an exception.""On cloning:""Wel clone is, of course, it' not a veri ambigu word when you use it biologically, but when you take it into some other field, clon- is a veri interest idea. You do remov idea from one place and bring them into another. If that' cloning, I do it all the time.It' a veri plausibl idea and I'v encourag one young man to look at it.

Report that it new (and well-hyped) comput processor wasn't perform quit as well as expect onc put to the test in real-world applications.A Ar Technica review Mark Walton put it:""Th [Ryzen] 1800X lag behind it Intel counterpart in gaming, regardless of whether it' run at the same clock speed or higher.""It wa a real blow to optimist investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hope that the new CPU would be the centerpiec of a turnaround story. Now that stori is in question.Th is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company' rebound as it' been made it to be. Indeed, Advanc Micro Devic ha a lot more go for it besid the new CPU that investor aren't give it credit for. Three specif item come to mind. Note than a hand of AMD' competitor are now becom partners.3 Thing AMD Still Ha Go For ItWhil investor had high expect for Ryzen, the futur for Advanc Micro Devic isn't depend on it. In fact, there are three other area that may end up mean even more for it top and bottom lines.9 Stock to Buy That Are Grow Faster Than AmazonIn no particular order …Penetr the Cloud Market:Whil AMD ha alway had a presenc in most key tech markets, cloud comput wa never a key one for the company. That' chang now though… a ball that got roll just in the past few weeks. In November,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl divis tap AMD,look to add it graphic processor unit to Google' machin learn architecture.It' a curiou development, as GPU chip weren't design to do anyth more than handl a computer' display screen. As it turn out, though, it GPU are veri capabl of parallel computing, which is a critic aspect of thi new cloud-bas function.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) select AMD processor to power it next-gener open cours cloud platform.At stake is a piec of the cloud infrastructur market worth an estim $300 billion per year.Mor Licens Revenue:It' onli an unconfirm rumor thu far, but a reason credibl one. That is,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedli interest in use AMD Radeon graphic technolog to power Intel' integr GPU in futur comput … displacingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel end at the end of March.At the veri least, the prospect of such an IP licens deal could mean a coupl hundr million dollar in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel realli want to step up it game, though, it could help fund improv in the way it CPU handl graphics.New GPU Will Enhanc New CPU Revenue:Whil the review for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holder should bear in mind that they'r onli half the next gener of hardwar for Advanc Micro Devices.Th other half of the one-two punch combin for AMD thi year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveil around the middl of thi year.A wa note back on Feb. 7:""Vega, is a second-gener high bandwidth memori (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memori architectur that perform significantli better than the more common GDDR5 (doubl data rate type-five) util by most graphic process unit today. An essentially-infinit amount of memori can be dedic to handl the display - the maximum virtual is cap at a ridicul 512 terabytes. Thi platform is about twice as power as most current alternatives, and will make Advanc Micro Devic competit with the newest gener of GPU architectur from Nvidia, call Pascal.""Mor important, Vega wa larg built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each get the most perform out of one another.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at Thi PriceIn the meantime, it' not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause.A the company' CEO Lisa Su recent explained, ""We hear peopl on want to see improv 1080p perform and we fulli expect that Ryzen perform in 1080p will onli get better as develop get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ develop now work with 'Zen' and sever of the develop for Ash of Singular and Total [War:] Warhamm are activ optim now.""Bottom Line for AMD StockA encourag as the futur may be for the compani whether or not Ryzen end up perform well, there' still no deni that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is noth compar to 2016' huge rally.But don't confus ani futur weak from AMD as evid of what' in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanc Micro Devic is veri well posit for a great 2017. The trick is just be patient enough to wait for a truli palat entri price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it' almost uncomfort to do so. We aren't there yet.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Reason Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

But investor shouldn't overlook it attractiveness. Apple' dividend easili make up what it lack in yield with growth potential.Currently, Appl is pay out just 27% of it earnings, leav signific upsid for dividend increas in the future. Further, manag ha demonstr how it' priorit dividend growth sinc the compani initi it dividend in 2012. Adjust for a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014, Apple' dividend ha increas 50% sinc 2012.Apple' annual dividend increas have steadili remain at about 10% -- a rate the compani look like it could sustain for year to come.IBM: an above-averag yieldWith a dividend yield of about 3.1%, IBM ha the fattest per-shar payout of these three stocks. Even more, while IBM' 44% payout ratio -- the percentag of annual earn it is pay out in dividend -- is well abov Apple' 27% payout ratio, it' still low enough for investor to expect meaning dividend growth for year to come.Indeed, IBM' dividend ha grown at a veri healthi averag annual rate of about 14% dure the past five years. However, the company' most recent dividend increas wasn't as substanti as in past years. In 2016, IBM' dividend increas 7.7%, down from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songo transformationha put pressur on net income.Despit the slowdown in IBM' dividend increases, the company' 21 consecut year of dividend increases, along with it low payout ratio, set a solid preced for ongo dividend increas over the long haul.Microsoft: endur cash flow from a profit busi modelMicrosoft' abil to gener headi level of cash flow from it profit busi model is undeniable. For the past 10 years, Microsoft' gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentag of revenue, ha been between about 61% and 81%. Sure, the softwar giant' gross profit margin is on the low end of thi rang today -- at 61%. But the inher profit of Microsoft' software-focus business, combin with the sticki of it Offic suit and it enterpris applic and services, mean it can count on endur cash flow for year to come, to continu feed investor solid dividends.Imag source: Getti Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offer investor a better dividend yield than Apple, but it' still well behind IBM' 3.1% dividend yield.

Recent one-tim charg against earn and restructur charg have suppress net incom and push the company' payout ratio higher. By comparison, Appl and IBM are pay out 23% and 41% of their free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft' most recent annual increas wa 8% -- and the company' financi look set to support similar increas over time.In general, incom investor may not find mani great dividend stock in tech. But these three stock are just as worthi of a spot in an incom portfolio as go-to Dividend Aristocrat in consum staples, utilities, and banking.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cavium Inc.'s Thunder X2 Aims for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud,3/9/2017,"Data center chipmakerCavium(NASDAQ: CAVM) announc on March 8 that it is ""collabor withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) on evalu and enabl a varieti of cloud workload run on [its] flagship Thunder X2 ARMv8-A Data Center processor for the Microsoft Azur cloud platform.""Th announc goe on to say that Cavium and Microsoft are ""demonstr web servic on a version of Window Server develop for Microsoft' intern use run cloud servic workload on Thunder X2.""Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Thi announc is similar to one that fellow ARM-bas server processor makerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)mad at the same time.Let' take a closer look at what thi announc mean for Cavium in the near term and potenti over the long term.Near term? Probabl not muchTh word of Cavium' press releas appear care construct to avoid give the impress that Microsoft is plan to buy and deploy a bunch of Cavium' Thunder X2 chip in it data center anytim soon.Indeed, the phrase ""evalu and enabling"" as well as the word ""demonstrating"" seem away away from ""plan to deploy in signific quantities.""So, in the near term, I don't expect the joint work that Microsoft and Cavium are do to lead to signific revenu for Cavium anytim soon. The work that these two compani are do is much more like to lay the groundwork for Microsoft to be abl to deploy potenti successor to the Thunder X2 -- should those product meet Microsoft' need for certain workloads.Tak a longer-term viewAt thi point, it' start to look as though Cavium and Qualcomm are the onli two merchant ARM-bas server processor vendor left in in the game (there are compani build chip for their own intern use like Huawei, for example).Cavium' edg appear to be it heritag is as a data center/network processor vendor (Qualcomm hail from a mobil processor background), but Qualcomm ha significantli greater financi resourc to tri to slug it out with market incumbentIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .It' like not go to be easi for either compani to wrest away signific market share from Intel to begin with (which invest more in data center-specif technolog and market than either Qualcomm or Cavium -- probabl more than both combined), and that difficulti is compound by the fact that Cavium and Qualcomm must compet against each other, too.Success for ARM server chip vendor like Qualcomm and Cavium is, in general, not someth that' guarante to come at all, and if it doe come, it'll be hard won over multipl year after substanti invest in research and development, software/ecosystem enablement, and market efforts.It' worth note that on Cavium' most recent earn call, CEO Sy Ali said that the compani ""expect[s] to releas [its] next gener products"" in 2017. Given that the compani had previous said that it would begin sampl Thunder X2 in the begin of 2017, I'd expect shipment for revenu to occur late in the year.What investor need to keep an eye on, then, is what kind of revenu ramp Cavium ultim begin to experi with Thunder X2 and the impact it start have on the company' financials, independ of thi announc from Microsoft.10 stock we like better than Cavium NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal,3/9/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeak releas ""Vault 7,"" a huge collect of document that reveal hack tool use by the CIA. While the dump paint the CIA in an unflatt light, the fallout may well be wors for some of the world' largest tech companies, includingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA ha a long list of iO exploit it ha use to gain access to iPhones. Despit be name along with numer other giant of tech, the latest WikiLeak dump actual highlight a key advantag for Appl in particular.And while it aura of secur may emerg tarnished, the iPhon may actual come out ahead over the long term thank to WikiLeaks.What Wa in WikiLeak Vault 7?The latestWikiLeak dump involv 8,761 documentsoutlin a wide rang of CIA hack tools, includ viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojan and remot control systems.In addit there are 14 iO exploit listed, sever dozen Android vulner and method for access encrypt chat (essenti read the contentsbeforethey are encrypt by gain access to the host device).9 Stock to Buy That Are Grow Faster Than AmazonIt' not all smartphones, either. The CIA ha developedmalwar to infect computersrun macOS, Window and Linux. It' even capabl of turn Samsung Smart TV on their owners, use them as listen devic to record conversations.Thi Doesn't Look Good for AppleAppl ha long posit itself as a privaci advocate. It ha alway play up the secur of the iPhon and evenrefus an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneus by a shooter in 2015' San Bernardino terrorist attack.Appl CEO Tim Cook releas a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. govern ha ask us for someth we simpli do not have, and someth we consid too danger to create. They have ask us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""Th WikiLeak Vault 7 releas made it clear that iO wasn't as secur as Appl had thought.How Appl Could Come Out AheadWikiLeak is bad news for Appl in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hack of mobil devic and consum electron could actual be good news for the compani in the long run. Appl quickli went on record as say mani of the vulner identifi in the WikiLeak Vault 7 documentswer alreadi address with iO 10. And it is work to identifi and patch ani new issues.Appl and Googl chose veri differ strategi when it come to smartphones. Appl control everi aspect of iO - it mobil oper system - as well as the hardware. It push out new major new iO version yearli and updat releas (the kind that fix bug or secur issues) on demand. As a result,nearli 80% of all iPhon are current run iO 10.Googl also releas new version of Android yearly, but larg reli on smartphon manufactur and wireless carrier to approv and push updates. They have littl incent to do so, sinc lack the latest Android featur could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildli vari assort of smartphones, updat can often be problematic, lead to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajor are run softwar releas in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddress most of the issu in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundr of million of Android devic that could still be affectedbecaus they'r run old software. Most iPhon users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assur that Apple' consist program of releas will address ani outstand issues.Appl ha a similar approach with macOS. It updat it Mac comput oper system regularli and push out secur updat as issu are discovered. With the smart home,Appl take extrem secur measures, includ costli custom chips, factori inspect and end-to-end encrypt between connect devices. Thi approach ha meant slower adopt for it HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of be far more secur than the competition.A for smart TV eavesdrop on you, that' just anoth reason to buy a rel inexpens stream box - like an Appl TV - instead.Th Age of Privaci Is OverMani peopl had been live with a probabl naiv expect that everyth they did with their smartphon wa privat and secure, especi when use encrypt apps. The latest WikiLeak dump should end that notion and leav peopl watch their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aim to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time thi play out, it' also like to make it clearer than ever befor that some product are more secur than others, and some compani are in a better posit to fix ani vulnerabilities.Appl may have been name as one of the victim of CIA hacking, but it wa quick to respond and quick to make it clear mani of the WikiLeak exploit have alreadi been addressed.

"AI Deep Dive: NVDA, IBM, CRM",3/9/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();Last June I wrote a special report forZack Confidentialcal ""Big Econom Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics.""Whil research and talk about science-fict technolog like machin learn and artifici intellig is alway fun, I began that report with a more import and sober premise: whi ten of million of job global were about to be elimin in the next decade.Thi assert came from research publish in Januari of 2016 by Citi and the Oxford Martin School explor the vari impact that autom would have on job and economi in major countri around the world.Here' what I wrote last June...Technolog at Work v2.0: The Futur Is Not What It Use to Be build on 2013 research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborn which found that 47 per cent of US job were at risk of autom over the next two decades.Th 156-page report provid in-depth analysi of the vulner of countri and citi to job automation, explor what autom will mean for tradit model of econom growth, and consid how govern can prepar for the potenti disrupt impact of job autom on society.Key area of analysi in the new report includ thi startl project right at the outset:Risk of job autom in emerg economi such as China and India are as high as 77% and 69% over the next two decades.That' a lot of emerg market worker put out of work in a fairli short time.And it challeng what I had long believed: that China and India would make steadi progress in their effort to bring over 1 billion peopl collect into the rank of the global middl class.That assumpt wa base on the effici abil and desir of corpor to move manufactur and servic job to those countri and therebi balanc the global market for good and labor with the most cost-effici choic available.But the realiti is that autom trend -- broadli defin as those involv cloud computing, busi intellig (Big Data analytics), artifici intelligence, and robot -- will creat far more disrupt for capit and labor sourc than most are imagining.It' not just about the select compani go out of busi becaus a new technolog or softwar solut -- like 3-D ""printed"" part -- just replac what their 50 employe did for far less money. It' about entir industri get turn inside-out. In short, the industri revolut of China and India could be over sooner than mani would like.Here' how the Citi-Oxford report sum it up...""Whil manufactur product ha tradit enabl develop countri to close the gap with richer countries, autom is like to impact neg on their abil to do this, and new growth model will be required.""Th impact of autom may be more disrupt for develop countries, due to lower level of consum demand and limit social safeti nets. With autom and develop in 3D print like to drive compani to move manufactur closer to home, develop countri risk 'prematur de-industrialisation'.""Digit industri have not creat mani new jobs. Sinc 2000, just 0.5% of the US workforc ha shift into new technolog industries, most of which are directli associ with digit technologies.""Thi amount of disrupt should not be taken lightly. Massiv chang are come to industri that will have deep impact for economi and workers.I think everi citizen should be studi these chang and impact on an ongo basi to find the best way to posit their career, their business, and their investments.(end of excerpt from my June Zack Confidenti report)That report ended, as all ZC do, with action invest ideas.Task to answer the question ""How doe one invest to capit on these megatrends?"" I came up with 4 stock you had to own for the long term.Here' how I answered...So thi bring me back to my top 4 pick for the futur of work. And they will all be involv in robot and addit manufactur (3-D ""printing"") in some form, whether provid the softwar to design, build, and oper the machines, or the cloud-AI-machin learn data to drive their ""intelligence.""1)Microsoft (MSFT): I believ buy thi stock near $50 virtual guarante a chanc to beat the market over the next 5-10 years. Stifel Nicolau analyst recent met with Microsoft manag to talk about cloud and BI initiatives. Here' what they said: ""The meet serv to reinforc our view the company' commerci cloud strategi is on track to hit the $20B FY18 goal and should be a sourc of solid growth for the next sever years. Azur (the BigData platform) should also continu to close the gap with AW as Microsoft expand it product offer and is abl to exploit it exist custom relationship to creat uniqu hybrid scenarios."" They maintain a $58 12-month price target on MSFT shares.2)Alphabet (GOOGL): One of the most innov compani on the planet is also at the heart of Big Data analyt and automation. Thi is a stock that investor should view with a minimum 10-year horizon and dollar-cost averag small buy between $600 and $800, while you still can. While the compani will tri and fail at mani side ventures, ala the Skunk Work model they copi from Lockhe Martin innovators, Larri Page recent said hi new metric for evalu compani project is this: ""Are you work on someth that will chang the world? Ye or no?""3)Amazon (AMZN): Much like Page, Jeff Bezo ha a vision of the futur and find way to be a part of it. It' no wonder both of them are involv in space rocketri too. But Bezo is more practical, ensur steadi sales. He is credit with onc say someth to thi effect: ""Everybodi want to focu on how the futur will be different. We tri to ask 'How will it be the same?' and then those are the busi we want to be in.""4)IBM is relev and afford again near $150 (11X next year' $13.75 EPS). Their power Watson Cognit Analyt platform is appeal to mani industri at the enterpris level, from medic research and diagnost to manufactur and market predict capabilities. And they did a beauti thing by put a ""human"" voic on Watson to attract the interest and fascin of young peopl everywher in the power of data. It' their futur after all.I recommend IBM share in 2010 as the ""safe"" big cap Tech stock to outperform the market over 3 year and it did just that, rise from $125 to over $200 in 2013, with Warren Buffett join the parti at $175 as he final found a Tech stock he could love. My buy then wa base on their European contract in the ""smart energi grid"" which I believ carri lower risk than most busi sinc they were serving, and embed in, the infrastructur of municip power.IBM will find a way to ""embed"" Watson in the Busi Intellig and cognitive/predict analyt of mani corpor who will come to depend on their superior commit to data scienc R&D. Hopefully, they can use Watson to redesign the IBM corpor strategi for lower cost and higher sale and remain relev to investor for anoth 50 years.And here wa their perform from June 6 up to the election, and since:MSFT: +16.3% to the elect and +7.4% sinceGOOGL: +11.2% to the elect and +5.2% sinceAMZN: +8.4% to the elect and +7.96% sinceIBM: +1.6% to the elect and +15.65% sinceS&P 500: +12% from June 6 to March 9,2017It' nice to see that you would have done nearli as well own IBM as GOOGL or AMZN in thi full period sinc June 6. And noth ha chang in my view about ani of these stocks, although I would wait for pullback in all of them befor initi new positions. (I'v had a bet sinc the begin of the year with anoth investor about whether GOOGL or AMZN get to $1,000 first. They'v been trade neck-and-neck around $850 and my money is on the latter.)But I am ad 2 more stock to the mix. And, beyond fascinating, both of them have partner with IBM sinc my origin thesis.Th NVIDIA ConnectionI am go to tri and tell you thi import stori without mention those fanci action game my son play till all hours. I hearNVIDIA (NVDA)mak chip and graphic solut that satisfi a gamer' ""need for speed"" (and parallel processing) too. But thi stori will be about the technolog appli to more import tasks.In September, NVIDIA join forc with IBM to launch a new type of server built for machin learn base on NVIDIA' GPU semiconductor solutions. Thi is not a new partnership as the compani had been work togeth for sever year and you can get some background from thi 2014 NVIDIA blog post...NVIDIA and IBM Bring Supercomput to Big Data AnalyticsGPU-acceler comput is the use of a graphic process unit (GPU) togeth with a CPU to acceler deep learning, analytics, and engin applications. From the NVIDIA website, a crystal clear explanation...""A simpl way to understand the differ between a GPU and a CPU is to compar how they process tasks. A CPU consist of a few core optim for sequenti serial process while a GPU ha a massiv parallel architectur consist of thousand of smaller, more effici core design for handl multipl task simultaneously.""Mass Parallel Architectur (MPA)Yeah, that' what is need to do machin learn and anyth close to artifici intelligence.In the earli 1990' I read a book by physicist Heinz Pagel call The Dream of Reason: The Comput and the Rise of the Scienc of Complexity. Hi understand of how ""big data"" crunch would chang both scienc and busi wa power prescient nearli 30 year ago (publish in 1988).A chip innov shrunk comput power into ever smaller machines, amaz task suddenli becam afford to averag researchers, technologist and nerd in general. Heinz wasn't predict which compani would make money off of thi trend. But he knew it would have larg impact on society, science, and commerce.It wa in hi book that I first learn about ""parallel processing"" that make so much technolog possibl today. IBM ha been play with the ""massively"" compon for a while, ala Deep Blue, the world' top chess computer. NVIDIA ha taken it to new level sinc 2007. Together, they are a force.Her wa Ian Buck write on the NVIDIA blog on Septemb 8, 2016 about the new ventur with IBM...Data center workload are changing. Not long ago these system were primarili use to handl storag and serv up web pages, but now they'r increasingli task with AI workload like understand speech, text, imag and video or analyz big data for insights.Billion of consum want instant answer to a multitud of questions, while enterpris compani want to analyz mountain of data to better serv their customers' needs. Where do those answer come from? Data centers.A a leader in server systems, IBM saw thi trend come sever year ago, and partner with us to acceler new data center workloads. After four year of development, IBM today introduc it Power System S822LC for High Perform Comput power by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU and NVLink to facilit high-perform analyt and enabl deep learn on ever increas mountain of data.Th system coupl two of IBM' POWER8 CPU with four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU connect via our NVLink high-spe interface. Thi is a custom-built GPU acceler server, where the NVLink interfac is rout on the motherboard and use our Tesla P100 SXM2 GPU.Thi tight coupl of IBM and NVIDIA technolog enabl data to flow 5x faster than over PCIe, acceler time to insight for mani of today' most critic applications, like advanc analytics, deep learn and AI.""Th user insight and the busi valu you can deliv with advanc analytics, machin learn and artifici intellig is increasingli gate by performance,"" say Doug Balog, gener manag of IBM Power Systems. ""Acceler comput that can realli drive big data workload will becom foundat in the cognit era. Base on OpenPOW innov from partner such as NVIDIA, our new OpenPOW Linux server with POWERAccel set a new standard for these workloads.""And the two compani followed-up thi power coup against Intel' X86 line of core processor with thi news releas on Novemb 14...IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World' Fastest Deep Learn Enterpris SolutionMichael Feldman, write for the Top500.org, sum up the news thi way...""IT soul mate IBM and NVIDIA are at it again, thi time collabor on a deep learn (DL) toolkit, known as PowerAI, optim for IBM' Power S822LC for High Perform Comput platform. The integr of the toolkit and the IBM hardwar is be aim at what NVIDIA and IBM believ to be a burgeon market in enterpris AI.""GPU acceler now power energy-effici data center in govern labs, universities, enterprises, and small-and-medium busi around the world. They play a huge role in acceler applic in platform rang from artifici intellig to cars, drones, and robots.And the IBM-NVIDIA tag-team will be a power allianc in these comput markets.See? I did it. Got through that whole stori without mention that question use of time (""video games"") at all. Except just there.Th Salesforc ConnectionLast month, I wrote anoth Zack Confidenti about software. Thi one wa titl ""The SaaSi Natur of the Global Economy."" My thesi wa that softwar innov were often the best indic of trend in busi becaus after the game-chang smartphone, the explos of the app univers kept creat new categori of servic and entir new busi model (Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat, etc) that requir ever-furth innov in software.Mi top stock pick for that report wasSalesforce.com (CRM). Here' what I said...Th $57 billion giant of custom engag softwar is certainli not a takeov candid -- but then who thought LinkedIn wa either? In either case, CRM is still seen as the preemin leader in the industry, both by Wall Street analyst and research firm Gartner.Th stock is expens on a P/E basi but I expect innov in thi space to come from CRM at the expens of the competit as they ""stack"" featur and valu for their corpor clients. The averag price target on the Street is $93, while Goldman Sach bump their higher to $96 at the start of February.CRM report on Tuesday 2/28 and I would buy thi Zack #2 Rank on ani weak in the $70s.I bare mention the company' latest innovation, Einstein, becaus I didn't fulli understand it yet. It wa onli formal launch in late February.I also made a video where I briefli explain the high-level feud between CRM and MSFT, especi after LNKD:SaaSi B2B Sale Are in the Clouds.I bought CRM share last week for the Zack TAZR Trader servic after anoth strong earn report and guidanc on Februari 28. Two year ago, CEO Marc Benioff wa boast about have becom the fastest ""software"" compani to $6 billion in revenue, and set on becom the fastest to $10 billion.Given that 2016 close with $8.4 billion -- 26% annual growth -- and they are guid the current fiscal year to $10.2 billion (+21% annual growth), it seem they are on their way.Dur the company' Octob analyst day, Salesforc updat the size of it TAM (total address market) to about $70 billion in 2016 and project a CAGR of 11 percent to reach $105 billion by 2020. They have plenti of potenti to grab more of that market share.And while the valuat is a headwind for the stock -- trade at over 6X sale -- the premier posit in enterpris CRM is undisputed. If anybodi can grab more of that TAM, it' CRM.Embedded: Salesforc Know What It Mean TooFor the past few months, I'v been studi the sale softwar space and market ""enablement"" space via sever web-centr ""mini-CRMs"" like HubSpot (HUBS), Infusionsoft, Marketo, ReEnvis Inbound, and ActiveCampaign.Thes and other Saa platform are integr and autom the function of market and sale for small and medium-s busi like never before.Whil these young upstart potenti threaten CRM -- and Microsoft lead a beachhead assault with their buy-out of LinkedIn -- salesforce.com remain the ""killer app"" for mani corpor at the enterpris level.Part of the reason is, of course, that onc you have a custom relationship manag and engag platform ""embedded"" in your corporation' econom infrastructure, it' hard to ""kick them out of bed.""But anoth aspect is that Marc Benioff is still play to win -- especi after the MSFT-LNKD coup (see my videoSaaSi B2B Sale Are in the Cloudsfor the stori there).And so he keep innov and endear hi embed softwar to hi blue-chip enterpris clients. Here wa the latest headlin from Februari as they formal rolled-out the live version of the project they beta-launch in October...Salesforc Introduc Servic Cloud Einstein, the World' #1 Intellig Custom Servic PlatformBottom line: CRM remain top intel for ""salesforces"" everywhere.Einstein Ask Watson for HelpThen, thi week on March 6 came thi announc of a partnership...IBM and Salesforc today announc a global strateg partnership to deliv joint solut design to leverag artifici intellig and enabl compani to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before.

Stocks to Buy: 3 Tech Stocks Paying Nice Dividends,3/9/2017,"Mani of the bestdividend stocksar found in sector where the rate of chang and disrupt is slow -- sector like consum staples, utilities, and banks. But there are some excel dividend stock in the tech sector, too.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , for instance, all pay solid, grow dividends.Here' a look at whi each of these tech giant repres a good bet for investor look for income.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Apple: dividend upsideAppl offer the smallest dividend yield -- 1.6% -- of these three stocks. But investor shouldn't overlook it attractiveness. Apple' dividend easili make up what it lack in yield with growth potential.Currently, Appl is pay out just 27% of it earnings, leav signific upsid for dividend increas in the future. Further, manag ha demonstr how it' priorit dividend growth sinc the compani initi it dividend in 2012. Adjust for a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014, Apple' dividend ha increas 50% sinc 2012.Apple' annual dividend increas have steadili remain at about 10% -- a rate the compani look like it could sustain for year to come.IBM: an above-averag yieldWith a dividend yield of about 3.1%, IBM ha the fattest per-shar payout of these three stocks. Even more, while IBM' 44% payout ratio -- the percentag of annual earn it is pay out in dividend -- is well abov Apple' 27% payout ratio, it' still low enough for investor to expect meaning dividend growth for year to come.Indeed, IBM' dividend ha grown at a veri healthi averag annual rate of about 14% dure the past five years. However, the company' most recent dividend increas wasn't as substanti as in past years. In 2016, IBM' dividend increas 7.7%, down from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songo transformationha put pressur on net income.Despit the slowdown in IBM' dividend increases, the company' 21 consecut year of dividend increases, along with it low payout ratio, set a solid preced for ongo dividend increas over the long haul.Microsoft: endur cash flow from a profit busi modelMicrosoft' abil to gener headi level of cash flow from it profit busi model is undeniable. For the past 10 years, Microsoft' gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentag of revenue, ha been between about 61% and 81%. Sure, the softwar giant' gross profit margin is on the low end of thi rang today -- at 61%. But the inher profit of Microsoft' software-focus business, combin with the sticki of it Offic suit and it enterpris applic and services, mean it can count on endur cash flow for year to come, to continu feed investor solid dividends.Imag source: Getti Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offer investor a better dividend yield than Apple, but it' still well behind IBM' 3.1% dividend yield. While Microsoft' payout ratio of 69.5% is higher than IBM's, Microsoft' dividend as a percentag of free cash flow -- at 42% -- better captur the softwar giant' room for dividend increases. Recent one-tim charg against earn and restructur charg have suppress net incom and push the company' payout ratio higher. By comparison, Appl and IBM are pay out 23% and 41% of their free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft' most recent annual increas wa 8% -- and the company' financi look set to support similar increas over time.In general, incom investor may not find mani great dividend stock in tech. But these three stock are just as worthi of a spot in an incom portfolio as go-to Dividend Aristocrat in consum staples, utilities, and banking.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cavium Inc.'s Thunder X2 Aims for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud,3/9/2017,"Data center chipmakerCavium(NASDAQ: CAVM) announc on March 8 that it is ""collabor withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) on evalu and enabl a varieti of cloud workload run on [its] flagship Thunder X2 ARMv8-A Data Center processor for the Microsoft Azur cloud platform.""Th announc goe on to say that Cavium and Microsoft are ""demonstr web servic on a version of Window Server develop for Microsoft' intern use run cloud servic workload on Thunder X2.""Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Thi announc is similar to one that fellow ARM-bas server processor makerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)mad at the same time.Let' take a closer look at what thi announc mean for Cavium in the near term and potenti over the long term.Near term? Probabl not muchTh word of Cavium' press releas appear care construct to avoid give the impress that Microsoft is plan to buy and deploy a bunch of Cavium' Thunder X2 chip in it data center anytim soon.Indeed, the phrase ""evalu and enabling"" as well as the word ""demonstrating"" seem away away from ""plan to deploy in signific quantities.""So, in the near term, I don't expect the joint work that Microsoft and Cavium are do to lead to signific revenu for Cavium anytim soon. The work that these two compani are do is much more like to lay the groundwork for Microsoft to be abl to deploy potenti successor to the Thunder X2 -- should those product meet Microsoft' need for certain workloads.Tak a longer-term viewAt thi point, it' start to look as though Cavium and Qualcomm are the onli two merchant ARM-bas server processor vendor left in in the game (there are compani build chip for their own intern use like Huawei, for example).Cavium' edg appear to be it heritag is as a data center/network processor vendor (Qualcomm hail from a mobil processor background), but Qualcomm ha significantli greater financi resourc to tri to slug it out with market incumbentIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .It' like not go to be easi for either compani to wrest away signific market share from Intel to begin with (which invest more in data center-specif technolog and market than either Qualcomm or Cavium -- probabl more than both combined), and that difficulti is compound by the fact that Cavium and Qualcomm must compet against each other, too.Success for ARM server chip vendor like Qualcomm and Cavium is, in general, not someth that' guarante to come at all, and if it doe come, it'll be hard won over multipl year after substanti invest in research and development, software/ecosystem enablement, and market efforts.It' worth note that on Cavium' most recent earn call, CEO Sy Ali said that the compani ""expect[s] to releas [its] next gener products"" in 2017. Given that the compani had previous said that it would begin sampl Thunder X2 in the begin of 2017, I'd expect shipment for revenu to occur late in the year.What investor need to keep an eye on, then, is what kind of revenu ramp Cavium ultim begin to experi with Thunder X2 and the impact it start have on the company' financials, independ of thi announc from Microsoft.10 stock we like better than Cavium NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 at Its Own Game?,3/9/2017,"The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.Th import stock index consist of 500 of the largest compani that are list on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and secur are weight in the benchmark by market capit levels. Currently, top stock in the benchmark includ Appl (AAPL) at about 3.6% of the total, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.5% of the total, and Exxon Mobil (XOM) at 1.65%.But while thi approach is a great baromet for market health, is it the best way for investor to put their money to work? Investor have numer option in thi department, includ product likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simpli follow the benchmark exactli as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potenti better way?Ent Equal WeightIn thi edit ofth Dutram Report, I look for an altern approach in a talk with Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manag of INDEX Funds. Hi key product, the Index Fund S&P 500 Equal Weight (INDEX), take the same S&P 500 stocks, but invest in them equally.Thi mean that instead of Appl account for nearli 4% of the total, or Microsoft make up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughli 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalanc dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and everi stock come with thi same weight, give the fund an equal interest in giant like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 compon alike.Whil thi might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how thi actual end up be someth veri import to overal returns. Michael discuss how nearli half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tie up in about 50 companies, and that the remain 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argu that the equal weight is a much more balanc way to achiev exposure, while thefund' fact sheetshow that thi approach ha outperform the market over long time periods.W also talk about the pro and con of thi approach, such as it potenti heavier weight in mid-cap secur and what thi mean for investors, as well as some import fund specifics. Thi includ inform regard the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for select a fund structure. We then go over the way that INDEX differ from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), look beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compar to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqu weight invest is an overlook strategi for target stocks, but it is clearli one that can lead to outperform over long time periods. If you are curiou about thi approach, check out thi podcast for everyth you need to know about how it works, and if thi can help improv return for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to thi edit ofth Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pro and con of thi approach are for those seek a differ way to play the S&P 500.

It ha alway play up the secur of the iPhon and evenrefus an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneus by a shooter in 2015' San Bernardino terrorist attack.Appl CEO Tim Cook releas a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. govern ha ask us for someth we simpli do not have, and someth we consid too danger to create. They have ask us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""Th WikiLeak Vault 7 releas made it clear that iO wasn't as secur as Appl had thought.How Appl Could Come Out AheadWikiLeak is bad news for Appl in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hack of mobil devic and consum electron could actual be good news for the compani in the long run. Appl quickli went on record as say mani of the vulner identifi in the WikiLeak Vault 7 documentswer alreadi address with iO 10. And it is work to identifi and patch ani new issues.Appl and Googl chose veri differ strategi when it come to smartphones. Appl control everi aspect of iO - it mobil oper system - as well as the hardware. It push out new major new iO version yearli and updat releas (the kind that fix bug or secur issues) on demand. As a result,nearli 80% of all iPhon are current run iO 10.Googl also releas new version of Android yearly, but larg reli on smartphon manufactur and wireless carrier to approv and push updates. They have littl incent to do so, sinc lack the latest Android featur could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildli vari assort of smartphones, updat can often be problematic, lead to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajor are run softwar releas in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddress most of the issu in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundr of million of Android devic that could still be affectedbecaus they'r run old software. Most iPhon users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assur that Apple' consist program of releas will address ani outstand issues.Appl ha a similar approach with macOS. It updat it Mac comput oper system regularli and push out secur updat as issu are discovered. With the smart home,Appl take extrem secur measures, includ costli custom chips, factori inspect and end-to-end encrypt between connect devices. Thi approach ha meant slower adopt for it HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of be far more secur than the competition.A for smart TV eavesdrop on you, that' just anoth reason to buy a rel inexpens stream box - like an Appl TV - instead.Th Age of Privaci Is OverMani peopl had been live with a probabl naiv expect that everyth they did with their smartphon wa privat and secure, especi when use encrypt apps.

"AI Deep Dive: NVDA, IBM, CRM",3/9/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();Last June I wrote a special report forZack Confidentialcal ""Big Econom Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics.""Whil research and talk about science-fict technolog like machin learn and artifici intellig is alway fun, I began that report with a more import and sober premise: whi ten of million of job global were about to be elimin in the next decade.Thi assert came from research publish in Januari of 2016 by Citi and the Oxford Martin School explor the vari impact that autom would have on job and economi in major countri around the world.Here' what I wrote last June...Technolog at Work v2.0: The Futur Is Not What It Use to Be build on 2013 research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborn which found that 47 per cent of US job were at risk of autom over the next two decades.Th 156-page report provid in-depth analysi of the vulner of countri and citi to job automation, explor what autom will mean for tradit model of econom growth, and consid how govern can prepar for the potenti disrupt impact of job autom on society.Key area of analysi in the new report includ thi startl project right at the outset:Risk of job autom in emerg economi such as China and India are as high as 77% and 69% over the next two decades.That' a lot of emerg market worker put out of work in a fairli short time.And it challeng what I had long believed: that China and India would make steadi progress in their effort to bring over 1 billion peopl collect into the rank of the global middl class.That assumpt wa base on the effici abil and desir of corpor to move manufactur and servic job to those countri and therebi balanc the global market for good and labor with the most cost-effici choic available.But the realiti is that autom trend -- broadli defin as those involv cloud computing, busi intellig (Big Data analytics), artifici intelligence, and robot -- will creat far more disrupt for capit and labor sourc than most are imagining.It' not just about the select compani go out of busi becaus a new technolog or softwar solut -- like 3-D ""printed"" part -- just replac what their 50 employe did for far less money. It' about entir industri get turn inside-out. In short, the industri revolut of China and India could be over sooner than mani would like.Here' how the Citi-Oxford report sum it up...""Whil manufactur product ha tradit enabl develop countri to close the gap with richer countries, autom is like to impact neg on their abil to do this, and new growth model will be required.""Th impact of autom may be more disrupt for develop countries, due to lower level of consum demand and limit social safeti nets. With autom and develop in 3D print like to drive compani to move manufactur closer to home, develop countri risk 'prematur de-industrialisation'.""Digit industri have not creat mani new jobs. Sinc 2000, just 0.5% of the US workforc ha shift into new technolog industries, most of which are directli associ with digit technologies.""Thi amount of disrupt should not be taken lightly. Massiv chang are come to industri that will have deep impact for economi and workers.I think everi citizen should be studi these chang and impact on an ongo basi to find the best way to posit their career, their business, and their investments.(end of excerpt from my June Zack Confidenti report)That report ended, as all ZC do, with action invest ideas.Task to answer the question ""How doe one invest to capit on these megatrends?"" I came up with 4 stock you had to own for the long term.Here' how I answered...So thi bring me back to my top 4 pick for the futur of work. And they will all be involv in robot and addit manufactur (3-D ""printing"") in some form, whether provid the softwar to design, build, and oper the machines, or the cloud-AI-machin learn data to drive their ""intelligence.""1)Microsoft (MSFT): I believ buy thi stock near $50 virtual guarante a chanc to beat the market over the next 5-10 years. Stifel Nicolau analyst recent met with Microsoft manag to talk about cloud and BI initiatives. Here' what they said: ""The meet serv to reinforc our view the company' commerci cloud strategi is on track to hit the $20B FY18 goal and should be a sourc of solid growth for the next sever years. Azur (the BigData platform) should also continu to close the gap with AW as Microsoft expand it product offer and is abl to exploit it exist custom relationship to creat uniqu hybrid scenarios."" They maintain a $58 12-month price target on MSFT shares.2)Alphabet (GOOGL): One of the most innov compani on the planet is also at the heart of Big Data analyt and automation. Thi is a stock that investor should view with a minimum 10-year horizon and dollar-cost averag small buy between $600 and $800, while you still can. While the compani will tri and fail at mani side ventures, ala the Skunk Work model they copi from Lockhe Martin innovators, Larri Page recent said hi new metric for evalu compani project is this: ""Are you work on someth that will chang the world? Ye or no?""3)Amazon (AMZN): Much like Page, Jeff Bezo ha a vision of the futur and find way to be a part of it. It' no wonder both of them are involv in space rocketri too. But Bezo is more practical, ensur steadi sales. He is credit with onc say someth to thi effect: ""Everybodi want to focu on how the futur will be different. We tri to ask 'How will it be the same?' and then those are the busi we want to be in.""4)IBM is relev and afford again near $150 (11X next year' $13.75 EPS). Their power Watson Cognit Analyt platform is appeal to mani industri at the enterpris level, from medic research and diagnost to manufactur and market predict capabilities. And they did a beauti thing by put a ""human"" voic on Watson to attract the interest and fascin of young peopl everywher in the power of data. It' their futur after all.I recommend IBM share in 2010 as the ""safe"" big cap Tech stock to outperform the market over 3 year and it did just that, rise from $125 to over $200 in 2013, with Warren Buffett join the parti at $175 as he final found a Tech stock he could love. My buy then wa base on their European contract in the ""smart energi grid"" which I believ carri lower risk than most busi sinc they were serving, and embed in, the infrastructur of municip power.IBM will find a way to ""embed"" Watson in the Busi Intellig and cognitive/predict analyt of mani corpor who will come to depend on their superior commit to data scienc R&D. Hopefully, they can use Watson to redesign the IBM corpor strategi for lower cost and higher sale and remain relev to investor for anoth 50 years.And here wa their perform from June 6 up to the election, and since:MSFT: +16.3% to the elect and +7.4% sinceGOOGL: +11.2% to the elect and +5.2% sinceAMZN: +8.4% to the elect and +7.96% sinceIBM: +1.6% to the elect and +15.65% sinceS&P 500: +12% from June 6 to March 9,2017It' nice to see that you would have done nearli as well own IBM as GOOGL or AMZN in thi full period sinc June 6. And noth ha chang in my view about ani of these stocks, although I would wait for pullback in all of them befor initi new positions. (I'v had a bet sinc the begin of the year with anoth investor about whether GOOGL or AMZN get to $1,000 first. They'v been trade neck-and-neck around $850 and my money is on the latter.)But I am ad 2 more stock to the mix. And, beyond fascinating, both of them have partner with IBM sinc my origin thesis.Th NVIDIA ConnectionI am go to tri and tell you thi import stori without mention those fanci action game my son play till all hours. I hearNVIDIA (NVDA)mak chip and graphic solut that satisfi a gamer' ""need for speed"" (and parallel processing) too. But thi stori will be about the technolog appli to more import tasks.In September, NVIDIA join forc with IBM to launch a new type of server built for machin learn base on NVIDIA' GPU semiconductor solutions. Thi is not a new partnership as the compani had been work togeth for sever year and you can get some background from thi 2014 NVIDIA blog post...NVIDIA and IBM Bring Supercomput to Big Data AnalyticsGPU-acceler comput is the use of a graphic process unit (GPU) togeth with a CPU to acceler deep learning, analytics, and engin applications. From the NVIDIA website, a crystal clear explanation...""A simpl way to understand the differ between a GPU and a CPU is to compar how they process tasks. A CPU consist of a few core optim for sequenti serial process while a GPU ha a massiv parallel architectur consist of thousand of smaller, more effici core design for handl multipl task simultaneously.""Mass Parallel Architectur (MPA)Yeah, that' what is need to do machin learn and anyth close to artifici intelligence.In the earli 1990' I read a book by physicist Heinz Pagel call The Dream of Reason: The Comput and the Rise of the Scienc of Complexity. Hi understand of how ""big data"" crunch would chang both scienc and busi wa power prescient nearli 30 year ago (publish in 1988).A chip innov shrunk comput power into ever smaller machines, amaz task suddenli becam afford to averag researchers, technologist and nerd in general. Heinz wasn't predict which compani would make money off of thi trend. But he knew it would have larg impact on society, science, and commerce.It wa in hi book that I first learn about ""parallel processing"" that make so much technolog possibl today. IBM ha been play with the ""massively"" compon for a while, ala Deep Blue, the world' top chess computer. NVIDIA ha taken it to new level sinc 2007. Together, they are a force.Her wa Ian Buck write on the NVIDIA blog on Septemb 8, 2016 about the new ventur with IBM...Data center workload are changing. Not long ago these system were primarili use to handl storag and serv up web pages, but now they'r increasingli task with AI workload like understand speech, text, imag and video or analyz big data for insights.Billion of consum want instant answer to a multitud of questions, while enterpris compani want to analyz mountain of data to better serv their customers' needs. Where do those answer come from? Data centers.A a leader in server systems, IBM saw thi trend come sever year ago, and partner with us to acceler new data center workloads. After four year of development, IBM today introduc it Power System S822LC for High Perform Comput power by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU and NVLink to facilit high-perform analyt and enabl deep learn on ever increas mountain of data.Th system coupl two of IBM' POWER8 CPU with four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU connect via our NVLink high-spe interface. Thi is a custom-built GPU acceler server, where the NVLink interfac is rout on the motherboard and use our Tesla P100 SXM2 GPU.Thi tight coupl of IBM and NVIDIA technolog enabl data to flow 5x faster than over PCIe, acceler time to insight for mani of today' most critic applications, like advanc analytics, deep learn and AI.""Th user insight and the busi valu you can deliv with advanc analytics, machin learn and artifici intellig is increasingli gate by performance,"" say Doug Balog, gener manag of IBM Power Systems. ""Acceler comput that can realli drive big data workload will becom foundat in the cognit era. Base on OpenPOW innov from partner such as NVIDIA, our new OpenPOW Linux server with POWERAccel set a new standard for these workloads.""And the two compani followed-up thi power coup against Intel' X86 line of core processor with thi news releas on Novemb 14...IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World' Fastest Deep Learn Enterpris SolutionMichael Feldman, write for the Top500.org, sum up the news thi way...""IT soul mate IBM and NVIDIA are at it again, thi time collabor on a deep learn (DL) toolkit, known as PowerAI, optim for IBM' Power S822LC for High Perform Comput platform. The integr of the toolkit and the IBM hardwar is be aim at what NVIDIA and IBM believ to be a burgeon market in enterpris AI.""GPU acceler now power energy-effici data center in govern labs, universities, enterprises, and small-and-medium busi around the world. They play a huge role in acceler applic in platform rang from artifici intellig to cars, drones, and robots.And the IBM-NVIDIA tag-team will be a power allianc in these comput markets.See? I did it. Got through that whole stori without mention that question use of time (""video games"") at all. Except just there.Th Salesforc ConnectionLast month, I wrote anoth Zack Confidenti about software. Thi one wa titl ""The SaaSi Natur of the Global Economy."" My thesi wa that softwar innov were often the best indic of trend in busi becaus after the game-chang smartphone, the explos of the app univers kept creat new categori of servic and entir new busi model (Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat, etc) that requir ever-furth innov in software.Mi top stock pick for that report wasSalesforce.com (CRM). Here' what I said...Th $57 billion giant of custom engag softwar is certainli not a takeov candid -- but then who thought LinkedIn wa either? In either case, CRM is still seen as the preemin leader in the industry, both by Wall Street analyst and research firm Gartner.Th stock is expens on a P/E basi but I expect innov in thi space to come from CRM at the expens of the competit as they ""stack"" featur and valu for their corpor clients. The averag price target on the Street is $93, while Goldman Sach bump their higher to $96 at the start of February.CRM report on Tuesday 2/28 and I would buy thi Zack #2 Rank on ani weak in the $70s.I bare mention the company' latest innovation, Einstein, becaus I didn't fulli understand it yet. It wa onli formal launch in late February.I also made a video where I briefli explain the high-level feud between CRM and MSFT, especi after LNKD:SaaSi B2B Sale Are in the Clouds.I bought CRM share last week for the Zack TAZR Trader servic after anoth strong earn report and guidanc on Februari 28. Two year ago, CEO Marc Benioff wa boast about have becom the fastest ""software"" compani to $6 billion in revenue, and set on becom the fastest to $10 billion.Given that 2016 close with $8.4 billion -- 26% annual growth -- and they are guid the current fiscal year to $10.2 billion (+21% annual growth), it seem they are on their way.Dur the company' Octob analyst day, Salesforc updat the size of it TAM (total address market) to about $70 billion in 2016 and project a CAGR of 11 percent to reach $105 billion by 2020. They have plenti of potenti to grab more of that market share.And while the valuat is a headwind for the stock -- trade at over 6X sale -- the premier posit in enterpris CRM is undisputed. If anybodi can grab more of that TAM, it' CRM.Embedded: Salesforc Know What It Mean TooFor the past few months, I'v been studi the sale softwar space and market ""enablement"" space via sever web-centr ""mini-CRMs"" like HubSpot (HUBS), Infusionsoft, Marketo, ReEnvis Inbound, and ActiveCampaign.Thes and other Saa platform are integr and autom the function of market and sale for small and medium-s busi like never before.Whil these young upstart potenti threaten CRM -- and Microsoft lead a beachhead assault with their buy-out of LinkedIn -- salesforce.com remain the ""killer app"" for mani corpor at the enterpris level.Part of the reason is, of course, that onc you have a custom relationship manag and engag platform ""embedded"" in your corporation' econom infrastructure, it' hard to ""kick them out of bed.""But anoth aspect is that Marc Benioff is still play to win -- especi after the MSFT-LNKD coup (see my videoSaaSi B2B Sale Are in the Cloudsfor the stori there).And so he keep innov and endear hi embed softwar to hi blue-chip enterpris clients. Here wa the latest headlin from Februari as they formal rolled-out the live version of the project they beta-launch in October...Salesforc Introduc Servic Cloud Einstein, the World' #1 Intellig Custom Servic PlatformBottom line: CRM remain top intel for ""salesforces"" everywhere.Einstein Ask Watson for HelpThen, thi week on March 6 came thi announc of a partnership...IBM and Salesforc today announc a global strateg partnership to deliv joint solut design to leverag artifici intellig and enabl compani to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before.

4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit,3/9/2017,"For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is one that can be bought and larg forgotten about, with the occasion checkup to make sure those dividend check aren't in danger. A few of the Fool' contributor have identifi four high-yielddividend stocksthat fit thi description. Here' whyMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM) ,ONEOK(NYSE: OKE) , andEnterpris Product Partners(NYSE: EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks.A solid tech dividendTim Green(Microsoft):B a technolog company, Microsoft is more suscept to disrupt than other dividend-pay stalwarts. But it' not a compani that investor need to worri too much about. Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft ha shed it imag as a tech dinosaur and aggress embrac cloud computing. Microsoft' stranglehold on the product softwar market remain intact, it cloud-comput platform is a strong No. 2 player, and innov like the HoloLen augment realiti headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next comput revolution.Imag source: Microsoft.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Microsoft' dividend, current yield about 2.4%, isn't all that high. But it' superior to that of the averag yield of stock in theS&P 500, which yield less than 2%. Microsoft produc an incred amount of free cash flow -- nearli $25 billion in fiscal 2016. Thi fuel not onli $11 billion in dividend payments, put the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16 billion of share buybacks. There' still plenti of room to grow the dividend go forward, even without much earn growth.Microsoft' cash-rich balanc sheet is anoth reason the stock is attract to dividend investor aim to buy and hold for mani years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the end of the latest quarter, provid a massiv cushion that can sustain the dividend even in the roughest econom conditions. While there are higher-yield stock available, Microsoft is a good option for long-term investors.Tak a basket approach to high yieldsBrian Feroldi(Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natur for income-focus investor to want to own stock that offer up higher yield than the market in general. However, pick the right high-yield stock can be tricky, sinc a massiv payout can sometim actual be a warn sign.On altern that is avail to all investor is to instead invest in an exchange-trad fund (ETF) that is focus on dividend stock with above-averag yields. If that sound like a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look.Thi passiv manag ETF own more than 400 stock that have higher yield than the market in general. It biggest hold are all name that investor are familiar with -- think Microsoft,ExxonMobil,Johnson & Johnson-- which also provid investor with an extra layer of stability.Th VYM current offer a dividend yield of 3%, which is more than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 averag yield. Better yet, thi fund' 10-year total return -- which account for the reinvest of dividend -- is neck and neck with the S&P 500.VYM Total Return Pricedata byYCharts.Despit all of it benefits, Vanguard onli charg a minuscul 0.08% expens ratio to access thi ETF. Thus, if you are after a high yield but don't want to pick individu stocks, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excel choic for you.Thi energi play is a naturalDan Caplinger(ONEOK):Th plung in energi price in 2015 hurt compani throughout the industry, and even midstream infrastructur play like ONEOK took big hit in their share prices. Yet after lose 70% of it share price, ONEOK ha surg in the past year, nearli tripl as investor have figur out that not all compani have the same exposur to crudeoil pricesa others.ONEOK ha an impress slate of infrastructur assets, help in the gather process of natur ga from the Permian Basin, Rocki Mountain, and Mid-Contin region of the U.S. and then processing, storing, and transport it to key market center in the energi industry. That busi reli more on product volum than on price, and although the produc that ONEOK work with transport more natur ga when price are favorable, the energi transport giant ha still been abl to produc solid result as oil andnatur ga priceshav rebounded.ONEOK current ha a yield of 4.5%, but that figur should go up when the compani complet it plan acquisit of itsONEOK Partners(NYSE: OKS) master limit partnership. Onc the MLP deal is complete, ONEOK expect to boost dividend by a fifth, which should help the yield even further. As long as energi price remain strong enough to induc it client to send natur ga through it infrastructur network, ONEOK will be in posit to keep deliv incom to it investors.A model of consistencyMatt DiLallo(Enterpris Product Partners): Pipelin giant Enterpris Product Partner ha an excel track record of pay investor an above-averag dividend. In fact, sinc go public in 1998, the compani ha rais it payout 59 times, includ in each of the past 50 quarters. These haven't been token increases, either, with it last payout repres a 5.1% rais over the prior year.

The cloud infrastructur market is booming, grow 49% last year to $38.1 billion, accord to market research Canalys. It' expect to jump anoth 46% thi year to $55.8 billion.

Yet, when it come to AW and cloud revenue, Amazon is do just that; Amazon start share AW financi in 2015. AW revenu wa $12.2 billion last year, translat into $3.1 billion in oper income.Microsoft onli disclos growth rate for Azur (up 93% last quarter), but lack a base number, that data point is less meaningful. We do know that total revenu in Microsoft' intellig cloud segment, which includ Azur among other offerings, wa $6.9 billion last quarter, result in $2.4 billion in oper income. Lack an offici figure, JPMorgan analyst estim Azur revenu for all of 2016 wa $2.7 billion, which would make AW nearli five time bigger.Googl includ Googl Cloud revenu within it Googl other revenu segment, which gener a hair over $10 billion in sale in 2016.

That' put yourself out there and give clariti to your point of view. It' someth I wish I could see in Washington, but that' a whole differ ballgame.With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easi one, but so is the cautiou approach.

Still, with it equiti valu at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock realli worth that much?Click to EnlargeKeep in mind that despit four consecut year of double-digit growth, the magnitud ha also declined. The first strike wa 39.5% in 2013, follow by perform of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.Microsoft Stock Is a Proven WinnerAdmittedly, that' not the direct the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is go to be a happi camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock start off the year fairli slowly. For example, it first quarter return are a rel pedestrian 8%.But at year' end, the averag return jump up to 30.7%, nearli four time higher. That also mean that those who are concern about thi year' slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.Th other attribut that is remark about Microsoft is it resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffer a neg Q1 perform ten times. But in four of those instances, share manag to claw back posit return for the year. That provid a lot of secur for those make strongli optimist call for Microsoft stock.Whil investor have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is give Nadella and compani a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with it long-term strategy, and the sign are encouraging. A prime exampl is Microsoft'shigh-profil acquisitionofLinkedIn.

Why FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Is a Terribly Good Speculation Pick,3/8/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsThere' a reason whi mani analyst are loath to cover technolog firm - they'r just too damn volatile. Magnifi that by three or four time for compani in burgeon industri like cybersecurity.FireEy Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) is a prime exampl of sound logic convinc you to go long, onli to wish you hadn't. Unless you'r the Wall Street equival of Tom Brady, you can't take the kind of hit FEY stock ha absorb and simpli get away with it.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)I mean, who doesn't love cybersecurity? Whether you'r talk about PC virus or possibl alter the presidenti election, cybersecur is a hot-button issue.Compani like FEY are on the forefront of thi ever-expand and dynam sector.Becaus of thi distinct dynamism, you'd figur that there' plenti of room for competitors. I doubt that cyber-crimin are alway go to use the same tricks. Thus, come to market first may not necessarili be the absolut advantag that it is for other industries.To confirm thi point, FireEy stock start off with great fanfare. Investor were initi enthus by it robust momentum. But quickly, FEY stock began to lose favor. Indeed, when you look at the organ topically, it ha never return a profit for the year. And no, I'm not go to includ their extrem shorten 2013 debut.When you look at analyst coverag overall, you'd be hard-press to find anybodi stick their neck out for FireEy stock. Jeff Reeves, execut editor of InvestorPlace, sum it up unambigu when hewrote, ""FEY Stock Ha Crash for Good."" Thi wa written in earli August of 2016. Sinc then, FEY ha lost nearli 25% in the markets.Cybersecur Is Big Enough for FEY StockSo is there ani hope for thi long-embattl company? At first, the fundament don't look so hot for FEY stock. As InvestorPlac writer and IPO Playbook editor Tom Taulli notes, FEYE' most recentearn reportwa terrible. More ominously, their guidanc for the first quarter is pedestrian, to say the least, and FireEy stock subsequ got pounded.8 Dividend Growth Stock Rais The BarCompetitively, FEY ha to go up against two tailwinds. Primarily, they were late to the game in term of cloud integration, so they have some catch-up to do. On the broader front, the compani face seriou pressur from industri leadersPalo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT).However, FEY stock also ha to watch out for old guard firm likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). They'v got the resourc to exercis their ""mid-lif crisis"" of break into new sectors.At the same time, we have to appreci the scale of the cybersecur landscape. Accord toSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) CEO Greg Clack, 39% of North American resid have beenimpact by cybercrimein 2016. In hi words, ""I think that' a veri big crisis."" Naturally, Mr. Clack is think specif of hi organization' solutions. But the realiti is that FEY ha a solid chanc of make up for lost ground.Furthermore, con artist are constantli get creativ with theirnefari activities. Mani of these are expos by govern watchdogs, but by that point, the con is long gone. You can onli imagin the possibl with cybercrime. So yes, FEY stock look absolut terribl now, I'll concede. But due to the evolv natur of cybercrime, it' riski to assum that FireEy stock will forev be a dud.Th Worst for FireEy Stock Is Behind ItBas on the action of investors, I think the compani is in the earli stage of a turnaround. Long-term, the magnitud of volatil in FEY stock is slow significantly.Click to EnlargeFor example, in 2016, the averag close price for FireEy stock wa $15.19. That' nearli a 60% loss from the prior year averag of $37.64. But so far thi year, FEY stock averag $12.22, which is a more modest loss from last year of 19.6%.Anoth interest point is that share could have fallen much further than it did. Everyon agre that 2016 wa a choppi period for FEYE, yet the lowest close price last year wa $11.01.Whi Boe Co (BA) Stock Will Hit Turbul in 2017Presently, the averag close is 11% higher than thi figure. Also, it present market valu is onli a few cent shi of 2016' close low. That' not a great statistic, I know. But it leav the impress that the worst of the volatil may be over.Mi final contrarian argument is that we'r not deal with a fly-by-night operation. FEY CEO Kevin Mandia wa a former U.S. Air Forc intellig officer, and is wide consid a cybersecur expert. Thi is not someon that is go to jeopard hi reput on a whim. I'd also give FireEy stock a higher chanc of success base on thi much-needed, highli demand industry.Ultimately, I understand the hesit of FEY stock. It ha simpli lost too much valu to be term a stabl investment. But for those with some risk capit to play with, FireEy stock is a compel bet. The market loss are be pared, and you have substanti intellectu firepow on the execut team.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump Now7 Stock to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buy RangeTh postWhi FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock Is a Terribl Good Specul Pickappear first onInvestorPlace."
"Retirees, Maximize Your Income From Dividends",3/8/2017,"Dividend invest is suppos to be a bit like watch grass grow: steadi progress, few surprises. But lately, investor hold dividend-pay stock have suffer some jar setbacks.SE ALSO:8 Great Dividend Stock for RetireesHigher-yield sector such as util and real estat invest trust saw valuat soar through much of 2016, then suffer sharp pullback later in the year. Analyst see more pain ahead for high-dividend-yield stock as interest rate start to rise, divert income-focus investor from stock into bonds. A stretch of stagnant earn growth, meanwhile, put the brake on the double-digit dividend growth that investor have grown accustom to sinc the financi crisis. Standard & Poor' 500-stock index dividend climb just 5% in 2016.""It' realist to start think that the best might be over in term of dividend growth,"" say Christin Benz, director of person financ at investment-research firmMorningstar.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Do thi mean older investor should scale back dividend holdings? Hardly. The idea of get incom from stock still ""make a lot of sense, particularli in thi low-rat world,"" say Toni DeSpirito, co-manag ofBlackRock Equiti Dividend fund. At roughli 2.5%, the yield on theRussel 1000 Valu Indexi about the same as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, he notes. But while the Treasuri bond offer a fix coupon, stock offer potenti dividend growth and share-pric appreciation.Th challeng is to pick the rightdividend stocksor funds. Round up the usual suspects--high dividend-yield utilities, REITs, consum stapl and telecom stocks--may not be the best approach. One reason: You'd be ignor some of the biggest dividend-pay sectors, includ technolog and financials.Th higher-yield stock also look expensive, even after their late-2016 sell-off, money manag say. Investor have use them as bond substitut in a low-rat era, and as rate rise, these bond proxi will suffer more than lower dividend-yielders.Stock that can deliv steadi dividend growth, rather than the richest yields, offer the most fertil ground for dividend investors. These hold look cheaper than the high-yielders, they can hold up well in a rising-r environment, and they can offer a buffer against market volatility.Y can maxim the incom you get from these hold by minim fee and taxes. In a dividend-focus mutual fund, a lofti expens ratio can chew through most of your yield. And although the 15% tax rate paid by most investor on qualifi dividend seem rel benign, mani hold favor by dividend investor and dividend fund don't get thi treatment. Most REIT payouts, for example, are tax as ordinari income.Follow these tip to build a dividend portfolio that can deliv reliabl incom despit rise rate and slow dividend growth--so you can get back to watch the grass grow.Go for GrowthReli dividend grower have prove resili dure the roughest time in the market. In a recent study, S&P Dow Jone Indic compar the perform of dividend ""aristocrats""--S&P Composit 1500 stock that have rais their dividend everi year for at least 20 years--against high-yield stock in the S&P 500. Dure the 15 worst month for the broader stock market from the end of 1999 through Septemb 2016, the aristocrat lost 5.9%, on average, versu an 8.6% loss for the high-yield and an 8.9% averag declin for the S&P 1500.Thearistocrat tend to be more resilientdur the worst market downturn in part becaus rais dividend year after year reflect a certain level of financi health and discipline, S&P notes.So where can you find depend dividend grower at a decent price? For old-school dividend investor rais on Ma Bell and Coca-Cola, the answer may be a bit surprising.On sector that' highli favor by value-mind dividend fund manag these days: technology. In 2016, the sector surpass financi to becom the biggest contributor to S&P 500 dividends, account for 15.5% of payouts.SE ALSO:25 Dividend Stock You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMatur tech companies, such as Microsoft (symbolMSFT; recent price, $64), Cisco System (CSCO, $32) and Qualcomm (QCOM, $54), gener load of free cash flow and are find fewer opportun to re-invest in their businesses, say Mike Liss, co-manag of theAmerican Centuri Valu fund. That leav them with an ""abil to increas their dividend at a rate better than the averag stock,"" Liss says.Microsoft, which yield 2.3%, ha nearli doubl it quarterli dividend in the past five years, to 39 cent a share. Money manag see more healthi dividend growth ahead as the company' leadership in cloud comput improv it earnings-growth prospects.Cisco, which yield 3.3%, is known for make the switch and router that move data around comput networks. But Cisco is also expand into faster-grow area such as collabor and security. The compani ha boost it dividend everi year sinc initi it payout in 2011.Patient investor should also take a look at Qualcomm, which yield 3.8%, say John Buckingham, chief invest offic atAFAM Capitaland manag of theAl Frank fund. The stock ha been crush thi year, in part becaus Appl is su Qualcomm over it busi practices, and it now trade at just 11 time analysts' estim of earn in the come year. Buckingham believ the litig will ultim be settl and ""the magnitud of the declin ha creat opportun for those who can take a long-term view.""Look for Healthi PayoutsHealth care stock have look rather sickli lately. Concern about repeal of the Afford Care Act, as well as talk from Washington about negoti lower drug prices, have weigh on the sector.But the polit nois ha creat an opportun for long-term dividend investors, particularli in drug stocks. ""If you continu to creat drug that are innov and meet unmet needs, you'r go to get premium price for those products,"" Liss says.Hold in Liss' fund includ drug giant Pfizer (PFE, $32) and Merck (MRK, $64). Pfizer yield 3.8% and trade at just 13 time analysts' estim of it full-year earnings. While the loss of patent protect on sever drug is a headwind, the compani maintain an impress portfolio of patent-protect drug and is launch sever potenti best-sel in cancer, immunolog and other areas.Lik Pfizer, Merck ha a strong pipelin of new drug to balanc out upcom patent losses. Cancer drug Keytruda ha been a notabl success as the compani sharpen it focu on unmet medic needs. Merck yield 2.9% and ha rais it dividend six year in a row.Swiss drug giant Roch Hold (RHHBY, $30) and Novarti (NVS, $75) also look like good values, say Matt Burdett, associ portfolio manag atThornburg Invest Management. Pricey biologics, which tend to have less gener competition, account for a larg portion of Roche' drug sales, and Roch also ha a strong diagnost business. The stock yield 3.4%.Novartis, which yield 3.6%, is well diversifi with pharmaceuticals, eye care and other businesses. The compani is launch sever drug in key area such as cancer and heart failure.Guard Against Rise RatesRis rate gener aren't disastr for dividend stocks. Look at the two-, three- and five-year period follow the initi of Feder Reserv rate-hik cycl date back to 1954, dividend payer have outperform non-dividend payers, accord to AFAM Capital.But when interest rate rise, some dividend payer do suffer. In recent research, Morningstar look at rising-r period from May 1953 through the end of 2016. The 30% of stock with the highest yield lost about 1.5%, on average, while the 30% with the lowest yield gain 3.2%.SEE ALSO:8 Dow Dividend Stock You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMani dividend-focus fund manag are favor a sector that stand to benefit from rise rates: financials. As rate rise, bank may see an improv in their net interest margins--a measur of lend profitability. What' more, bank are like to see looser capit requir and other deregul under the new administration, say Sandi Pomeroy, co-manag of theNeuberg Berman Equiti Incom fund. With capit freed up, bank may have more flexibl to boost their dividends.Mani big bank stock saw sharp run-up after the election. One that still look attract valu is Bank of America (BAC, $23), say Matt Quinlan, co-manag of theFranklin Incom fund. At 1.1%, it doesn't have the richest yield, but it trade for less than book value. The bank ha slowli recov from it ill-advis 2008 acquisit of mortgag lender Countrywid Financi and ha sharpli cut cost in recent years.Ris rate are also ""a posit for insur compani who have substanti dollar in fix income,"" Buckingham says. He like MetLif (MET, $53), which yield 3% and trade at just 10 time analysts' estim of it full-year earnings. The compani is spin off a U.S. retail unit, a move that analyst see as help MetLif gener more stabl cash flow.Focu on FundsIf you'r shop for a dividend-focus mutual fund, keep a close eye on fees. A mutual fund' expens ratio eat into it yield. So ""the relationship between expens ratio and incom is quit direct,"" Benz says.On high-quality, low-cost fund is Vanguard Dividend Appreci (VIG), an exchange-trad fund that yield 2.1% and charg just 0.09% annually. It track the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achiev Select Index, which includ compani that have boost dividend for at least 10 consecut years.Anoth low-cost option: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equiti ETF (SCHD). The fund track the Dow Jone U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includ compani that not onli have paid dividend for 10 year in a row but also have strong cash-flow-to-debt ratios, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. The fund yield 2.9% and charg just 0.07% annually.Investor look to avoid the highest yielder might also consid iShar Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO). It track the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index, which exclud stock with yield in the top 10% of the broader stock universe. The fund charg 0.08% annual and yield 2.3%.Whether you'r choos a dividend-focus fund or pick your own stocks, pay attent to the potenti tax hit. Qualifi dividends, which includ most U.S. stock dividends, get favor tax treatment. Taxpay in the 25% to 35% tax bracket pay 15% on qualifi dividends. Taxpay in the 10% and 15% bracket pay zero; those abov the 35% bracket pay 20%. If your adjust gross incom is more than $200,000 for singl or $250,000 for marri couples, you'll owe an addit 3.8% on your net invest income, includ qualifi dividends.But mani hold favor by dividend investor don't pay qualifi dividends. Payout from REITs, some foreign stock and convert can be tax as ordinari income. With master limit partnerships, a larg chunk of distribut is typic tax-deferred, but investor may pay a combin of capital-gain and ordinary-incom tax rate when they sell their units.""It' worth look under the hood"" of dividend-focus fund becaus mani of these fund hold non-qualifi dividend payers, Benz says. She point toAmerican Centuri Equiti Income, which is a high-qual fund but tend to hold some non-qualifi dividend payer such as convertibles. The fund' 10-year tax-cost ratio is 1.8, accord to Morningstar, mean that investor have lost an averag annual 1.8% of asset to taxes. Investor inVanguard Dividend Appreci Index fund, which hold onli common stocks, have sacrif far less to taxes, lose an averag annual 0.73% over the period.Anoth tax question for dividend investor is whether to hold foreign dividend-pay stocks--or fund that invest in those stocks--in an IRA. Mani countri withhold tax from dividend that their compani pay to oversea investors. U.S. investor are tax a second time on those dividends, either when they report dividend incom for their taxabl account or withdraw money from their IRA. You can claim a foreign tax credit on your feder return for the tax withheld by the foreign country--but onli if you hold the stock in a taxabl account. If you hold the invest in an IRA, there' no way to recoup the foreign tax paid.""If you have an IRA and a taxabl account, put the foreign stock or foreign stock fund into the taxabl account,"" say John Burke, a financi advis atBurk Financi Strategies, in Iselin, N.J. But there' a caveat: Compani in countri that don't have a tax treati with the U.S. may pay non-qualifi dividends, make them a poor fit for a taxabl account. Most countri have a tax treati with the U.S., but there are signific except such as Brazil, Chile and Singapore.TAK OUR QUIZ:Test Your Invest IQ"

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloud,3/7/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) founder and Execut Chairman Jack Ma ha a lot of iron in the fire; nowher is that truer than in hi fight to take onAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the global race for enterpris cloud comput dominance. Right now, it' not even close - Amazon is lead by a countri mile, but BABA is quickli close the gap between the two and that' a good thing if you own Alibaba stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazonenteredth cloud comput busi in 2006. Amazon Web Servic (AWS) now gener more than $3.1 billion in oper incom (fiscal 2016) from $12.2 billion in revenue, a juici oper margin of 25.4%.Thi wa consider higher than the $1.1 billion it gener from $123.8 billion (0.90% oper margin) in revenu from it e-commerc and Amazon Prime membership fees.It' easi to understand whi BABA want in on Amazon' action - there' lot of money to be made from the cloud.What' Go on With Alibaba Stock and the Cloud?In Q3 2016, Alibaba went over the $1 billion annual run rate in cloud comput revenu gener $254 million from 765,000 pay customers, up 115% and 100% year-over-year respectively. Most importantly, it cloud comput busi had an oper loss of just $49 million, 18.3% less than it Q2 2016 oper loss of$60 million.That' great news for Alibaba stock becaus at thi rate, it should be in the black by sometim in fiscal 2017 and that will add to the alreadi signific oper profit it gener from it core e-commerc busi -$4 billionin the third quarter alone, a mouth-wat oper margin of 59.7%.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017Put anoth way, BABA' cloud comput segment along with it other money-los busi lost $976 million in the third quarter on revenu of $961 million; essentially, it lost a dollar for everi dollar of revenue.That' insane.Alibaba generated$5.5 billionin oper profit through the first nine month of fiscal 2016 despit loss in other area total $2.8 billion. Amazon gener $4.2 billion in oper incom from more than 10 time the revenue.Ther are mani reason whi you might want to own Amazon' stock (Jeff Bezosi a big one) but consid how valuabl BABA stock would be were it cloud comput busi gener oper profit margin similar to AWS.Alibaba' cloud comput busi would go from an annual loss of $225 million ($169 million oper loss in Q3 2016 on an annual basis) on $1 billion in revenu to an oper profit of $250 million on the same revenue, a $475 million difference.""Our goal is to overtak Amazon in four years, whether that' in customers, technology, or worldwid scale,"" Simon Hu, the head of Alibaba' cloud businesstoldReutersin 2015. ""Amazon, Microsoft and other have alreadi laid the groundwork for us by educ the market about cloud in the U.S. and Europe, so we have an even better opportun to join in the competition.""Estim put the global cloud comput busi at $20 billion. However, given Amazon' AW revenu in 2016 wa $12.2 billion,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is come on in thi area and thought to be in thesecondspot behind AMZN and Alibaba' annual run rate is over $1 billion, the number is like much higher.Whi Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Could Have More Problem Than You ThinkAccord to TechCrunch, Synergi Research Group analyst John Dinsdal reveal that ""For cloud infrastructur servic (IaaS, PaaS, Host Privat Cloud services) Alibaba is now rank sixth, base on worldwid revenu in Q4. For China specifically, while AW and Microsoft are in the top five rank in China, the market is led by Alibaba (a long way out in front) follow by China Telecom. Alibaba market share is run at 40 percent [in China] and ha been increas with time.""Bottom Line on BABA StockInterestingly, the fact that BABA stock wa late to the cloud comput party, might actual work in it favor becaus larg compani are far more open to work in the cloud these day than they were a decad ago when Amazon got in the business.Therefore, you could argu that the company' invest in the cloud, albeit sever billion dollars, is still far less riski than Amazon' initi move back in 2006.While there are mani tentacl to the Alibaba stock, cloud comput is one that will continu to reap dividend for BABA stock in the year to come.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Telecom Stock That Are High-Yield Money Traps5 Blue-Chip Stock to Buy in MarchTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloudappear first onInvestorPlace."

"6 Things You Didn't Know About Baidu, Inc.",3/6/2017,"Mani tech investor are probabl familiar with the basic fact aboutBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) -- it' the biggest search engin in China, it ha a grow ecosystem of cloud-bas servic likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it benefit greatli from Google' exit from the mainland Chines market in 2010.Those are the bullet point in the growth stori that boost Baidu stock by nearli 1,500% over the past decade. But today, we'll take a look at six lesser-known fact about the ""Chines Google"" which mani investor might have overlooked.Imag source: Author' screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. CEO Robin Li cut hi teeth in the U.S. tech industryAft earn a master' degre in Comput Scienc from the Univers of Buffalo, Baidu co-found and CEO Robin Li work at Dow Jone & Co.' IDD Inform Servic and search compani Infoseek in the 1990s.At IDD, Li develop the softwar for the onlin version ofTh Wall Street Journaland invent hi patent Rankdex site-scor algorithm for SEO rank -- which current power Baidu' search engine. At Infoseek, Li creat the imag search function, which wa subsequ use inDisney' Go.com network. After spend over five year at those two companies, Li return to China and co-found Baidu with investor Eric Xu in earli 2000.2. Baidu is develop driverless carsLik Google, Baidu believ that autonom electr car would be a natur extens of it data mine ecosystem. The compani start test out driverless car on public road in late 2015, and form a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley last April.Imag source: Getti Images.Baidu is power these vehicl with a combin ofNVIDIA' automot chips, HERE Maps, and it own AI algorithms. It' current outsourc product of these vehicl to Chines automakers, and ha declar that it will launch an autonom shuttl bu by 2018.3. It' beef up it AI effortsFor search engin like Baidu and Google, AI play a key role in recogn images, analyz search patterns, and decid what type of target ad will appeal to users. That' whi Baidu hire a lot of top talent in AI -- it chief scientist Andrew Ng previous helm the Googl Brain AI project, and it new augment realiti chief Qi Lu wa previous an AI specialist atMicrosoft.Baidu hasn't been shi about challeng Googl in the AI arm race. In January, it pit it AI program against Google' AlphaGo AI in a seri of facial and voic recognit test in a live TV broadcast.4. Baidu own a small stake in Didi ChuxingBaidu previous invest in Uber' Chines division, but Uber eventu retreat from the market due to tough competit -- especi from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold it Chines busi to Didi last August, but retain a 17.7% stake in the new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China' other sharehold receiv a 2.3% stake.That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightli integr Didi' servic into it O2O (online-to-offline) ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in autom Baidu' driverless cars.5. It own a big part of CtripBaidu own a 25% stake inCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , the largest onlin travel agenc (OTA) in China. For years, Ctrip wa engag in a price war with it primari competitorQunar(NASDAQ: QUNR) , which crush both companies' margins.Baidu own a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swap that stake for a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effect merg the two compani and end the price war. That move also tether Ctrip' servic more tightli to Baidu' grow O2O ecosystem.6. Baidu also sell smart bikesIn late 2014, Baidu introduc DuBike, a bike equip with a wide array of health and motion sensor which sync to a mobil app. It also featur on-board navig signals, which let rider follow direct without glanc at their phones, and let rider share their rout with friends. To top it off, the entir system is power by a rider' kinet energi -- so the bike never need to be recharged.Baidu' DuBike. Imag source: Baidu.Th key takeawayTh heart of Baidu' busi is still search-bas advertising, but that could gradual chang as it effort in driverless cars, AI, it O2O ecosystem, and even smart bike pay off. Therefore, investor should keep an eye on these adjac effort as the compani trade blow with other tech titan -- likeTencentandAlibaba-- over the next few years.10 stock we like better than BaiduWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",3/6/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh collaps ofBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) ha been stunning. But in the tech world, such thing do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRi stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it' amaz that the compani ha been abl to recov from have to deal with the onslaught of mega oper likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let' face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up success fight. Thi wa certainli a major reason whi CEO Steve Ballmer step aside.But surviv is not enough, of course. So it should be no surpris that - for the past five year - BBRi stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, thi wa the sentiment for say,Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stock That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gaug the potenti opportun of BlackBerri stock, let' take a look at three pro and cons:3 Pro On BBRi StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which wa struggl againstOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructur the oper and redirect the compani toward enterpris mobil and commerce. He would ultim sell Sybas toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefti $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also ha strongtechn chops. Consid that he ha a master' in electr engin from California Institut of Technology. He also got hi first job as an engin withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transit a compani from hardwar to softwar is no easi feat. But Chen ha definit made lot of progress with thi strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenu from Softwar & Servic came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% wa recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterpris custom order in the quarter.For Chen, he ha made some savvi acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And anoth import part of the strategi ha been to outsourc phone development. Thi ha meant fewer distract as well as the opportun to pick-up high-margin licens revenues.Someth else: Chen ha done a good job in leverag some of the long-tim core technolog assets. An exampl of thi is BlackBerri Secure, which is a full-blown suit of mobil enterpris apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRi is tri to posit itself to get a share of the embed technolog market, which is see tremend growth from the auto sector. Note that the compani ha BlackBerri QNX, which is a softwar develop platform that provid top-notch secur featur and ha been award the ISO 26262 ASIL D certif for cars. The system is optim to support lead vendor likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.A a testament to the advantag of QNX, BBRi recent sign an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Con On BBRi StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRi wa the global leader in the fast-grow smartphon market. But the iPhon would quickli end thi dominance. What' more, BBRi made plenti of blunders, such as in term of aw launches.Th result is that the BlackBerri brand is fairli tarnished. Granted, thi mani not seem to matter as much sinc the compani ha move away from the consum market. However, the brand could still be a problem with busi custom as well. Whi use technolog from a compani that seem to have a dicey future?Competition: It' intense. When it come to the secur market, there are mani player that have great offer likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Softwar Technolog Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterpris mobil solut also ha mani tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY' offer in the messag categori also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT' Skype, AAPL' iMessag and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRi seem to be good buyout bait. The company' cost structur ha been streamlined, there are strong technolog asset and a larg custom base.Yet Accord toInvestorPlace.com' Richard Saintvilus: ""It ha becom clear that Chen - who wa brought in to build BlackBerri into an M&A target - ha taken thi compani as far as he can take it. Despit all of the boast the compani ha done about it superior secur capabilities, BBRi stock ha had no M&A suitors, suggest compani likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracl Corpor and other enterprise-focus compani with which BlackBerri ha often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRi StockAgain, Chen ha done a great job. Let' face it, BBRi wa a complet mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsH wast littl time with cost cut and outsourc of the phone business. More importantly, he ha invest in area like security, embed system and even the Internet of Thing (IoT).However, despit all this, the fact remain that progress ha been grudging. If anything, it will probabl still take some time - say a year or so - for the chang to have a real impact. In other words, for those look at BBRi stock, it' probabl best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

The fintech industri is now more than just about payments. It is stretch it wing to credit, the stock market and tradit bank institutions.

"Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Microsoft",3/6/2017,"They'r two of the five largest publicli trade compani in the world. They'r technolog giant that are increasingli compet against one anoth in multibillion-dollar growth industri such as cloud comput and artifici intelligence. They'reAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .And they'r vastli differ compani in term of their core oper focuses, their recent histories, and their cultures. So which is the better buy today? Let' examin Amazon.com and Microsoft through three analyt lenses, to determin which tech stalwart repres the better stock to buy today.Financi fortitudeThough both compani are financi behemoths, Microsoft beat Amazon in thi comparison of financi fortitude. Here' a quick summari of sever import liquid and solvenc measur for each company.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioMicrosoft$122.7 billion$84.9 billion$36.7 billion2.1Amazon.com$25.9 billion$7.7 billion$16.4 billion1.0Data sources: Amazon.com and Microsoft investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.Microsoft and Amazon are in fine financi shape. However, even though Microsoft carri more debt than Amazon, it earn a win in thi categori by beat the world' largest e-commerc provid in three categories. Plus, onli $600 million of Microsoft' borrow will come due thi calendar year. The overwhelm major of Microsoft' debt come due after 2020, and then at veri low interest rates. Given the company' cash flow gener capabilities, servic that debt should be no issu for Microsoft.It also bear note that Microsoft, likeApple, keep the bulk of it cash hold oversea to shield it from repatri taxes. In it most recent 10-Q, the compani didn't disclos how much cash lie offshore, but it annual 10-K file show that it kept approxim 96% overseas. But sinc it gener plenti of oper cash flow to fund it domest and intern operations, thi is realli a non-issu for investors.Winner: Microsoft.Dur competit advantagesMicrosoft and Amazon.com each enjoy competit advantages, albeit of differ sorts. Amazon' primari moat are it scale and risk-tak culture. At thi point, Microsoft' competit insul seem more structur and historic. Let' unpack each of those a bit more.Amazon gener the bulk of it sale from it core e-commerc operations, account for 91% of revenu in 2016. As the world' largest e-commerc site by revenue, Amazon ha an incred scale that allow it to consist offer low prices. More impress still, Amazon' uniqu abil to turn it own platform into sourc of revenu -- think Amazon Web Services,Fulfil by Amazon, third-parti ad on Amazon.com, and so on -- allow it to charg the lowest price possibl on it e-commerc site, which in turn attract more customers. Thi self-regener busi philosophi is best summar in the idea of theFlywheel Effect, which is at the core of Amazon' strategi and touch on it uniqu culture.Imag Source: Amazon.comTo creat a cultur that could invent profit center to buoy it low- or even negative-margin e-commerc sales, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo and hi team need to creat a cultur where risk-tak and unconvent think were the norm. Bezo summar risk-taking' foundat place in Amazon' cultur in the 2015 annual letter:A word about corpor cultures: For better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change. ... One area where I think we are especi distinct is failure. I believ we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenti of practice!), and failur and invent are insepar twins.Without it uniqu corpor mindset, Amazon never would have had the audaci and vision to launch mani of it most import initiatives, make it cultur arguabl it most import asset and sourc of endur competit advantage.Microsoft' sourc of competit advantage, on the other hand, can be summar in one word: ""Office."" It remain Microsoft' financi heart and soul and is the largest revenu sourc at the company, singlehandedli account for $23.5 billion, or 27%, of Microsoft' $85.3 billion in sale in fiscal 2016.CEO Satya Nadella' 2015-16 reorgan of Microsoft' oper creat three new report segments: product and busi process (PBP), intellig cloud, and more person computing. PBP hous the consum and commerci Offic operations, as well as Microsoft' Dynam CRM platform. The entir segment gener $26.5 billion of Microsoft' total sales, so we know, use the Offic revenu figure, that Offic drive the segment' performance.It import come into greater focu when look at Microsoft' operating-profit breakdown. PBP -- again, mostli Offic -- gener $12.4 billion, or 62%, of Microsoft' $20.1 billion in fiscal 2016 oper income, make it the financi bellweth that guid Microsoft' financi performance.Oth segments, particularli Intellig Cloud, have becom increasingli import piec of Microsoft' financi footprint as well. However, Microsoft' core competit advantag still lie in the fact that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint make up the default product softwar for the major of world' computer-us population, and that' a sourc of tremend advantag -- and profit -- for the company.Winner: Tie.ValuationCompar the valuat of Microsoft and Amazon isn't the simplest exercise, given their differ growth profiles. With that in mind, here are three of the most commonli use valuat metric for each company.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAMicrosoft30.219.716.8Amazon.com173.766.134.1EV = ENTERPRIS VALUE. EBITDA = EARN BEFOR INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Her we get a great comparison of two invest style -- growth versu value. Neither come out ahead here. More conserv investor who prefer to own stock with someth of a margin of safeti will probabl be drawn to Microsoft, with it more conserv valuat and 2.3% dividend yield. Of course, those same investor have alway argu that Amazon is overvalued, even as the company' stock ascend ever higher.From the perspect of a long-term investor, I believ Amazon' abil to grow at above-averag rate for years, if not decad to come, will enabl it to grow into and beyond it current valuation. Microsoft' main issue, meanwhile, remain it growth outlook.Thi analysi is somewhat subjective. More risk-avers investors, particularli those near retirement, might want to stay away from Amazon stock. However, for those with the abil to buy and hold a compani for a decad or more, I like Amazon despit it aggress valuat today.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... Amazon, by a noseBoth Amazon and Microsoft offer investor attract invest opportunities, in veri differ ways. As I mentioned, Microsoft is probabl a better option for more risk-avers investors. It' a stable, matur compani and should deriv the bulk of it financi return from grow profit and EPS, rather than through rapidli expand it top line. Amazon' growth trajectory, meanwhile, is generational, as it look to rewrit the rule of the global retail industry. In the end, Amazon strike me as the better stock for long-term investor to buy today.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The compani announc a day prior to the IPO that it would sell 200 million share for $17 per share, which wa the largest U.S. IPO sinc 2014. Although the compani ha never turn a profit, investor jump on board the IPO wagon, send it share up 44%, to $24.48, when share hit the market on Thursday.Th IPO made a lot of peopl rich, includ Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, who sold at least $272 million worth of share and still own roughli $3.6 billion, accord to MarketWatch. Snap' IPO rais almost $2.5 billion for the parent compani and anoth $1 billion for the founder and earli investors.But now the real work begins, becaus Snap just as easili could go the way of Twitter, which declin consist after it IPO, rather than Facebook, which becam a tech juggernaut in the year follow it IPO. Snap ha roughli 158 million user -- mostli between the age of 18 and 24 -- and is growing.Now, it' just a matter of if and when Snap can better monet it grow user base consistently. Thi is a task much easier said than done -- just ask Twitter.Bad opticsEveri kiss begin with Kay, but that brand imag might not be what consum and investor think of first forSignet Jewel Ltd(NYSE: SIG) , the owner of Kay Jewel and Jared, among others. TheWashington Postreport that hundr of former employe claim the company' CEO and other manag member allow a corpor cultur of sexual harass and discrimination.Th attorney were onli grant permiss to releas the statement publicli Sunday, and the headlin sent share of Signet Jewel stock down roughli 13% dure intra-day trade on Tuesday.

Investor were quick to react to Microsoft' announc and sent GameStop share quickli down 10% dure intra-day trading.In my opinion, GameStop is an age dinosaur that look to be head the way of Blockbust in an increasingli digit world. The company' top and bottom line have been stagnant sinc 2010. Without a growth story, in addit to an increasingli digit world, there doesn't seem to be much valu left in own shares.

Inside Snapchat: The Biggest Tech IPO Since Facebook,3/3/2017,"Snap Inc.SNAP, parent compani of Snapchat, recent made it histor market debut. It wa the second-largest U.S.-bas technolog IPO ever, behind onli FacebookFB, one of it key industri competitor no less.Snapchat is one of the most popular messag and social media app on the market today. It humbl began as a class project by former Stanford Univers student Evan Spiegel (now CEO), Reggi Brown, and Bobbi Murphy. (For an insid look at Mr. Spiegel, check out thi Zack article:Can Snapchat' Evan Spiegel Be the Next Mark Zuckerberg?)Launch offici in 2012, Snapchat allow user to take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a control list of recipients. These photo and video disappear within 1-10 seconds-th amount is up to the sender-aft the recipi view them.What Make Snapchat So Popular?Y know you'r do someth right when huge tech corpor begincopyingal of your ideas. Giant like Facebook and MicrosoftMSFThav spent the better part of four year tri to emul Snapchat, debut new tool and featur that are shamelessli similar to what the startup is known for.What make the app so compelling?Ev sinc it debut, Snapchat ha steadili climb the social media ranks, have gain the top spot among teenag over TwitterTWTR, Facebook, and even Instagram (though the photo-shar app is swiftli close ranks). Accord toMashable, who cite a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teen were poll ""to see what they felt wa the most import social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, follow by Twitter and Facebook.""Ov the last year or so, Snapchat ha been launch new uniqu featur after new uniqu feature, introduc thing like Snapchat Discover, expand it video and pictur filter library, and partner with event like the Oscars, where the app let it user watch live behind-the-scen footag of the red carpet and the actual show.Teenag love Snapchat, and teenag are a covet demograph for ani tech company. The studi both demonstr Snapchat' incred abil in captur thi fickl group of people, as well as whi teenag prefer thi kind of digit platform.Ephemer EngagementSnapchat is a social, ephemer experi that favor photo and video over text-bas media, and the compani ha made these qualiti a prioriti in it develop and busi model. Engag is not new for social media applications. In fact, it is veri import to all social media companies, as engag is the drive revenu factor, besid advertising. Snapchat, though, is approach it in a complet differ way.Harvard Busi School (HBS) Professor Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhanioff an interest perspectiveon thi idea. In an introduct to the elect cours ""Digit Innov and Transformation"" present in HBS' Digit Initiative, Iansiti and Lakhani argu that Snapchat is ""not just a messag system, but also a social network, community, and an ad platform.""Most importantly, Snapchat is anephemeralsoci network, community, and ad platform. Their unique, yet increasingli popular applic method is a major contribut factor to their success.Ians and Lakhani continue, argu that ""Snapchat provid a window into thi challeng question: what drive valu creation and captur in today' digit economy?"" In other words, Snapchat offer a busi model perfect for our current digit economy, monet ephemer in an innov way.Advertis & VideoNot onli is Snap monet ideas, but it is also attempt to make money off it intens high user base-th compani ha roughli 100 million daili activ users-bi introduc transient advertis that disappear after a set amount of time.Thi is a basic, yet clever, busi move for the company. The combin of a larg user base and high daili activ is a goldmin for advertisers. Snap recogn this, and smartli charg an astound $750,000 minimum for a day of advertising. By charg per day instead of the usual per click, the compani is let go of the typic internet advertis model.Th price may be stagger for some, but becaus of Snapchat' huge, engag audience, their earli ad product have attract big-nam buyer like McDonald'sMCD, SamsungSSNLF, Macy'sM, and ComcastCMCSA-own Univers Studios.Video is anoth medium that Snapchat is capit off of. Accord to a recentBloombergreport, Snapchat is now get around 10 billion video view a day, with more than a third from it ""Stories"" feature. Thi figur is impress becaus Snapchat is mobile-only. In comparison, Facebook' last report video count wa 8 billion daili views, which includ both mobil and desktop traffic.Th issu of what count as a video, however, may be a potenti problem for the app go forward. Snapchat' video are onli a few second long, and most of the video disappear onc they are viewed. The compani will need to clarifi what they see as a video view in order to accur paint a convinc picture.Problem to ConsiderDespit all of the company' posit aspects, Snapchat doe not come without controversy. Becaus of it ephemer platform, Snapchat ha been associ with sexting, a news topic that garner wide public attent whenev report on. To some, the app is a perfect tool for sexting, as ani inappropri content quickli disappears.Th compani ha also been caught in racial controversies. On last April 20, the unoffici marijuana holiday, Snapchat releas a new face filter meant to make user look like late regga legend Bob Marley. The filter add a Marley-styl hat, dreadlocks, and darken users' skin town, which had some peopl dub the filter as a form of digit blackface.And also last year, Snapchat releas a filter len that caus users' face to look like caricatur of Asian people, with shut eye and rosi cheeks. Snapchat toleTh Vergethat ""the len wa inspir by anime, and wa meant to be playful."" It wa eventu taken down, and will not be put back into circulation.Snap also lost a number of execut after brief stay dure it time as a startup. In 2014, the compani lost Peter Magnusson, who wa the VP of Engineering, after six months. And in 2015, revenu boss Mike Randal leav after a short, seven-month stint, with COO Emili White and HR chief Sara Sperl depart that year as well. Shannon Petranoff, a former Paramount VP who join Snapchat in March of 2015, return back to Paramount that September, while Jill Hazelbaker, VP of commun and policy, left for Uber after a year at Snap.An IPO for the Ages?Th hype surround Snap' IPO was, to put it bluntly, insane. The compani origin price it initi public offer at $17 per share, which came in abov the expect rang of $14 to $16 per share and valu Snap at $24 billion. However, becaus of such high demand, SNAP stock start trade on the NYSE at $24 a share, rise as high as $26.05 at one point dure the day.Mor than 200 million shares, which wa the entir size of the offering, chang hand over the cours of the day and account for roughli 10% of the total volum of trade on the NYSE; Snap' IPO end up be 12 time oversubscribed, mean there were 12 time more order than there were share offered. Share of Snap close their first day of trade up 44% to $24.48 per share, boost it market cap to roughli $33 billion.CEO Evan Spiegel ha alway recogn the import of an IPO, andtoldRe/codeat it annual confer back in 2015 that ""[Snap] need to IPO. We have a plan to do that."" He did not give detail back then but stress that ""an IPO is realli important."" Now that the compani ha made that giant step, it eager investor are wonder what' next for the company.Sinc it launch, Snap ha mold itself as a compani for the digit age and technology-ground economy, and huge corpor want in from the get-go. Back in 2013, the compani caught the attent of both Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogl division. They offer to acquir Snapchat for $3 billion and $4 billion, respectively. In a bold, but smart move, Snapchat turn down both offers, with attent from investor rise exponenti as a result from the decision.Snap' primari demographic, smart advertis strategy, and ephemer busi model made the compani quit the IPO catch. Despit have made no money yet-Snap lost $514.6 million in 2016, and warn that it ""may never achiev or maintain profitability,"" accord to it IPO prospectus-thes things, plu it ""cool factor,"" lure investor in droves, mark an IPO for the ages.Interest in the other top stori of the week?

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Hopes Old Phone Revival Can Help NOK Stock,3/3/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh high-tech world is still buzz afterNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) andBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) show off new handset at last weekend' Mobil World Conference. However, I'm not sure nostalgia for candi bar phone and keyboard PDA draw the right kind of attent to either company.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Schedul / Grid Engin via Flickr (Modified)For one, NOK never realli left the ""dumb"" end of the phone market behind, so the company' grand ""return"" with a new version of it near-indestruct 3310 handset - popular in 2001 at a price around $120 - is onli a shock to peopl who stop pay attention, which they did for a reason.Granted, the featur phone that NOK recent pull back out ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) orbit account for 9% of the categori last year, but that No. 2 share behindSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) onli ad up to 35 million handsets, or at best 2% of the global phone market.A Lesson in Scale for NOK StockSure, it' remot possibl that the return of the 3310 at $50 will somehow dramat revers 16 year of technolog progress, and be enough to convinc a new gener of back-to-bas consum to trade in their smartphones, I find it unlikely.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017I just don't see that happen here in number that even doubl NOK' market share, and even if it does, an extra 35 million $50 handset sold close to cost realli isn't go to move the needl for NOK stock. Even if the compani manag to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it' go to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That' the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it' still a big company, built on the chassi of the old Alcatel and Lucent network businesses. Now that it ha it phone back from MSFT, manag need to deploy them to embrac the futur and expand on the role the compani want to play in the Internet of Thing (IoT).To me, that mean develop phone that don't compet withAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consum pocket space, but one that instead let smart devic commun with each other. Consid that, in a world of billion of $50 machine-to-machin data relays, the market becom veri interest for NOK stock investors.It' a similar stori for BBRY, which wa evolv nice into an IoT proposition, until now. We may feel nostalg for the day of a ubiquit busi BlackBerry, but that era wa over more than a decad ago. We'v sinc learn to type on virtual keyboards.7 Stock to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buy RangeTh question I have about the next gener of BBRi devic revolv around what great thing they can do to win consum away from the iPhon and Android that alreadi domin the market. They need to trigger a revolut and not just recapitul the past.Th bottom line is, as interest as it wa to get a blast from the past from these two companies, I just don't see thi strategi be a boon for either stock right now.Hilari Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octan Trader,Absolut Capit ReturnandValu Authority.

"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last?",3/3/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf I'm be pain transparent, I almost want to callAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) ""fake news."" A littl more than two year ago, AMD stock wa trade for under two bucks. Now, it ha been toy with $15 with littl sign of slow down. And I don't consid a near 5% loss on the day to be a sign of anything. Thi is especi true consid Advanc Micro Devic is up 22.6% for the year so far.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrI understand the point that ralli can be extrem pronounc from the depth of market volatility. We'v seen similar pattern in the number one rival for AMD stock:Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Those that bought the dip inNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) and held on for the big surg were handsom rewarded.But these are compani that are recogn leader in their field of specialty. AMD, in contrast, histor ha been the discount leader, play catch-up with the big boys.Still, AMD stock regist an amaz 295% run last year. Even more astounding, specul that caught AMD in mid-Februari of 2016 saw their invest rise by around 600%! Go in hard with a coupl perform like that and you'll be out of the rat race in no time.But is there ani growth remain in Advanc Micro Devices?A Game Changer (Literally!) for AMD StockInvestorPlac contributor Joseph Hargett certainli think so. Hi bullish isn't base just on the momentum beget momentum thesis. Rather, Hargett see the company' latestRyzen CPUa a game changer, someth that will put the hurt on Intel. From the initi reports, it' hard to disagree.3 Ignor Tech ETF That Are Too Good to Pass UpRyzen will go head-to-head with Intel' flagship i7 processor, which isn't a surpris move in and of itself. Advanc Micro Devic and Intel have alway war for consum attent like bitter siblings. Naturally, Intel ha had the upper hand, wherea AMD wa consid the ""poor man' Intel."" That same dynam can be found in the markets, with AMD stock gyrat from euphoria to despair and back again.Although it' a commonli express sentiment with mix results, thi time could be differ for Advanc Micro Devices. The Ryzen is arm with more featur than the i7, includ attribut that are vital to it core video-gam base.Most importantly, it clock in at half the price of it rival' offering, which will inevit draw much excitement. AMD ha previous suppli chip toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) for their video game systems.On the technic front, Hargett note that there' significantshort activityin AMD stock. All it would take are a few good reviews, and that will send share move higher. Those who are short Advanc Micro Devic will have to cover their posit to stay in it. But the overwhelm upsid pressur could be too much, forc them to close their transaction. In order to do that, borrow share of AMD stock that initi the short would have to be bought back.Aft those market gymnastics, demand for AMD shoot even higher.Advanc Micro Devic Still Ha to Face the MusicOf course, the obviou risk is whether or not the comput industri bites. Mayb after intens reviews, the Ryzen isn't what it seem to be. After all, we are talk about semiconductors. Thi sector ha a bloodi histori of punish misstep - and not everyon make it out alive. Consid that AMD stock is still veri much a specul investment, the obviou risk is not one to take lightly.I think we can all appreci the moxi that Advanc Micro Devic ha shown. Other compani could have simpli fold under the trials, but not AMD - good for them. But we also can't ignor the realiti of the situation. AsInvestorPlacecontributor Ryan Furhmann notes, ""Intel is expect to report sale of around $59 billion thi year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, make it about7% the sizeof Intel.""Du to the eas of the suppli glut in comput chip products, some might think we'r enter into a semiconductor renaissance. I look at it more as the chang of the tide. However, the ocean is still the ocean. AMD stock and other can enjoy the favor tailwind, but eventually, there will be anoth challenge.Th question is, will AMD be strong enough to weather it?It' a Super-Riski PropositionIf you look at the technic momentum, you have to like the chanc for AMD stock. Share are move firmli in a bullish trend channel. Asid from some overh readings, the standard technic baromet are signal green. As Wall Street like to say, the trend is your friend.Click to EnlargeOrdinarily, I'd agree. But darn it, the fundament pictur for AMD stock is ugly. It' so ugli that I would refer a part of the human anatomi as a prefix if I could. But I'm go to keep it clean.Here' the deal - base on the Altman Z-score, the onli thing that Advanc Micro Devic ha been do is move from one state of distress to another. We'r not argu whether the compani is on stabl ground: it' not. We'r just analyz magnitud of troubles.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beat the OddsFor a contrarian, buy when other are sell is an art form. But what happen when everybodi els is buy the same troubl stock? Furthermore, shouldn't an embattl compani make substant stride of improvement?Strictli from the data, AMD move from intract distress to ""normal"" distressed. That is an improvement, I'll concede. But at some point, the dial ha got to move to at least a grey zone. Sadly, AMD stock is well far away from that. So even though it ha been an incred ride, I think investor need to be cautiou here.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto wa long SNE stock.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 201710 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowTh postAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.

Thi sound shamelessli familiar to Snapchat Stories, which also allow user to post photo and video in a slideshow format that disappear after 24 hours.Thi isn't the first time Instagram ha tri to replic Snapchat. Back in 2014, it launch Bolt, a privat messag servic that let you send one-tap photo and videos, much like Snapchat, but is now defunct.Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom ha alreadi acknowledg the blatant similar between the respect Stories,tellingTechCrunchthat ""[Snapchat] deserv all the credit,"" but that ""Thi isn't about who invent something. Thi is about format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.""I mean, sure, put your own spin on thing is cool, but they could have at least come up with a differ name.And Then There' FacebookFacebook (NASDAQ:FB-Fre Report), (who coincidentally, or conveniently, own Instagram), ha been format mani of it new featur and app base off of Snapchat for a few year now. In late 2012, Facebook launch Poke, an almost exact clone of Snapchat that unsurprisingli failed, and then in 2013, it tri to straight up buy Snapchat for a whop $3 billion. Snapchat turn down that offer, spur atech chase for the ages.Follow Poke, Facebook announc it app call Slingshot in 2014, which work exactli like Snapchat but with one distinct feature: befor a user could view a message, they had to send a messag back. These requir repli last for onli three month befor Facebook remov them from Slingshot, and the app sat around for about a year afterward befor be offici removed.Oth Snapchat rip-off ventur of Facebook includ disappear posts, disappear messag in Messenger, photo edit option where you can swipe through filter and posit text and emoji, face-alt filter thank to it acquisit of the app MSQRD, a face-swap app, and Messeng Codes, which are scannabl dot and dash around your profil pictur let you add a person as a contact. Messeng Code is almost exactli the same as Snapchat' Snapcodes.Th compani recent debut a new Snapchat-lik featur in it WhatsApp Messeng platform that let user post pictur and video to a new feed that delet itself after 24 hours, dub ""WhatsApp Status."" Find out more about that in the latest episod of Zack Tech Talk Tuesday with host Ryan McQueeneyhere.Facebook isn't the onli big compani look at Snapchat for new ideas. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Fre Report) also ha a Snapchat clone on the market call WindUp, which let user share photo and videos, as well as text and audio snippets. You can set a time limit for your friend to view messag befor they expire, or can stick to a tradit view limit. WindUp isstil availablein Microsoft' app store.Even Wall Street newbi Line (NYSE:LN-Fre Report), the Japanes messag app, also ha Snapchat-lik features. In 2014, the compani updat it app so that user can send content to their friend as hidden photo or messages, which will not display until the receiv click on them. And, the photo or messag will disappear depend on the time set by the sender.Snapchat, King of the TeensIf all of these influenti tech and internet compani have spent the better part of four year tri to emul Snapchat, then what is it about the app that make it so compelling? Whi is everyon copi Snapchat?Ev sinc it offici debut in 2012, Snapchat ha steadili climb the social media ranks, have gain the top spot among teenag over Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Fre Report), Facebook, and even Instagram. Accord toMashable, who cite a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teen were poll ""to see what they felt wa the most import social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, follow by Twitter and Facebook.""Ah, so that' why: teenag love Snapchat, and teenag are a covet demograph for ani tech company.Ov the last year or so, Snapchat ha been launch new uniqu featur after new uniqu feature, introduc thing like Snapchat Discover, expand it video and pictur filter library, and partner with event like the Oscars, where the app let it user watch live behind-the-scen footag of the red carpet and the actual show.Snapchat is asocial, ephemer experiencethat favor photo and video over text-bas media. And as the studi shows, teenag prefer thi type of digit platform.Whi Snapchat RulesBut I think it' more than just that. Snapchat ha been consist keep it platform interest and innovative, while other social media compani have more or less remain stagnant, or just copi Snapchat' ideas. Snapchat is fresh, and it ha creat a world inhabit mostli by teenag and young adult and their favorit brand and celebrities. No parent allowed.It' no wonder, then, that everyon is tri to copi Snapchat. It CEO is 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, a guy who more or less invent the app as part of a class final dure hi time at Stanford. It' the prefer app for ani major live event or top celebrity. Abov all, Snapchat is cool. Where Facebook appeal to older gener and Instagram to ""captur the perfect moment,"" Snapchat is for everyth in between.Snapchat is for the ""real,"" or at least the real behind text, emoji, filters, and face swaps. And for most peopl in the social media age, and especi teenagers, ""real"" reign supreme.About Zack Equiti ResearchZack Equiti Research provid the best of quantit and qualit analysi to help investor know what stock to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continu coverag is provid for a univers of 1,150 publicli trade stocks.

Gate step down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competit landscap from him.In additon, Googl founder Larri Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt travel to Omaha to talk to Buffett when set up the new Alphabet structure, which is mold after Berkshire.Shortli befor the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understand the tech founders' goal for the company.Buffett includ the follow paragraph in the 2017 sharehold letter, put my spider sens on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor assert that 'Bi 2029 no comput - or 'machin intelligence' - will have pass the Ture Test,' which deal with whether a comput can success imperson a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the oppos view. Each back up hi opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win thi bet, but I will confid wager that no comput will ever replic Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundi of Microsoft assert that pilotless plane would routin fli passeng by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Googl argu otherwise. The stake were $1,000 each. To eas ani heartburn Eric might be experienc from hi outsiz exposure, I recent offer to take a piec of hi action. He promptli laid off $500 with me. (I like hi assumpt that I'll be around in 2030 to contribut my payment, should we lose.)""Thi paragraph show Buffett ha been studi the tech world veri hard and is open to the possibl the Ture test will be crack by 2029. He also must have look into the dynam of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent invest into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think bet against Buffett is gener a profit endeavour. What jump out at me is, apparently, Alphabet' chairman and Buffett recent spoke again. They must have spoken for quit some time for the subject of thi casual bet to come up.Al these factor have led me to specul on the potenti of an Alphabet investment.Th piec are fall into place.Buffett ha been studi tech intensely.Berkshir ha made a 180 as far as tech invest go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as have an incred strong moat.Alphabet' valuat is at an attract level given the interest from the valu invest greats. Porat is a great addit to the execut suit ,cover up pre-exist weak in the team.Googl execut have met with Buffett on multipl occas and Schmidt talk to him recently.Th one thing I could see keep Buffett from make an invest is hi distast for stock-bas compensation. Alphabet continu to dole it out like it is candi on Halloween.I would go as far as to say it would greatli surpris me if we do not see Berkshir buy a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.Disclosure: Author own none of these stocks.Start afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

What Does Warren Buffett See in Apple?,3/2/2017,"SinceWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)' annual letter came out and he follow up with a lengthi interview on CNBC where he talk about how much moreApple(AAPL) stock Berkshir now own - and how he wa the one who bought most of it - I have gotten a lot of email question ask about hi purchase.Thi is not the first time I have receiv a slew of email question the logic of one of Buffett' investments. Sinc I have been write articl about investing, he ha made four invest that realli got a reaction from valu investor who doubt the logic of what he wa doing. These include: Buffett' initi purchas of railroad stock and hi subsequ purchas of all of Burlington Northern, hi invest inIBM(IBM) despit him have said he doe not invest in tech stocks, hi invest in the four major U.S. airlin despit the fact he ha said the airlin industri is a terribl one for investor and now hi invest in Apple.Berkshir Hathaway' (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) invest in Appl is far from the most controversi of these cases. A bunch of other valu investor like the stock. It is a reason price stock on an enterpris valu basi - Appl ha a lot of net cash, so it market cap exagger the valuat be put on the company. But, each of these invest by Buffett is an exampl of him move into an area he had not previous touched. I am not sure Buffett ever invest in a railroad stock despit the fact that when he start hi career - in the earli 1950 - railroad stock were a much bigger part of the invest landscap than they are today. Buffett may not have bought tech stock befor IBM - but it is, in most everi other respect, the kind of stock Buffett would normal buy.makeArticleAd();Also, Buffett previous said the reason he never ownedMicrosoft(MSFT) wa becaus no matter whether it wa true or not - peopl would assum the purchas wa the result of insid inform from hi friend,Bil Gates(Trades, Portfolio). He also said, however, that at one pointMicrosoft stockgot to a price - presumably, thi is sometim after the 2008 financi crisi - that seem low to him. Buffett rare talk about whether the price of a stock seem low, high, etc. unless he understand someth about that busi and that industry. So, it is not unreason to think Buffett believ he understand some thing about Microsoft. And those thing might allow him to - within a veri wide valu rang - know whether even a tech stock like Microsoft is cheap or not.Now, let' look at Apple. What doe Buffett see in that stock? The number one thing that appeal to Buffett about Appl is someth that should not matter at all to you. Buffett is attract to Apple' size. It is a huge stock. Buffett said on that same CNBC interview I mention that Berkshir wa unlik to take a bigger than 10% stake in a compani becaus of the problem that presents. Berkshir ha end up with more than 10% of a company' stock, but that ha often been help along by share repurchas on the part of the compani itself.Right now, Ted Weschler and Todd Comb are each run $10 billion portfolio at Berkshire. Those are the small portfolios. Buffett is invest at a whole order of magnitud more in size. But, let' start with just the kind of idea Weschler and Comb need to come up with.Assum you are run a $10 billion portfolio that is fulli invest in common stocks. Further assum you want to avoid buy more than 10% of a company' stock. Now, assum you are a concentr type investor the way Buffett is. As I write, my own portfolio is 65% invest in just two stocks:Frost(CFR) andBWX Technologies(BWXT). It is 85% invest in just three stocks. The third stock, however, is a micro-cap. Manag invest billion of dollar cannot even look at a micro-cap. The veri smallest stock they can possibl buy are thing like Frost and BWX Technologies. So, how much of their portfolio could they put in those two stocks? Remember, I have 65% of my portfolio in those stocks.Well, if you are manag $10 billion, and you are buy stock in a compani with a market cap of about $6 billion (which is about the size of Frost and BWX), you can put just under $600 million into the compani without cross the 10% ownership threshold. So, say you have two good idea that are each $6 billion compani - put them both togeth and you get just 12% of your portfolio in those stocks. Now, for me personally, I do not want to spend time worri about a stock that is much less than 20% of my portfolio. Here, we are talk about stock that are 6% of your portfolio if you buy absolut as much of them as possible. You see the problem. And I have underst it.Buffett is run about 10 time what Weschler and Comb are run individually. And neither Frost nor BWX Technolog is a small company. Within it nich of Texan banks, Frost is the biggest. And within it nich of nuclear work for govern rather than civilians, BWX Technolog is the biggest. So, Buffett cannot be look for compani that have market cap of $6 billion. He want compani with market cap of $60 billion or even $600 billion. Appl ha a market cap of even more than $600 billion. So, here we have a compani where instead of put just 5% of your portfolio into the stock at the veri most, you might get the chanc to put 10%, 20% or even 50% of your portfolio into the stock. When Buffett wa run hi partnership, he like to put 25% into hi best idea. In the case ofAmerican Express(AXP), he even went beyond that. If we do a littl math with the amount of money Buffett manag at Berkshire, we can see that idea in the $100 billion to $700 billion market cap rang are really, realli use to him becaus he can potenti deploy $10 billion to $70 billion (10% of the valu of these kind of companies) into such gigant public companies.Think about what kind of compani you have in the $100 billion to $700 billion range. It is pretti limited. Buffett like focus companies. He like brands. A great idea for Buffett is someth likeCoca-Cola(KO), American Express,Wel Fargo(WFC),Moody's(MCO), or Gillette. Those were great idea becaus they were not just big companies. They did veri few thing in a veri big way. Buffett' stake in Gillett got swap intoProct & Gamble(PG) stock. He eventu did a deal to get out of P&G by take control of Duracell. Duracel is a big brand like Gillette. P&G is an even bigger company, but onli a few of it brand are huge in a way that is use to Buffett. P&G as a whole is more diversifi into thing that are not realli as good as Gillett is on a standalon basis.Not onli is Appl a huge company, it is a huge focus company, which is attract to Buffett. Apple' fortun are now tie to one brand (a they realli alway have been) and larg to one product (the iPhone). When you listen to what Buffett said about Apple, you realiz how import thi is. Buffett said he like Apple. He said he see how integr the iPhon is to the live of peopl - especi young peopl - who now have it. And he say that he see - at place like the Nebraska Furnitur Mart store he own - that peopl upgrad from one iPhon to anoth instead of consid compet brands. So, the invest thesi is surprisingli focus for a giant company. It realli ha to do with one brand and one product, the iPhone. That is it. Buffett can evalu the sticki of one consum product and one brand. That make Appl easier to understand than Procter & Gambl orDisney(DIS) or other giant consumer-ori busi that are actual much more diversified. Appl is not diversified. That is the potenti attraction.Mov on, Buffett think Apple, like IBM, is not go to do a lot of big acquisitions. He think the compani is go to buy back a lot of it own stock. Thi is a veri common theme in a lot of hi investments. One of the surest sign you can find for a ""catalyst"" that might chang hi think about a compani is that compani turn inward and focus on the thing it doe best while dedic it free cash flow toward reduc it share count year after year instead of expand into other areas.Buffett is not an activist investor, but if you look at those area where he ha been most vocal - either while on a board, in the way he abstain from a vote or what he said to the press - it is almost alway a capit alloc decision. It is usual relat to the issuanc of compani stock. Sometim it is relat to overpaying. Nonetheless, he is constantli urg the manag of the compani he invest in to focu on widen their moat, do what they do best and invest in themselv at a reason price (bi buy back their own stock) rather than invest in somebodi els by overpaying.Th onli time I can think of Buffett have ani complaint about Coca-Cola had to do with an acquisit the compani want to do (at too high a price) or with give stock to top executives. The stock grant to execut incid at Coke wa report in the press as Buffett complain about execut be overpaid. I think the reason he abstain on that vote had more to do with the fact the compani would be permit to caus a lot of dilut if it use the program to the full extent it wa ask sharehold approv for. So, it wa probabl more about Buffett want Coca-Cola to shrink it share count rather than grow it.When Buffett wa ask on CNBC about the growth prospect of both IBM and Apple, he answer by talk about share buybacks. Befor Buffett bought it, IBM had one of the longest and most aggress histori of buy back it own stock you can find at ani public company. A lot of Berkshire' invest have thi feature. Look at how much American Express ha shrunk it share count sinc Buffett bought that position. Or look at how much Coca-Cola ha bought back of it own stock. In both cases, I'm pretti sure Berkshire' invest are worth at least 33% more than they otherwis would be becaus these compani have shrunk their share count by more than 25% while Berkshir own them. Buffett mention in the CNBC interview that Appl had bought back almost 5% of it stock in a year. That is unlik to be a one-tim thing. Appl will have problem with where it cash is locat - it will end up with a lot of cash that would be tax if brought back to the U.S. - but it doe not need cash to grow, it cannot grow that fast anymor organ and it doe not do big acquisitions.For a tech compani it size, Appl ha histor been especi avers to acquisitions. A compani as profit as Appl that doe not use money on high-priced, transform acquisit is eventu go to have to use that cash to buy back it own stock. There just are not ani other realist options. It could pay dividends; and becaus of Berkshire' own tax status, Buffett would benefit at least as much from dividend as from (fairli or overpriced) buybacks. He doe not mind dividends, and he certainli doe not mind buyback at stock he chose in the first place.What about Apple' lack of futur growth? I think thi actual attract Buffett. That sound counterintuitive. But, let me explain. Appl is a tech stock and a consum product company. The most danger time to invest in tech stock and consum product stock is when they sell a high-pric product to a small pool of customers. The reason for thi is that it allow market entri at the low end. If you are sell $1,000 watch or $10,000 computers, someon can come in sell a cheaper and more basic version of the product to a larg group of peopl who have never own the product. All sort of market leader run into thi problem. They have the biggest dollar share of the industry, but economi of scale - and certainli gain in experi - are driven in larg by the unit volum you do. The leader is in an awkward posit becaus tri to expand the market cut into their profit on a per-custom basis.If you are sell comput to corpor custom - you are not dream of the day when everi live room in America can have a cheap, basic desktop. That futur is potenti bad for you in sever ways. One, it teach whoever you are compet with a lot about mani of the thing you do. Two, it cheapen the imag of what you are selling. Three, it chang the way you will have to sell what you are selling. Almost all technology, especi ani sort of consum tech, follow thi pattern. It can be veri tough for investor becaus it lead to a two-stag adopt of the technology.In phase one, one leader establish their domin in the ""pro"" market and the stock look great. But, in phase two, anoth - and usual differ - leader establish their domin in the ""consumer"" market. Then that stock look great at the expens of the first leader. We could be talk about comput or cell phone here. But if you go back further in history, TV and radio follow the same pattern too. These thing are alway invent long, long befor you rememb them be invented, but were not adopt quickly. Peopl tend to rememb when they start see cell phone everywhere, when they start use the internet in their own home and so on. Those year have noth to do with when these product were first invented, commerci and so forth. Often, there wa a compani you have complet forgotten about that made and lost a fortun befor the time period you even think of the new consum tech as be suddenli import to society.What doe thi have to do with Apple? It is part of a broader question. Just how ""moaty"" are consum technolog companies? At least on one side of the econom valu equation, compani like Apple,Facebook(FB) andAlphabet' Googl (GOOG)(GOOGL) depend entir on the mass appeal of their product. We call them technolog companies. Internally, I am sure they seem veri technic to those insid the organization. But how much doe technolog drive the econom return at these companies? And, at thi point, how easi is it to attack ani of these busi model on some technic differ between your product and theirs? How much of what make the iPhon success is the Appl brand, the fact a custom alreadi own an iPhon and is use to use it, the fact a customer' friends, famili and peer alreadi own an iPhon and, as a consequence, the fact other entrepreneur and organ have invest time money and effort in tri to reach peopl by design product to be use on an iPhone?In other words, ha the iPhon becom the default choic for custom becaus the Appl brand is good enough, the statu quo is good enough, peopl are not all go to jump on anoth bandwagon togeth and the supplier are go to be where the demand is? Is the iPhon alway go to be the easiest choice? Thi is exactli the same question for Facebook and Google. A veri long time ago, I wrote that while I did not ownGoogl stockand did not know how the organ would develop over time as a company, I did know that understand anyth technic about a search engin no longer mattered. Googl doe not need to be the world' best search engin to be the world' most popular search engine. The advantag it ha are too entrench and the differ between one set of search result and anoth are so small - Googl doe not realli have to compet on qualiti anymore. Googl is enough of a brand and search is enough of a commod that it doe not matter.Th thing that got Appl to the posit it is now in are not necessarili the thing that will keep it there. A lot of reader email me ask about Apple' brand and whether it would last. The answer to that is ye and no. It will be a recogniz brand that is seen as good enough in a decad or two. I would be veri surpris if that changed. On the other hand, I would be surpris if the Appl brand wa seen as be particularli innov or stand for veri specif design choic or anyth like that in a decad or two. Coca-Cola is a great brand, but it is not a veri specif brand. It cannot be anymore. When peopl think cola they think Coca-Cola. And when peopl think phone - they think Apple. But, Appl will not need to convinc anyon to tri a smartphon for the first time anymore. They do not realli even have to convinc anyon to tri an Appl product for the first time anymore.Appl ha veri high return on the money it actual tie up in it business. The number look lower becaus they have excess cash. Likewise, the stock look more expens than it is becaus it ha a lot of excess cash. If Apple' sale grow somewher between nomin GDP and the rate of inflat in the countri where it oper in and the compani dedic everi cent it make - or more, sinc Appl alreadi ha net cash - to buy back it own shares, it will still be a ""growth"" stock on an EP basis. For an exampl of this, see BWX Technologies. It is not realli a growth compani at all in term of what it does. It doe not gain new custom (outsid of the U.S. Navy). It doe not win total new project (outsid of the carrier and sub it ha long provid reactor for). And it doe not even get mani more order for a higher build rate for the number of those ship now than it did in the recent past. Despit all that, the compani just put out a press releas say it expect a ""low double-digit"" EP growth rate for the next three to five years. That is a growth stock, but it is one becaus it is do someth very, veri profit on a return on capit basis. It is retain all the busi it alreadi ha and grow the busi it retain a tini but consist bit, and then it is take all the money it make and buy back it own stock. When a super high-qual busi buy back it own stock, it is not imposs to turn an underli 5% type growth rate in how much more your custom actual want into more like a 10% growth rate in the earn you report per share.IBM is anoth good exampl of that. In the 10 year befor Buffett bought the stock, it wa not veri good at company-wid revenu growth. Over the last decade, IBM had close to 9% annual EP growth at the same time it had close to zero percent revenu growth. A lot of that is accomplish simpli by not grow the asset you tie up in the busi at all (IBM' net tangibl asset actual shrank over the last decade) and then take all your free cash flow and - instead of grow asset like most compani do - use it to reduc your share count.What Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) see in Appl is probabl a slow growth, wide moat consum brand that can use all it free cash flow to buy back it own stock and therebi be a high-growth stock in term of EPS, even while it is slow growth in term of addit unit sold. Appl may not be a growth compani anymore, but that doe not mean it cannot be a growth stock. All Buffett care about is the growth in earn per share. So, he is not necessarili bet Appl can sell a lot more iPhon over the next five to 10 years. What Buffett' bet on is Apple' abil to report a lot more in earn per share over the next five to 10 years.Disclosures: Long CFR, BWXTStart afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."
"As Snapchat IPOs, Its Competition Is Stealing Its Best Ideas",3/2/2017,"Last year, Instagram, the popular photo-shar app, announc a new featur call ""Stories"" where user can post photo and video slideshow that disappear after a 24-hour period. Thi sound shamelessli familiar to Snapchat Stories, which also allow user to post photo and video in a slideshow format that disappear after 24 hours.Thi isn't the first time Instagram ha tri to replic Snapchat. Back in 2014, it launch Bolt, a privat messag servic that let you send one-tap photo and videos, much like Snapchat, but is now defunct.Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom ha alreadi acknowledg the blatant similar between the respect Stories,tellingTechCrunchthat ""[Snapchat] deserv all the credit,"" but that ""Thi isn't about who invent something. Thi is about format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.""I mean, sure, put your own spin on thing is cool, but they could have at least come up with a differ name.And Then There' FacebookFacebookFB, (who coincidentally, or conveniently, own Instagram), ha been format mani of it new featur and app base off of Snapchat for a few year now. In late 2012, Facebook launch Poke, an almost exact clone of Snapchat that unsurprisingli failed, and then in 2013, it tri to straight up buy Snapchat for a whop $3 billion. Snapchat turn down that offer, spur atech chase for the ages.Follow Poke, Facebook announc it app call Slingshot in 2014, which work exactli like Snapchat but with one distinct feature: befor a user could view a message, they had to send a messag back. These requir repli last for onli three month befor Facebook remov them from Slingshot, and the app sat around for about a year afterward befor be offici removed.Oth Snapchat rip-off ventur of Facebook includ disappear posts, disappear messag in Messenger, photo edit option where you can swipe through filter and posit text and emoji, face-alt filter thank to it acquisit of the app MSQRD, a face-swap app, and Messeng Codes, which are scannabl dot and dash around your profil pictur let you add a person as a contact. Messeng Code is almost exactli the same as Snapchat' Snapcodes.Th compani recent debut a new Snapchat-lik featur in it WhatsApp Messeng platform that let user post pictur and video to a new feed that delet itself after 24 hours, dub ""WhatsApp Status."" Find out more about that in the latest episod of Zack Tech Talk Tuesday with host Ryan McQueeneyhere.Facebook isn't the onli big compani look at Snapchat for new ideas. MicrosoftMSFTalso ha a Snapchat clone on the market call WindUp, which let user share photo and videos, as well as text and audio snippets. You can set a time limit for your friend to view messag befor they expire, or can stick to a tradit view limit. WindUp isstil availablein Microsoft' app store.Even Wall Street newbi LineLN, the Japanes messag app, also ha Snapchat-lik features. In 2014, the compani updat it app so that user can send content to their friend as hidden photo or messages, which will not display until the receiv click on them. And, the photo or messag will disappear depend on the time set by the sender.Snapchat, King of the TeensIf all of these influenti tech and internet compani have spent the better part of four year tri to emul Snapchat, then what is it about the app that make it so compelling? Whi is everyon copi Snapchat?Ev sinc it offici debut in 2012, Snapchat ha steadili climb the social media ranks, have gain the top spot among teenag over TwitterTWTR, Facebook, and even Instagram. Accord toMashable, who cite a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teen were poll ""to see what they felt wa the most import social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, follow by Twitter and Facebook.""Ah, so that' why: teenag love Snapchat, and teenag are a covet demograph for ani tech company.Ov the last year or so, Snapchat ha been launch new uniqu featur after new uniqu feature, introduc thing like Snapchat Discover, expand it video and pictur filter library, and partner with event like the Oscars, where the app let it user watch live behind-the-scen footag of the red carpet and the actual show.Snapchat is asocial, ephemer experiencethat favor photo and video over text-bas media. And as the studi shows, teenag prefer thi type of digit platform.Whi Snapchat RulesBut I think it' more than just that. Snapchat ha been consist keep it platform interest and innovative, while other social media compani have more or less remain stagnant, or just copi Snapchat' ideas. Snapchat is fresh, and it ha creat a world inhabit mostli by teenag and young adult and their favorit brand and celebrities. No parent allowed.It' no wonder, then, that everyon is tri to copi Snapchat. It CEO is 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, a guy who more or less invent the app as part of a class final dure hi time at Stanford. It' the prefer app for ani major live event or top celebrity. Abov all, Snapchat is cool. Where Facebook appeal to older gener and Instagram to ""captur the perfect moment,"" Snapchat is for everyth in between.Snapchat is for the ""real,"" or at least the real behind text, emoji, filters, and face swaps. And for most peopl in the social media age, and especi teenagers, ""real"" reign supreme.Last week, Editor Maddi Johnson and Content Writer Ryan McQueeney, host of the Zack Friday Finish Line podcast, preview Snap' IPO on their show.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Worth About $100 Billion Too Much,3/2/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock continu to trade just off all-tim highs, with it market capit now at $500 billion. I continu to be surpris at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock ha risen roughli 150% in just four year - despit littl movement in profits. Adjust earn per share were $2.78 in fiscal 2012 and onli a penni more, at $2.79, in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAdmittedly, there are some reason for the increas in the Microsoft stock price. Both investor and custom are high on the Azur cloud platform. The Surfac product line show signific promise. And CEO Satya Nadella ha receiv top mark from analyst and shareholders.There' a real case that the ""new"" Microsoft is differ from the ""old"" Microsoft, which ha been to the benefit of MSFT stock. Earn growth should return: Wall Street consensu estim forecast a 7% increas in FY17 per-shar earn and 9% the follow fiscal year.But even that doesn't seem enough to keep Microsoft stock abov $60. MSFT is valu at almost 22 time FY17 earnings, a multipl that impli consist growth. Meanwhile, Window and legaci Offic product are declin and most of the new initi cannib exist sales, in at least some manner.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Microsoft obvious isn't go to collapse, and long-await earn growth may just be at hand. But more modest growth expect seem to support a share price closer to $50 than to $60.Growth Driver Simpli Aren't That BigAl the bullish talk surround Microsoft stock seem to focu on the Azur cloud offer and the Surfac line. But those two categori aren't major driver here: combined, they drive less than 10% of total sale (Azur is estim to bring in around$2.5 billion.)To be sure, cloud as a whole is a bigger part of MSFT revenue. The compani is look for a $20 billion run rate in commerci cloud in FY18, which would impli more than 20% of total sale come from the cloud. Surfac is a great product and a Surfac Phone could - final - get Microsoft a consist presenc in the smartphon space.8 of the Most Overr Stock on Wall Street Right NowAl told, I can see the reason for some optim regard the two growth drivers. But not too much, consid that growth in both categori ha some drawbacks.Tak Revenu From ElsewhereTh other issu with count on Azur and Surface, beyond their rel small contribution, is that growth in both categori is come from the exist revenu base. The $20 billion commerci cloud figur sound great - but that growth is come larg from Offic 365 and Azure. Revenu from those product isn't new to Microsoft; much of it is come from legacy, disk-bas Offic custom and/or exist SQL buyers.Even Surfac isn't necessarili a pure growth driver. Take a sale from a rival likeHP Inc(NYSE:HPQ) is a win, but an HP sale still drive Window 10-relat revenu for MSFT. That softwar revenu drop to the bottom line at much higher margin than sale of a Surfac product.Basically, growth isn't 100% organ for Microsoft. It doesn't portend some sort of top-lin acceler for the compani as a whole, nor doe it make MSFT stock a growth play.A Winner In Declin BusinessesAd to those concern is that Microsoft isn't quit as well-posit in the newer areas. Azur is second toAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Servic (AWS). Microsoft want to grow in China, but so doesAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA), which is roll out it own AWS-typ solution.For Offic 365,Tableau Softwar Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challeng Excel - and 27% revenu growth in 2016 suggest DATA is take share from MSFT. Behemoth likeOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and mani other are in the cloud space. Microsoft' Dynam CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM).Ther are still a lot of obstacl and a number of tough competitor in the way of Microsoft' growth. In fact, in most of the key areas, Microsoft is second place, at best.Bottom Line for Microsoft StockOverall, the idea that Microsoft stock is price in acceler growth strike me as far too optimistic. There are driver - but I'm skeptic that all will come through - and in the meantime, Window and disk-bas Offic revenu will continu to decline.Th 150%-plu gain in MSFT stock ha come in larg part from the idea that Microsoft is in a differ posit than it wa in 2012 or 2013. Then, investor were concern about declin PC sales, and the lack of ani real abil for MSFT to grow otherwise.Microsoft is in a better posit now, but it' hardli perfect. PC concern still remain; phones, cloud and notebook are tough space and overal growth continu to be rather muted. There' enough here to expect some sort of EP growth, which like impli a high double-digit multiple. But that, in turn, impli a share price in the $50-$55 price range.That valu Microsoft somewher around $100 billion less than where it trade at the moment. If that sound like a lot of money, bear in mind that Microsoft stock ha ad $300 billion in valu over the past four year and essenti zero in net income.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Flush With CashTh 7 Best ETF for Retir Investors7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Is Worth About $100 Billion Too Muchappear first onInvestorPlace."

If so, investor savvi enough to have ad these three topdividend stocksto their incom portfolio could make out handsomely, becaus all three compani have an opportun to overdeliv on cash flow and profit.A technolog titan turn the cornerIt wasn't too mani year ago that investor were shunningMicrosoft shares, fear that a die PC market would be the end to thi company' long win streak. However, a portfolio of cloud softwar product that are perfectli suit to today' decentr workplac ha caught fire with compani of all sizes, and that' rekindl interest in thi technolog powerhouse.IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.makeArticleAd();To be clear, the company' still got more work to do. The PC busi is still slowing, but next-gener solut are grow quickly, and becaus of their high margins, they'r provid profit-friendli tailwinds. Last quarter, the company' person comput segment revenu fell 5% from a year ago, but that declin wa offset by a 10% jump in product and busi process sale to $7.4 billion and a 8% jump in intellig cloud segment sales. Product and busi process growth wa driven by 47% increas in Offic 365 commerci revenu and 22% growth in Offic consum product and cloud servic revenue. Meanwhile, intellig cloud sale were driven by a 12% increas in server product and a 93% surg in revenu for Azure, it app develop and manag business.Overall, growth in Microsoft' higher-margin busi help the compani deliv non GAAP net incom of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP earn per share of $0.83, up 6% and 9% from a year ago, respectively. That profit growth bode well for dividend investor becaus it mean there' increasingli more money avail for dividend hikes. Currently, investor are get $0.39 per share in quarterli dividends, which work out to a 2.4% dividend yield, at current share prices.Big chang could creat big opportunityA huge amount of uncertainti exist in the health insur industri right now. Donald Trump' win last Novemb mean that a repeal and replac of Obamacar is on deck, and while it' not clear yet what the replac will be, big insur like UnitedHealth Group, the nation' largest insurer, could be rewarded.Aft lose hundr of million of dollar sell Obamacar plans, UnitedHealth Group becam one of Obamacare' biggest critics. The compani decid to exit most of the Afford Care Act' exchang earli last year, and in 2017, it onli offer plan in a hand of states, down from more than 30 state in 2016.Sinc UnitedHealth Group' alreadi exit the major of the ACA states, a repeal is like to be far less disrupt to it than it is to competitors. The company' vast experi in manag health insur plans, however, mean it' still one of the best-posit compani to profit from ani Obamacar replacement.Despit lose money on Obamacar in 2016, UnitedHealth Group remain one of America' most financi healthi insurers. Strength in it Medicaid, Medicare, and employ health insur busi more than offset Obamacar headwind last year, and as a result, full-year oper profit jump 20% to $13 billion and adjust earn per share grew 25% to $8.05 in 2016.Assum Congress replac Obamacar with a more profit alternative, the potenti for UnitedHealth Group to grow it bottom line in the come year is significant. But even if an Obamacar replac is a dud, UnitedHealth can still deliv plenti of dividend-friendli bottom-lin growth. Job growth is boost enrol in it workplac insur plan and age babi boomer offer tremend growth for it Medicar Advantag plans.A set-it and forget-it stockPerhaps, no compani is more deepli tie to global healthcar market than Johnson & Johnson. It over-the-count brand are some of the planet' most wide recognized, and it pharmaceut and medic devic are among the most popular choic of doctor worldwide.Consum brand like Band-Aid keep cash flowing, offset some risk to investors, while a prolif drug research and develop program fuel Johnson & Johnson' growth. For example, it' fastest-grow drug are the multipl myeloma drug Darzalex and the leukemia drug Imbruvica. Darzalex sale soar to $572 million from $20 million in it first full year on the market. Meanwhile, Imbruvica' sale jump 82% to $1.2 billion in 2016 These two drug are emblemat of Johnson & Johnson' success at commerci next-gener medicine.Granted, the drug industri is a hypercompetit and expir patent mean more competit is coming, but manag ha decad of experi navig patent risk, and with some of the deepest pocket in the industry, I'm confid Johnson & Johnson will innov new drug that help it sidestep it competitors.Overall, if you want to own fast-grow dividend stock in your incom portfolio, then there could be better options, but if your goal is to own a steady-Eddi perform with an enviabl track record of dividend increases, then it' hard to argu against buy Johnson & Johnson' stock.10 stock we like better than Johnson and JohnsonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc's Chatbots Hit a 70% Failure Rate,2/28/2017,"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedli scale back it chatbot effort on Messeng after the program fail to fulfil 70% of users' requests.Th Informationreport that those request couldn't be handl without human agents, and bot built by outsid develop ""had issues"" becaus the ""technolog to understand human request wasn't develop enough.""So instead of build a larg ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messeng bot to handl ""a narrow set of cases, so user aren't disappoint by the limit of automation."" Let' see what thi strateg shift mean for Facebook' AI efforts, and whether or not chatbot will ever becom meaning tool for the social network.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Understand Facebook' AI strategyArtifici intellig play a vital role in help Facebook track user and deliv target ads.

In 2013, Facebook launch the FAIR (Facebook Artifici Intellig Research) unit to continu upgrad those AI capabilities.That' where Messeng come in. In 2014, Facebook forc user to download the stand-alon Messeng app to keep chatting. That move -- whichclearli mirroredTencent's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundat for Messeng to becom a ""platform"" which could eventu offer ride hailing, mobil payments, deliveries, game and other servic from a singl app.Facebook' Messeng app. Imag source: Googl Play.That move would give Facebook an ""O within an OS"" to counter the iO App Store andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl Play. Facebook' next step would be toreplaceapp with Messeng chatbots, which were introduc last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entir mobil app store model upsid down.Th prematur rise of the chatbotsIn theory, a busi chatbot could answer questions, make purchas suggestions, process orders, and send ship updat to customers. For customers, have ""conversations"" with these bot would feel more natur than scroll and click through a mobil app. Compani could also cut cost by reduc the number of human custom servic representatives.Facebook tether those bot to Messeng for Business, which provid a live custom servic chat channel for a larg number of businesses.

For example,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) launch it chatbot Tay onTwittera an experimentlast March. Within 24 hours, Tay start tweet racist and sexist comments, forc Microsoft to abruptli pull the plug and issu an apology. Tencent ha also struggl to purg spam and scam bot on WeChat sinc it start let million of account creat their own bots.Facebook' AI tech also wasn't that impress prior to the arriv of it chatbots.

He also point out that while Facebook ha hire plenti of AI talent, it simpli hasn't been work on AI ""for nearli long enough"" to challeng market leader like Google.So what' next for Facebook' AI efforts?Despit those missteps, Facebook probabl won't stop invest in chatbot anytim soon.

"Up 620%, What's Happening With Advanced Micro Devices Stock?",2/28/2017,"Unless you close follow the stock, you probabl had no idea share ofAdvanc Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) are up a gaudi 620% sinc March 2016 in the last 12 months. That is not a typo.makeArticleAd();AMDdata byYCharts.Th ongo ralli in AMD share ha been perhap one of the least discuss but most impress invest storylin in tech in the past year. In fact, AMD' share-pric surg is about three time larger than the incred run inNVIDIAstock over the last year. So what' drive thi wild, newfound bullish in AMD stock? Let' take a look.Understand AMD' stock rallyAMD' busi ha enjoy someth of a turnaround in recent quarters. After see sale fall for seven consecut quarters, AMD ha produc posit sale growth in each of it three most recent quarters. Investor anticip company-specif and industrywid trend will allow AMD to expand it busi presenc in each of it two core oper segment in the year to come.On the game side of it business,MicrosoftandSonywil each refresh their respect consol in the come year to enabl next-gener graphic capabl like 4K video qualiti and virtual realiti (VR) gaming. AMD is the main supplier of semi-custom system-on-a-chip (SOC) for both Microsoft' Xbox and Sony' Playstat game consoles; Soni and Microsoft each consist account for more than 10% of AMD' annual sales.. Microsoft ha alreadi announc it latest Xbox iteration, dub Project Scorpio, which will arriv in time for the 2017 holiday season. Soni ha yet to announc it respons to Scorpio, but major consol releas tend to close follow one another. Mani industri observ believ thi new upgrad cycl will creat a correspond surg in new revenu for AMD that will help extend it current sale growth momentum.In it comput and graphic unit, AMD should enjoy an opportun to catch up withIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) in CPU and NVIDIA in GPU to a certain extent. AMD' forthcom 14 nm Ryzen CPUs, due to launch by March, offer more power perform than Intel' i7 chips. Similarly, AMD' Vega chip appear to be a legitim challeng to NVIDIA' GeForc high-end game GPUs. So there' certainli a fair case to be made that sale will inde improv at AMD in the come year.Al of thi is to say that thing are gener look up at AMD. At the same time though, a few import point caus me to question whether it ralli can continue.Imag source: Getti Images.How much is too much?Though busi condit are inde improv at AMD, it isn't as clear that thi longtim ugli duckl ha perman transform into a swan, for a few reasons.A key piec of AMD' bull thesi is that it current 14 nm Zen server chip have close the gap with Intel' 14 nm Broadwel server microprocessor thi year, larg the result of Intel' decis to not shift it CPU to a 10 nm die shrink, codenam Cannonlake, until the second half of 2017. Bullish analyst see AMD catch Intel at the 14 nm level as creat a window for it to steal server market share from Intel, which inde seem plausible. However, with Intel move to 10 nm by the latter half of thi year, AMD' pariti with Intel server chip seem like to be short-lived, make thi larg market-shar gain difficult to sustain.Equ important, it isn't necessarili clear whether meaning sale growth will translat into actual profit for AMD and it investors. Though the compani ha gone through two separ cost-structur overhauls, in 2014 and 2015, it margin structur ha continu to deteriorate. For example, it gross margin fell from 27% in 2015 to 23% in 2016, even as it saw it revenu increas 12%. Thi suggest AMD' busi model lack the kind ofoper leveragethat could allow it to quickli return to profit if sale continu to rise.In a nutshell, ongo success is by no mean assur at AMD. The compani ha done an admir job capit on it variou opportun in recent years. However, as we saw above, sever structur reason exist that may make it difficult to sustain thi kind of success over the long term.10 stock we like better than Advanc Micro DevicesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors,2/27/2017,"Accord toFinviz.com, there are current more than 3,500 publicli trade stock that pay a dividend. That' an overwhelm number that can make it difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we ask a team of Fool to each pick a stock they think is a great choic for a beginner. They chooseWast Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th benefit of buy disruption-proof businessesTyl Crowe(Wast Management):On of the thing begin investor should learn when make their first dividend invest is how to identifi compani in essenti function of our everyday live with nearli insurmount competit advantag over their competition. These are the kind of compani that will have the price power to grow revenu and profit for decad to come, and return consider valu to shareholders.On compani that fit thi mold incred well is refus handler Wast Management. The compani is the largest refus collect company, and it ha a larg network of landfills, dispos centers, and recycl facil across the U.S. The waste-handl busi inher ha lot of competit advantag for it well-establish players. It' extrem capital-intens to build out a fleet of wast collect vehicles, there are lot of regulatori hurdl involv in open new landfil and maintain exist ones, and it' extrem difficult to disrupt how human gener and handl waste. These thing combin to give Wast Manag a veri favor oper environ where it can pass along rise cost to custom pretti easili and gener a steadi stream of profits.For years, Wast Manag ha taken these competit advantag and turn them into a veri shareholder-friendli business. For more than a decade, the compani ha steadili rais it dividend payment and bought back share to gener high rate of return in what mani would consid a slow-growth business.WM Return on Equiti (TTM)data byYCharts.For begin investors, compani with huge competit advantag like Wast Manag are a great lesson in whi it pay to hang onto stock for the long term. The company' share price gain will never blow anyone' sock off, but it high rate of return in an industri that will like be around for decad will reward those who hold onto their position.Th transit is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believ that new dividend investor should seek out big, highli profit compani for their first investment. That criteria perfectli describ Microsoft, which is whi I think it' a fantast stock for beginners.Microsoft ha been crank out profit for decad thank to it stranglehold on the softwar industry. Product such as Window and Offic are cash cow that have been a depend sourc of revenu for decades. That should hold true for a long time to come.However, Microsoft' stock stagnat for year over worri that the ever-chang tech world would render thi company' product obsolete. Thankfully, that worri got put to rest when Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella ha place an emphasi on move Microsoft' product into the cloud, a decis that' pay off handsom as revenu from product like Azure, Offic 365, and Dynam CRM Onlin are surging. When you add in the growth of other product line such as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft' bottom line ha been post healthi gain in recent years.Look ahead, market watcher believ Microsoft' bottom line will grow by more than 9% annual over the next five years. That seem realist when combin the growth in cloud product sale with it recent complet acquisit of LinkedIn. Add to that the company' rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help but think Microsoft is a terrif stock for new dividend investor to buy.Buy one of Buffett' favorit at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought share of American Express when the company' stock wa sell for bargain prices. Decad later, those share are worth almost 10 time whatBerkshir Hathawaypaid -- but that' onli the tip of the iceberg of what American Express mean for Buffett and Berkshir today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterli dividend, American Express will pay Berkshir almost $195 million in dividend in 2017. That may seem like a paltri yield on it $12 billion stake, but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much American Express' dividend pay base on the origin invest -- the math is much better: Berkshir get paid a roughli 15% yield on it cost for those AmEx shares. And with it prospect and track record, that payout is like to keep grow for year to come.There' a wonder lesson for begin investors: Don't skip the small-yield stock if you'r look for dividends. Sometim your best choic is one like American Express, which ha spent far more time yield below 2% of it market price than abov 3%, but it ha steadili and regularli rais it dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today' paltri yield caus you to miss an excel dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today, trade near 14 time last year' earnings. And with it track record of dividend growth, it could be pay you 15% or more on your origin invest in a coupl of decades.Th compani at the core of our digit worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquit network giant respons for mani of the high-spe router and switch that move financi transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet. It' also establish itself as a strong dividend player with both a decent histori of increas it dividend and reason room to continu rais it go forward. That combin set it up as a great potenti invest for someon just now dip into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid it first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter in 2011, and it ha been increas it sinc then. The company' current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over the gener market. It recent rais it dividend from $0.26 per share per quarter to $0.29, an increas of 11.5%. Even with that increase, Cisco pay out onli around half of it earn in the form of dividends, which give it room to continu increas those dividend as it busi grow over time.Speak of that growth, over the next five years, analyst expect Cisco to be abl to increas it earn by almost 11% per year. If it doe manag to grow at that pace, and it dividend follow suit, investor will receiv around $0.48 per share per quarter five year from now. That' the true power of a strong dividend invest strategy.Learn from a greatJordan Wathen(Costco):Warehous retail Costco is neither cheap nor especi high-yielding, but it is the kind of compani I'd recommend to a friend as a compani to follow and learn from.Costco ha more trait of the ""greats"" than perhap ani other company. For one, it ha the advantag of effici scale, which result from the fact it gener about $120 billion in revenu from just 4,000 products, thu frequent make Costco it suppliers' single-largest customer. That give it power at the negoti table.It' also ridicul good at manag it balanc sheet. Costco manag to sell it inventori befor the bill even come due.Oh -- and it somehow creat a cult follow thatForbesonc dub ""Costcoholics"" for the fact that it loyalist visit the store sever time a week to see what' new. Not mani retail have rabid fan of their off-label brands, but Costco does.Let' get back to the dividend. Costco' current yield of 1% underst it heft as a dividend stock. I think it' like that dividend will grow at a double-digit clip for year to come, as it earn power increas and it pay out a greater percentag of earn to it shareholders. What' more important, especi for beginn investors, is the opportun to use the compani as a case studi to learn about what separ the good busi from the great businesses.10 stock we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors,2/27/2017,"Accord toFinviz.com, there are current more than 3,500 publicli trade stock that pay a dividend. That' an overwhelm number that can make it difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we ask a team of Fool to each pick a stock they think is a great choic for a beginner. They chooseWast Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th benefit of buy disruption-proof businessesTyl Crowe(Wast Management):On of the thing begin investor should learn when make their first dividend invest is how to identifi compani in essenti function of our everyday live with nearli insurmount competit advantag over their competition. These are the kind of compani that will have the price power to grow revenu and profit for decad to come, and return consider valu to shareholders.On compani that fit thi mold incred well is refus handler Wast Management. The compani is the largest refus collect company, and it ha a larg network of landfills, dispos centers, and recycl facil across the U.S. The waste-handl busi inher ha lot of competit advantag for it well-establish players. It' extrem capital-intens to build out a fleet of wast collect vehicles, there are lot of regulatori hurdl involv in open new landfil and maintain exist ones, and it' extrem difficult to disrupt how human gener and handl waste. These thing combin to give Wast Manag a veri favor oper environ where it can pass along rise cost to custom pretti easili and gener a steadi stream of profits.For years, Wast Manag ha taken these competit advantag and turn them into a veri shareholder-friendli business. For more than a decade, the compani ha steadili rais it dividend payment and bought back share to gener high rate of return in what mani would consid a slow-growth business.WM Return on Equiti (TTM)data byYCharts.For begin investors, compani with huge competit advantag like Wast Manag are a great lesson in whi it pay to hang onto stock for the long term. The company' share price gain will never blow anyone' sock off, but it high rate of return in an industri that will like be around for decad will reward those who hold onto their position.Th transit is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believ that new dividend investor should seek out big, highli profit compani for their first investment. That criteria perfectli describ Microsoft, which is whi I think it' a fantast stock for beginners.Microsoft ha been crank out profit for decad thank to it stranglehold on the softwar industry. Product such as Window and Offic are cash cow that have been a depend sourc of revenu for decades. That should hold true for a long time to come.However, Microsoft' stock stagnat for year over worri that the ever-chang tech world would render thi company' product obsolete. Thankfully, that worri got put to rest when Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella ha place an emphasi on move Microsoft' product into the cloud, a decis that' pay off handsom as revenu from product like Azure, Offic 365, and Dynam CRM Onlin are surging. When you add in the growth of other product line such as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft' bottom line ha been post healthi gain in recent years.Look ahead, market watcher believ Microsoft' bottom line will grow by more than 9% annual over the next five years. That seem realist when combin the growth in cloud product sale with it recent complet acquisit of LinkedIn. Add to that the company' rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help but think Microsoft is a terrif stock for new dividend investor to buy.Buy one of Buffett' favorit at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought share of American Express when the company' stock wa sell for bargain prices. Decad later, those share are worth almost 10 time whatBerkshir Hathawaypaid -- but that' onli the tip of the iceberg of what American Express mean for Buffett and Berkshir today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterli dividend, American Express will pay Berkshir almost $195 million in dividend in 2017. That may seem like a paltri yield on it $12 billion stake, but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much American Express' dividend pay base on the origin invest -- the math is much better: Berkshir get paid a roughli 15% yield on it cost for those AmEx shares. And with it prospect and track record, that payout is like to keep grow for year to come.There' a wonder lesson for begin investors: Don't skip the small-yield stock if you'r look for dividends. Sometim your best choic is one like American Express, which ha spent far more time yield below 2% of it market price than abov 3%, but it ha steadili and regularli rais it dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today' paltri yield caus you to miss an excel dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today, trade near 14 time last year' earnings. And with it track record of dividend growth, it could be pay you 15% or more on your origin invest in a coupl of decades.Th compani at the core of our digit worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquit network giant respons for mani of the high-spe router and switch that move financi transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet. It' also establish itself as a strong dividend player with both a decent histori of increas it dividend and reason room to continu rais it go forward. That combin set it up as a great potenti invest for someon just now dip into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid it first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter in 2011, and it ha been increas it sinc then. The company' current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over the gener market. It recent rais it dividend from $0.26 per share per quarter to $0.29, an increas of 11.5%. Even with that increase, Cisco pay out onli around half of it earn in the form of dividends, which give it room to continu increas those dividend as it busi grow over time.Speak of that growth, over the next five years, analyst expect Cisco to be abl to increas it earn by almost 11% per year. If it doe manag to grow at that pace, and it dividend follow suit, investor will receiv around $0.48 per share per quarter five year from now. That' the true power of a strong dividend invest strategy.Learn from a greatJordan Wathen(Costco):Warehous retail Costco is neither cheap nor especi high-yielding, but it is the kind of compani I'd recommend to a friend as a compani to follow and learn from.Costco ha more trait of the ""greats"" than perhap ani other company. For one, it ha the advantag of effici scale, which result from the fact it gener about $120 billion in revenu from just 4,000 products, thu frequent make Costco it suppliers' single-largest customer. That give it power at the negoti table.It' also ridicul good at manag it balanc sheet. Costco manag to sell it inventori befor the bill even come due.Oh -- and it somehow creat a cult follow thatForbesonc dub ""Costcoholics"" for the fact that it loyalist visit the store sever time a week to see what' new. Not mani retail have rabid fan of their off-label brands, but Costco does.Let' get back to the dividend. Costco' current yield of 1% underst it heft as a dividend stock. I think it' like that dividend will grow at a double-digit clip for year to come, as it earn power increas and it pay out a greater percentag of earn to it shareholders. What' more important, especi for beginn investors, is the opportun to use the compani as a case studi to learn about what separ the good busi from the great businesses.10 stock we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is in a Rut, and Income Investors Love It",2/27/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) ha justdeliv second-quart FY17 earningsthat beat expect on Wall Street, but onc again prove that Cisco stock will not be return to growth ani time soon.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCisco report fourth-quart revenu of $11.6 billion, $50 million abov Wall Street consensu estimate, but -1.7% year-over-year. That mark the fifth straight quarter that the compani ha post fall revenue.Sadly, thing appear set to remain that way for at least the next few quarters. After all, Cisco guid to revenu growth of -2% to breakeven for the current quarter, and see non-GAAP per-shar earn come in at 57 cent 59 cents, in line with Wall Street' consensu of 58 cents.Oddli enough, Cisco stock ha tuck on gain of 6% sinc the earn call, revers the selloff that happen immedi after the results. Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investor celebr Cisco' revenu tailspin?Busi Model Transit for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throe of a seriou busi model transition. Sinc it earli days, the compani ha been in the busi of sell switch and router that move data around the internet. That' still true in a big way sinc the compani still deriv more than 40% of it revenu from thi network business.But with more and more compani reli on rent comput servic from the like ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buy less and less of Cisco' hardwar for their data centers.Even wors is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrad to newer devic less often. Further, Cisco is increasingli face tougher competit and cheaper offer from the like ofArista Network Inc(NYSE:ANET), a compani that wa found by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more compani are experi with software-defin network (SDN), and Cisco is find itself caught between a rock and hard place. Last quarter' result say it all: Cisco' switch and rout revenu for the quarter fell 5% and 10% to $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.But CSCO has, over the past few years, been work on a grand plan that involv push for a recur subscription-bas revenu model. Thi essenti mean develop busi that will protect it from the vagari of the boom-and-bust cycl of it core business.Chief execut Chuck Robbin is optimist that Cisco can leverag the lesson glean from it subscription-bas businesses, such as Meraki cloud-control WiFi, Secur softwar and Collabor to build a solid subscript revenu businesses. Cisco' Secur segment wa the brightest spot in the earn report after grow 14% to reach $528 million. Meanwhil the Collabor busi grew 4% to hit $1,062 million.Investor were pleas with Cisco' latest report is becaus it show that the compani is make progress discov new recur revenu streams. The compani announc that product defer revenu relat to softwar and subscript grew 51% to reach $4 billion. Meanwhile, 10% of it $9 billion Product sale is now of a recur nature, up from virtual zero a coupl of year ago.Cash Cow and Dividend MachineFor all it troubles, Cisco remain by far the most domin player in the network business, someth that ha help the compani preserv it fat margins. Dure the last quarter, the company' Product gross margin decreas from 63.4% to 61.1%, but it Servic gross margin increas from 65.1% to 67.7%. Improv margin is a good sign that the company' price power remain undiminished.Healthi margin have allow CSCO stock to becom a cash cow, with annual free cash flow approach $13 billion. Cisco spend a lot of thi cash on M&A activity. Dure the latest earn call, Cisco announc that it wa take AppDynam off the IPO tabl by dole out $3.7 billion for the applic perform manag startup. But incom investor need not worri - in the same vein, Cisco announc that it wa hike it quarterli dividend by 3 cent to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yield a gener 3.5%, among the highest yield in theDow Jone Industri Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco institut the dividend six year ago when it declar a quarterli payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield. Sinc then, the compani ha hike dividend at least onc everi year.Cisco is also sit atop a cash hoard north of $60 billion, most of it stash in oversea accounts. With the Trump administr look to quickli enact legisl to lower corpor tax from 35% to 15% to 20%, Cisco will be in a posit to repatri at least some of that cash and continu reward investors.Mobil World Congress: Appl Inc.

The websit say AMZN' Amazon Web Servic - AW - unit ha told some of it ""larg corpor customers"" of it plan to offer a new suit of product app that will compet against the two domin players.7 REIT That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Offic ha alway been consid a cash cow for the company. The product suit quickli becam the industri standard, the applic of choic for enterprise, school and home PC users. To make it softwar seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycl between major version of Microsoft Office, and to address the grow threat of Google' free Googl App suite, five year ago, the compani began push Offic 365.Thi subscript version of Microsoft Offic brought recur monthli revenu and other advantages. Microsoft expand into Offic app for mobil devic likeAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell onlin storag for Offic 365 users, with OneDrive.Googl Apps/G SuiteGoogl wasn't sit still, though, refin Googl App intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Offic 365, with paid monthli subscript plan and onlin storag options. The compani ha also leverag Googl App and it lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebook - ultra-low-cost laptop that have been give Microsoft fits, especi in the educ market.That educ market is where the potenti for disrupt is realli play out. With it free Googl App and low-cost Chromebooks, Googl upend the educ market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all devic in U.S. classroom were Chromebooks. Thi ha repercuss beyond the classroom, as those student turn into young profession who are more comfort with Google' product softwar than with Microsoft Office.I'v seen the effect first hand. My kid do everyth at school use G Suite, despit Microsoft offer free Offic 365 subscript to student and comput lab full of Window PCs. They ignor Microsoft Offic and Apple' Pages/Numb on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suit for do homework.If Googl could quickli make wave in one of Microsoft' key strongholds, whi couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Whi Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThi is a key question.

Amazon Web Servicesdomin the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from thi divis is a big driver of Amazon' overal growth. Amazon alreadi ha the server in place and it ha sever of the compon need for a product suite, includ it WorkDoc and WorkMail app and the recent announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferenc software.

How Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Squeeze $26B From LinkedIn,2/24/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' been six week sinceMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) close it $26.5 billion acquisit of LinkedIn, the largest deal ever made by the Seattl tech giant. Sinc the acquisit wa announc in June 2016, there have been plenti of opinion surround the steep price paid for the busi network site - somepositive, somenegative- and those question mark will continu to follow Microsoft and MSFT stock until LinkedIn is abl to pay it own way.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart Via FlickrI'm a fan of Microsoft stock - in late December,I predict it would hit $80 in 2017- so I'm definit root for LinkedIn to keep deliv the good as it did in it Q3 2016 earnings, it last report as an independ company.Its$1.18 earn per shareon a non-GAAP basi - 27 cent higher than what analyst were expect - on $960 million in revenu wa a major victori for LinkedIn which also saw membership grow 18% to 467 million compar to the same quarter a year earlier. Most important, it actual made a small GAAP profit of $9.1 million in the quarter.MSFT is on a roll, but it will have to maintain momentum if it' go to have ani chanc of extract futur sharehold valu of $26.5 billion or more over the next few years.Sure, the LinkedIn acquisit is about more than money, but ultim that' one of the key criteria for evalu a deal' success or failure.7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Flush With CashHer are the three thing I believ will make the LinkedIn acquisit a success.Estim Monthli UsersWhil LinkedIn is consid the top social media site for busi networking, it ha just 106 million monthli activ user (MAU) out of 467 million members.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha almost 18 time that, with its1.86 billion MAU.Microsoft might have plan for LinkedIn that go beyond it user number but it' got to keep push the MAU metric higher becaus Facebook' not go to stop grow it user base, especi when it come to help peopl find and secur new jobs.LinkedIn isn't go to captur anyon but the high-incom segment of the workforce; currently, 45% of those earn more than $75,000 use LinkedIn. That' got to be higher.Mobil Is KeyNielsen's2016 Social Media Reportreleas in Januari offer a realli deep dive into the world of social media includ mobil usage. Draw data from 9,000 smartphon user 18 or older, Nielsen wa abl to determin the number of uniqu mobil user for the top 10 social media platforms; Facebook had 178.2 million uniqu user compar to 60.1 million for LinkedIn or just three time the number.If LinkedIn want to captur a bigger social media audience, especi younger busi professionals, it' go to have to get veri smart about it mobil game plan which it appear to have done deliv a revamp mobil site in 2016.""We are see good result with the core experience, with our revamp mobil app drive signific engag growth in 2016,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said dure the company' Q2 2017 confer call. ""Thi quarter, the session on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consist level of growth throughout 2016. We also achiev record level of mobil page view.""LinkedIn TalentTh best thing Microsoft ha done to date regard it purchas of LinkedIn ispromot Kevin Scottto chief technolog offic for the entir company. That suggest that Microsoft didn't just buy a great network site but also got a lot of talent peopl includ Scott, who, in addit to hi exist role at LinkedIn will lead Microsoft' technolog plan as well.A CTO, Scott will be empow to continu to help grow Microsoft' cloud busi by bring it togeth with LinkedIn' network of professionals.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Alphabet, Intel, NVIDIA, Baidu and Microsoft",2/24/2017,"For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - Februari 24, 2017 - Zacks.com announc the list of stock featur in the Analyst Blog. Everi day the Zack Equiti Research analyst discuss the latest news and event impact stock and the financi markets. Stock recent featur in the blog includeAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Fre Report),Intel(NASDAQ:INTC-Fre Report),NVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA-Fre Report),Baidu(NASDAQ:BIDU-Fre Report) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Fre Report).Today, Zack is promot it ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Her are highlight from Thursday' Analyst Blog:Googl Find 'Waze' to Build Self-Driv TechnologyWhen ask some time back about the use case for self-driv cars, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Fre Report) execut said that they were explor alternatives. Thing have chang somewhat sinc then and we have slightli greater clariti on whether Googl will maintain it own fleet, rent out for deliveri of goods, food and/or passeng transport, or whether it will rent vehicl from their maker and sell those servic itself.Mi bet wa alway on the latter, first becaus Googl is primarili a technolog compani and thrive on make the kind of softwar that can take over our lives. Get into the low-margin busi of vehicl mainten and rent just isn't it area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of invest that is go into get these anim on the road isn't justifi unless there is a lucr busi out there with a rel quick payback time.So the company' initi step toward commerci by get key peopl on board and announc the name of the unit as Waymo wa heartening. The goal of thi unit is to develop self-driv technolog for car makers.How Doe All Thi Tie In with the Waze Carpool Service?Waz wa an Isra crowd-sourc map servic provid user with inform such as traffic, road condit and other help pointers, so they could quickli decid their route. At least that' what it wa in 2013 when Googl acquir it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpool servic that get peopl travel in the same direct to travel togeth and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headach to avail the servic like have to book way in advanc or not have anybodi to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyon to becom a driver, so they can't make a live from it.Al thi goe to show that Google' plan in the area probabl aren't crystal and the servic is a temporari measur to access that all-import thing these day call data. Data that can add to the treasur trove Google' alreadi collect through the test drive of it self-driv cars.Th difficulti don't seem to have deter users, however, becaus Googl just announc the expans of the servic to unannounc locat in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze user are sign up for carpooling, it' signific that their number have reportedli swell from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentag of thi grow number of peopl goe for it, it can still be a compel number.Taxi Servic Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere' no doubt about it, these two compani have been grow in leap and bound as the conveni and qualiti of servic have attract more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhap cheaper (becaus a self-driv car doesn't need a driver) servic come onlin certainli isn't good news.Googl wa an initi investor in Uber, but when the compani start develop self-driv technolog to save it neck, Googl repres David Drummond remov himself from it board. Uber still use Googl map services, but ha increas invest to develop map of it own.ConclusionUb and it pal have popular the concept of ride-hailing/car-shar servic but now that the concept ha caught on, there will be new entrants. Thi is a big opportun for car maker becaus thi is the space where new car will be deploy in the future.On the technolog side, there is the need for machin learn and cloud support, map technology, and sensors, which have to be instal on car built to hous the technology. And that' exactli whi compani like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Fre Report) are tie up with compani like Mobileye, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Fre Report) pair up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU-Fre Report) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Fre Report). Then of cours there' Google. These compani are in turn test the technolog through collabor agreement with automakers.But who will get there first? Industri watcher don't expect anyth viabl until 2020. Even if it' a coupl of year out from there, it doe look like there will be more than one approach/technolog drive the experience. And sinc the possibl are tremendous, there won't necessarili be a singl winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

Microsoft Wants Tech Industry to Tackle $3 Trillion Problem,2/24/2017,"Cybercrim ha impact everyon from individu who have been hack or had their credit card compromis to the countless busi hit by larg scale breaches. Digit secur doe not even stop at the compani level as we saw in the recent Unit Stateselection.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Presid and Chief Legal Offic Brad Smith believ that the tech industri ha both the abil and respons to work togeth on protect the world from digit attacks/cybercrime. In a piec post on aMicrosoft blogin advanc of the annual RSA Conference, which bring togeth secur profession from around the world, he laid out hi case for what he call a Digit Geneva Convent -- a commit by the technolog industri to collect work across border to keep the world safe from digit crime.""Just as the Fourth Geneva Convent recogn that the protect of civilian requir the activ involv of the Red Cross, protect against nation-st cyberattack requir the activ assist of technolog companies,"" he wrote. ""The tech sector play a uniqu role as the internet' first responders, and we therefor should commit ourselv to collect action that will make the internet a safer place, affirm a role as a neutral Digit Switzerland that assist custom everywher and retain the world' trust.""makeArticleAd();It' a bold idea that would sometim forc compani to work against self-interest. For example, one pillar of Smith' propos Digit Geneva Convent call for compani to ""report vulner to vendor rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them."" That may not be easi to get industrywid cooper on, but Smith lay out a case that the need is veri strong.Cyb secur ha becom a global problem. Imag source: Getti Images.How big is the problem?Nearli three quarter (74%) of the world' busi expect a cyberattack in 2016 with the econom impact of cybercrim expect to reach $3 trillion by 2020, Smith wrote. What' worse, the Microsoft execut said, is that crime are not just be carri out by rogu element or even unscrupul businesses, they are now increasingli be carri out by nations.""TheSony(NYSE: SNE) attack by North Korea in 2014 wa not the first nation-st attack, but it repres a visibl turn point,"" he wrote. ""While prior attack had focus on econom and militari espionage, the Soni attack in 2014 involv retali for free express in the form of a (not veri popular) movie.""That breach and subsequ releas of data wa follow in 2015 by ""even more visibl intern discuss about nation-st attack aim at the theft of companies' intellectu property,"" wrote Smith. In 2016, he added, the issu ""broaden again to includ hack incid connect to the democrat process itself.""What doe Microsoft want done?Smith call on the world' govern to come together. He want them to agre on ""intern cybersecur norm that have emerg in recent years, adopt new and bind rule and get to work implement them."" That' a bold ask given how hard it is to get consensu on anyth on a global or at least near-glob level. The Microsoft execut break it down into six major points:No target of tech companies, privat sector, or critic infrastructureAssist privat sector effort to detect, contain, respond to, and recov from eventsReport vulner to vendor rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit themExercis restraint in develop cyber weapon and ensur that ani develop are limited, precise, and not reusableCommit to nonprolifer activ to cyber weaponsLimit offens oper to avoid a mass eventY can see that thi list is realli just a bare bone guideline. Restraint, for example, can mean differ thing to differ people. Still, what Smith and Microsoft are propos would be a bold effort to engag the privat sector in respond to nation-st cyber attack while also creat a framework for how govern agre to use their own offens digit attack abilities.Whi is thi import to Microsoft?Govern cannot battl cybercrim effect without help from the privat sector. Rogu nation howev can do great damag with cyber attacks.Th Soni situat with North Korea involv a countri use digit stolen materi to lash back at a busi over the content of a movie. It wa an event that show that everi compani is vulner whether it be through the releas of privat communications, the theft of intellectu property, or even the corrupt of softwar or hardwar to do thing it' not suppos to do (like spi on people, record data includ credit card numbers, or pretti much ani other dastardli thing you can think of).Becaus cyberspac is intangible, it' not as easili govern as the real world. Differ rule need to be creat and that requir a much broader consensu between nations. Go forward howev Microsoft is right that a new level of cooper is requir between both rival compani and the govern of the world.Cybercrime, hacks, and digit attack can potenti not onli crippl businesses, but in theori chang the fate of nations. How the technolog commun and nation work in fight that togeth ha to be work out and ground rule creat befor the next disast strikes.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving Technology,2/23/2017,"When ask some time back about the use case for self-driv cars, AlphabetGOOGLexecut said that they were explor alternatives. Thing have chang somewhat sinc then and we have slightli greater clariti on whether Googl will maintain it own fleet, rent out for deliveri of goods, food and/or passeng transport, or whether it will rent vehicl from their maker and sell those servic itself.Mi bet wa alway on the latter, first becaus Googl is primarili a technolog compani and thrive on make the kind of softwar that can take over our lives. Get into the low-margin busi of vehicl mainten and rent just isn't it area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of invest that is go into get these anim on the road isn't justifi unless there is a lucr busi out there with a rel quick payback time.So the company' initi step toward commerci by get key peopl on board and announc the name of the unit as Waymo wa heartening. The goal of thi unit is to develop self-driv technolog for car makers.How Doe All Thi Tie In with the Waze Carpool Service?Waz wa an Isra crowd-sourc map servic provid user with inform such as traffic, road condit and other help pointers, so they could quickli decid their route. At least that' what it wa in 2013 when Googl acquir it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpool servic that get peopl travel in the same direct to travel togeth and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headach to avail the servic like have to book way in advanc or not have anybodi to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyon to becom a driver, so they can't make a live from it.Al thi goe to show that Google' plan in the area probabl aren't crystal and the servic is a temporari measur to access that all-import thing these day call data. Data that can add to the treasur trove Google' alreadi collect through the test drive of it self-driv cars.Th difficulti don't seem to have deter users, however, becaus Googl just announc the expans of the servic to unannounc locat in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze user are sign up for carpooling, it' signific that their number have reportedli swell from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentag of thi grow number of peopl goe for it, it can still be a compel number.Taxi Servic Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere' no doubt about it, these two compani have been grow in leap and bound as the conveni and qualiti of servic have attract more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhap cheaper (becaus a self-driv car doesn't need a driver) servic come onlin certainli isn't good news.Googl wa an initi investor in Uber, but when the compani start develop self-driv technolog to save it neck, Googl repres David Drummond remov himself from it board. Uber still use Googl map services, but ha increas invest to develop map of it own.ConclusionUb and it pal have popular the concept of ride-hailing/car-shar servic but now that the concept ha caught on, there will be new entrants. Thi is a big opportun for car maker becaus thi is the space where new car will be deploy in the future.On the technolog side, there is the need for machin learn and cloud support, map technology, and sensors, which have to be instal on car built to hous the technology. And that' exactli whi compani like IntelINTCar tie up with compani like Mobileye, while NVIDIANVDApair up with BaiduBIDUand MicrosoftMSFT. Then of cours there' Google.

Why Nokia Corp (NOK) Stock Should Make a BIG Comeback Soon,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) announc it fourth-quart result on Feb. 2 and it exceed analysts' expectations. NOK' oper profit drop by 27% from the prior-year quarter to 940 million euros, or $1 billion. Analyst poll byReuterswer expect profit of 788 million euro for Nokia stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Schedul / Grid Engin via Flickr (Modified)Given the better-than-expect results, analyst at Morgan Stanley, led by Francoi Meunier upgrad Nokia stock to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight,"" with a new price target of €5.70. Meunier particularli like how NOK stock is improv it margins.In addit to improv margins, I believ Nokia' return to the smartphon market should also bring optimism.NOK-Brand Smartphon Come Back to the MarketTh stori of Nokia' last ten year or so ha been all about how the smartphon revolut swept the compani into oblivion. It eventu sold it phone busi toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which eventu sold it to Foxconn and HMD Global in 2016.Follow the transfer of phone assets, HMD Global launch the Nokia 6 smartphon in China in Januari of thi year. Accord to reports, the smartphon is be bought so quickli that it creat an impress that HMD Global wa onli do flash sales. HMD Global hadto clarifythat quick sellout were the reason it appear as though it ha been a flash sale.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowHMD is expect to announc a few more Android-run Nokia phone at the Mobil World Congress in Barcelona later thi month. Accord to reports, HMD will be announc the Nokia P1 and two Nokia D1C smartphon at the event. We expect the Nokia P1 to be a high-end smartphone, with Nokia stockhint at usingitsWeibo Corp (ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) account that an Android-pow Nokia phone with the Snapdragon 835 SoC is in the works.Oth report claim that the P1 phone will sport a 22.6 megapixel camera and IP68 water and dust resistance. It price would rang between $779 and $900, depend on the storag size.On the other hand, one of the Nokia D1C smartphoneswil be a mid-rang smartphone, sport the Snapdragon 430 SoC, 3GB RAM and a 16-megapixel rear-fac camera, accord to reports. It' expect to cost around $200. The other D1C smartphon is expect to be of lower spec with 2GB RAM and a 13-megapixel rear-fac camera.I decid to give a rundown of what' expect to point out that Nokia stock and it license are target everi segment of the smartphon market with their pipeline. The P1 will compet at the high-end of the market; one of the D1C' will compet at the mid-level market, while the other D1C will compet for low-end customers.I believ that thi multi-prong approach increas the chanc that NOK stock will be somewhat relev in the smartphon market - at least one of the consum segment should find it phone attractive.I'm particularli optimist about the low-end D1C smartphone. Variousreview about afford brand smartphoneshav carrier-lock iPhon 5s as the most afford smartphon around. And that price is mostli limit to the U.S. Unlock version cost more. So in essence, by the time the low-end Nokia D1C get to the market, it would be just about the most afford brand smartphon there is.Bottom Line on Nokia StockWith such an offer, I see an opportun for NOK stock to captur the ""unbranded"" smartphon market. Higher afford is a common featur of unbrand smartphon phones. With the low-end D1C, Nokia will be offer custom who have been deter by high price an opportun to own brand phone at an afford price.2 Reason Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More EnticingTh seemingli high demand for Nokia 6, which launch for 1699 Chines Yuan (roughli $247) in China, is proof that lower-end NOK stock phone stand a chance.But, it should be note that the compani would onli receiv royalti payment on everi sale of Nokia brand products. In other words, onli a portion of the money these phone gener will end up in NOK' books.Still, thi is high-margin revenu sinc the license bear the product cost and it will go some way to help Nokia stock fix it worsen revenu problem over the long-term.Overall, while I believ that NOK stock is on the right way to recovery. However, Nokia stock isn't for the faint-hearted. Although the reward could be great for long-term investor with a high risk-tak quotient.A of thi writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Consum Stock That Will Knock Your Sock Off7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeTh postWhi Nokia Corp (NOK) Stock Should Make a BIG Comeback Soonappear first onInvestorPlace."

Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?,2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI stumbl across a predict last week that would impress even Mad Money' Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();Accord to a recent report from Oxfam, an intern charit organization, Bill Gate ha a shot at becom the world' first trillionaire. Oxfam specul that if the return on the tech mogul' $75 billion fortun in the next 25 year are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gate ha a shot at jump the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man ha a shot at becom a trillionaire, certainli one of theS&P 500′ biggest compani ha a shot at becom the world' first $1 trillion company?Turn out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 compani with a shot at break the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest compani on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook' share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) ha a market cap of $400 billion. Share would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) ha a market cap of $498 billion. Share would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is current worth $570 billion. Share would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believ everi one of these compani will eventu be worth $1 trillion. However, one other compani will beat them all to it.Thank to a varieti of factors,Appl Inc.(AAPL) is set to becom the first $1 trillion compani in the world in the next five years.Th compani ha been on a roll. After beat fourth-quart earn by 4%, share just hit a new all-tim high abov $135.That give Appl a market cap of $710 billion, make it the largest compani in the S&P 500. It ha also place Appl within strike distanc of the $1 trillion mark. Share of Appl would onli need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If it current valuat stay the same, Appl would need to grow earn by 8% annual in the next five year to hit that target. As it stands, Appl is expect to grow earn by 8% thi year and anoth 13% in 2018. Those two year alon get Appl almost half way to 50% earn growth.But even if Apple' earn grow slower than expected, it ha an ace up it sleeve.Appl Ha $246 Billion In Cash On It Balanc SheetApple' cash posit is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quart results, Apple' report a cash posit of $246 billion. Some of that cash is alreadi account for in Apple' $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Us as littl as half of it cash balanc to repurchas share add anoth $125 billion to Apple' market cap.Apple' Is One Of The Most Undervalu Stock In The S&P 500Appl is one of the most undervalu stock in the S&P 500. It forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500 20. That lower valuat exist despit the fact that Appl is project to grow earn faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Techn speak that mean Appl should be trade with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Appl trade with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, share would share would climb 25%, give Appl a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Invest In AppleApple' pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold ha attract the attent of the world' greatest investor. In recent regulatori filings, Berkshir reveal it had quadrupl it ownership in Appl to 57 million shares. Buffett' stake wa worth approxim $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With share of Appl alreadi up 17% on the year, Buffett ha pocket a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveRisk To Consider:Appl ha struggl to launch new hit in the last few years. Although sale growth in it most import product the iPhon is still strong, Appl isn't the innov compani it wa under Steve Jobs.Act To Take:Appl is on pace to becom the world' first $1 trillion company.

Chime' app work on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchron across all platform via Amazon Web Servic (AWS).Chim come in three version -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voic and video call and chat; Chime Plus, which add screen share and the integr of compani directories; and Chime Pro, which add tool for scheduling, hosting, recording, and person meet for up to 100 people.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Thes featur indic that Amazon is take aim at collabor tool likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rival alreadi too deepli entrench in the enterpris market for Amazon to disrupt? Let' take a closer look at Amazon' game plan to find out.Ent the crowd Saa marketAmazon' AWS, which ha an annual run rate of $14 billion, is the biggest cloud infrastructur platform in the world. It' sever time larger than it closest competitor, Microsoft' Azure. But while AW domin the cloud platform (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which host storag space, process power, and other tool for compani and develop -- it doesn't have a major presenc in the Saa (softwar as a service) market yet.Th Saa market is the crowded, consumer-fac side of the cloud, which includ servic like Microsoft' Offic 365, Dynam CRM, and Skype. The lion' share of Microsoft' commerci cloud revenu run rate of $14 billion is gener by those Saa product instead of Azure. Microsoft ha also been expand Skype' capabl as an enterpris collabor tool with Microsoft Teams, which enhanc Skype' cloud-bas commun featur and tightli integr the servic into Offic 365.Microsoft Teams. Imag source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, network giant Cisco aggress bundl softwar and secur product with it routers, switches, and unifi comput systems. Those bundl includ collabor tool like Spark, the cloud-bas platform for messages, meetings, and call it launch in late 2015. Last quarter, Cisco' collabor revenu rose 4% annual to $1.06 billion -- make it it third largest busi after it core busi of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the onli player in the crowd field of cloud-bas collabor tools.Alphabet' Googl ha been promot Hangout to enterpris custom over the past year,Boxha ad collabor tool on top of it cloud storag platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix' GoToMeet video conferenc platform for the same purposes. However, all these challeng notabl lack Microsoft and Cisco' clout in the enterpris market.That' whi Amazon believ it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also ha leverag -- the grow import of AW to enterpris customers. Amazon like believ that by offer Chime as an extens of AW (especi with it 30-day free trial) to it enterpris custom base, it can gain a foothold in the crowd ""unifi communication"" platform market.Amazon previous launch enterpris Saa product like WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever releas offici growth figur for those products. However, most industri watcher believ that those product are still dwarf by compar solut from Microsoft and Cisco. Thi strongli indic that AWS' domin of the PaaS/Iaa market doesn't guarante that Chime will becom a Skype or Spark killer anytim soon. Chime Pro also cost more than Skype for Busi -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plan to undercut it way into the market.Th key takeawayChim sound like a logic way for AW to straddl the PaaS/Iaa and Saa markets, but it' easier said than done. The market for cloud-bas unifi commun platform is incred crowded, and it' doubt that a new servic -- even one bundl with AW -- can claim a meaning slice of the market. However, Amazon investor should still keep an eye out for futur Saa product to see if the compani can eventu challeng heavyweight like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple to Begin Assembling iPhone SE in India from April,2/17/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Appl Inc.AAPLin collabor with it manufacturer, Wistron Inc. will begin to assembl iPhon SE in India start thi April. The plant will be locat in the state of Karnataka in south India.Though there is no offici word on the matter from Appl or Wistron, it ha been report that initi the Cupertino giant want to assembl 0.3-0.4 million unit of iPhon SE. Appl hasn't even wait for the numer tax concess that it sought from the India govern includ the 15-year custom duti holiday.Analyst observ that it wa prudent on part of Appl to begin assembl it most econom iPhon offering, SE, which wa launch to cater to cost sensit market like India. Plus, it also will support futur iO upgrad unlik iPhon 5S, which will soon be discontinu in most of the market includ India.Appl Inc. PriceAppl Inc. Price|Appl Inc. QuoteWhi is Appl Keen on India?Sinc the last year, Appl ha been increas it focu on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphon market, of which it reportedli hold onli 2% as of now. Appl face slow iPhon demand in most of the regions, either becaus of competit or regulatori hurdl (China) or market satur (the U.S). Therefore, it make sens for the compani to solidifi it posit in India, which is project to becom the second largest smartphon market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Appl sale in India grew approxim 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) popul and increas invest in broadband network by the govern also make India an attract growth opportun for Appl over the long run. In fact, the govern under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capit and boost manufactur facil in India.Th recent outlin FDI polici also bode well for the compani as it elimin the requir to local sourc product for at least a three-year period. Thi will enabl Appl to open it solely-own retail store in India. Thereafter, the compani will have to compli with the rule. The compani ha also partner with telecom compani Reliance, which is provid it Jio (a uniqu all-IP network) servic for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook wa on a charm offens in India. Besid meet Modi, he also announc the open of an iO App Design and Develop Acceler in Bengaluru and a map develop offic in anoth southern Indian city, Hyderabad in collabor with region firm RMSI.ChallengesTh market is highli cost sensitive. Reportedly, major of the smartphon sold are price around INR 10K (roughli $145). iPhon 7 on the other hand cost almost five time more. Even iPhon SE is price at INR 30K. The lion' share of Apple' revenu in the countri come from devices, which are a coupl of gener old. Newer model have rel low demand given the hefti price tag. A few day back, it wa report that the Appl team in India is tri to increas revenu to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembl operations, the compani can start to oper it own retail outlet and avail a 10% tax benefit. Thi should lower prices.Plus, Apple' rival Samsung along with a few Chines smartphon maker domin thi market. Samsung ha long been in the market and with reportedli 23% share, it is a lead player in the country. Appl is quit late to the party.Also, Apple' lack of focu on region customers' demand is a concern. India is categor by handset that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Appl is not keen on make dual SIM handsets. Thi could be a veri big impedi to growth in the country.Also, analyst observ that Appl is ""relocating"" manufactur to India from China, given rise labor costs. Howev anoth analyst argu that though labor is cheap compar with China, product is rel better in China. Simpl assembl may not drastic bring down prices. However, the creation of a local suppli chain as in China will be a big positive.Despit the pro and cons, Appl is expect to continu it India drive. It will be take up a lot more initi thi year. However, whether those initi yield desir result remain a watch and see story.Apple, of course, is not the onli tech player eye India for growth.

Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Oracle Corporation,2/17/2017,"Co-found and Chief Technolog Offic Larri Ellison describesOracle(NYSE: ORCL) as a cloud leader to be reckon with, and he may be right -- eventually. But today it'sMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) at the top of the cloud heap. But Oracle' late start -- thank to Ellison' earli dismiss of cloud comput as noth more than ""the latest fashion"" -- could work in investors' favor becaus it translat to tremend upsid from here.Meanwhile, Microsoft' decis to name Satya Nadella as CEO three year ago ha proven to be an absolut game changer. Microsoft' stock wa meander under former chief Steve Ballmer, but no longer. Nadella ha chang Microsoft' busi focu as well as it cultur -- and it' working.So which stock is the better buy? Let' take a look.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Oracle.Th case for OracleOracle' fiscal second quarter (end Nov. 30) wa one to rememb as it relat to cloud results. For the first time, Oracle' combin cloud Platform-as-a-Servic (PaaS), Software-as-a-Servic (SaaS), and infrastructur revenu top the $1 billion mark. Paa and Saa revenu climb 81% last quarter to $878 million.Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Servic (IaaS) couldn't match the growth rate of Oracle' skyrocket Saa and Paa results, but it revenu still climb 6% to $175 million, bring total cloud sale to $1.05 billion, equal to 12% of Oracle' $9 billion in total revenu last quarter. For some perspective, a year ago Oracl report $649 million in cloud revenue, which equal just 7% of it $8.99 billion in total sales.Oracl ha quickli becom a softwar vendor of note outsid the cloud, too. It legaci hardwar and relat support sale of $1 billion notch a 10% declin from a year ago, which can be attribut to Oracle' shift to up-and-com opportun along with the inevit slow of ""old-school"" enterpris hardwar markets.Though softwar and licens sale declin 4% last quarter, when combin with cloud revenu -- an Oracl earn report stapl nowaday -- the $7.2 billion wa a 2% year-over-year improvement. Better still, and someth worth watch for when Oracl report estim third-quart earn on March 13, is that combin cloud and softwar revenu now account for 80% of all sales, up from 78% a year ago.Imag source: Microsoft.Th case for MicrosoftSimilar to Oracle, Microsoft' cloud result are center on SaaS. Accord toGartner, overal Saa cloud revenu jump $36 billion to $144 billion in 2016. Saa is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 37% through 2020, and Microsoft is lead the charge. The onli cloud segment expect to grow faster than Saa are busi process sales, at 43% per year, which is anoth key to Microsoft' stellar results.Last quarter, Microsoft' cloud annual revenu run rate wa more than $14 billion, led by commerci Offic 365 sales, it Azur platform, and Dynam CRM. Azure, which is Microsoft' Paa for deliv cloud solutions, soar 93%. Despit it rapid cloud growth, Microsoft is control costs.Tot revenu increas just 1.2% last quarter to $24 billion, but net incom grew nearli 4% to $5.2 billion. With about 200 million fewer share outstand and the compani manag expenses, Microsoft' $0.66-per-shar earn wa a 6.5% increase, and that includ a neg $0.01 hit from the LinkedIn acquisition.So, which is the better buy?In addit to be further along in it cloud transit than Oracle, Microsoft ha multipl revenu driver includ the LinkedIn asset and the data that come with it. And Microsoft is lead the race to domin augment realiti (AR), a market expect to gener $83 billion by 2021 compar to virtual reality' (VR) $25 billion.Oracl is on the right path, and it 1.5% dividend yield is respectable. However, consid Microsoft' cloud and AR leadership positions, a dividend yield of 2.5%, data analyt driven by artifici intellig (AI), Bing search, and OS leadership positions, it all add up to Microsoft as the better buy.10 stock we like better than OracleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ServiceNow' 2016 sale explod 38% to $1.4 billion, and it ha laid claim to be the ""fastest-grow enterpris softwar compani with more than $1 billion in revenue.""[ibdchart symbol=""NOW"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""leftchart"" ]It ha set big goals, too. The Santa Clara, Calif.-bas compani plan to nearli tripl it revenu to $4 billion by 2020.makeArticleAd();""There' not anoth compani that produc growth at our scale like we do,"" Frank Slootman, ServiceNow' chief executive, said in an interview. ""It' a trifecta - scale, growth and free cash flow.""ServiceNow face fierc competition, though, most notabl fromSalesforce.com(CRM), current the market leader in the industri known as SaaS. Salesforce.com' 2016 sale boom 24% to $6.7 billion, and the San Francisco-bas compani is on track to hit $10 billion in revenu for the current fiscal year. It' aim to hit $20 billion after that.Salesforce.com ha the higher profile, be oft-ment in industri merger activity, whether it involvesMicrosoft(MSFT), LinkedIn,Twitter(TWTR) or anoth company. It special in softwar that help busi organ and handl sale operations.But ServiceNow stock ha shot up 25% in 2017, while Salesforce.com is up 18% after lag last year.How It WorksSaa compani sell onlin subscript to software, rather than one-tim licenses. Saa provid have high custom renew rate and book recur revenu over the long term. Most sell into the so-cal ""enterpris market"" - larg companies, govern agenc and other big customers.ServiceNow ha prosper by take away the custom of BMC Software,Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE),CA Technologies(CA) and other ""on-premise"" softwar provid that shift slowli to cloud-bas Saa busi models.Found in 2004, ServiceNow develop softwar for inform technolog servic management, basic IT help-desk tool for track intern compani issues. As Salesforce.com ha expand into marketing, custom servic and e-commerce, ServiceNow ha made a similar push into customer-servic tools, heighten the rivalri between the two.Salesforce.com ha been an acquisit machine, spend more than $4.6 billion in 2016 alon to buy companies.In ServiceNow' case, though, it can hit it $4 billion target by grow ""organically,"" mean without big acquisitions, say Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst.""Ther may be opportun for them to enhanc the breadth of their offer with (small) tuck-in acquisitions,"" Zukin added.New MarketsServiceNow expect to reach it $4 billion revenu goal by expand into new market - human resources, custom servic manag and security, to name a few - and by land bigger contract while target the top 2,000 global companies.ServiceNow ha bought small compani like Neebula Systems, iTapp and most recent DxContinuum to acquir ""talent and technology,"" said Slootman, who ha been ServiceNow' CEO sinc 2011. He earlier head Data Domain, which wa sold to data storag network giant EMC in 2009.""Technolog is not as use without the talent,"" Slootman said. ""We have the abil to sell, so I don't need to acquir revenu or customers. We can do that ourselves. We tri to acquir small compani with promis technolog befor they go vertic and their revenu explodes, becaus then it' way more expens (to acquir them).""ServiceNow still garner most revenu from servic management, but the 2014 Neebula acquisit provid key technolog for map a customers' IT infrastructur in case outag or other problem occur. That' a differ market, call IT oper management. ServiceNow' 2016 purchas of ITApp provid cloud manag tools.ServiceNow' oper manag tool account for about 9% of subscript revenue, with that expect to grow to at least 15% by 2020.Common GroundSlootman say the same softwar tool that autom information-technolog workflow and record keep can be appli for finance, legal, procur and other corpor departments. Like Salesforce.com, ServiceNow is build a librari of busi app that custom can download via the internet.Th name of the game for mani Saa compani is build a cloud ""platform"" so they can sell multipl softwar tool to differ industries.IBD' TAKE:Aft a seri offlat basesov the last 10 months, ServiceNow broke out last month and is stake out higher ground abov the 90 level.

Why Connected Cars Are a Big Deal for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud Business,2/16/2017,"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is make a big move in the automot space without make ani car of it own. The Redmond, Wash. compani ha decid that it won't be join the race to develop it own cars, like mani of it peers. Instead, Microsoft want to becom the racetrack itself.Microsoft' automot moveAt CE 2017, Microsoft announc the launch of the Connect Vehicl Platform base on Azur in a bid to becom the cornerston of the connect and autom car revolution. Thi platform will focu on five key thing the car of tomorrow need -- advanc navigation, predict maintenance, better in-car productivity, custom inputs, and finally, enabl autonom driving.Imag source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();Accord to a blog post by Microsoft Execut VP of Busi Develop Peggi Johnson:Microsoft' cloud will do the heavi lift by ingest huge volum of sensor and usag data from connect vehicles, and then help automak appli that data in power ways.Microsoft, therefore, is take the smart approach of becom the enabl of connect and autom cars. Such an approach avoid the need for deliv ani sort of packag product to automakers. The connect vehicl platform will use artifici intellig (AI) base on data provid by vehicl and driver in real time.In fact, the compani ha been shore up it AI capabl in order to develop it automot platform. Last month, it announc the acquisit of Canadian AI compani Maluuba for an undisclos amount. Maluuba use deep learn and neural network to creat independ machin that can ""think, reason, and commun like humans."" Microsoft can use these trait to enhanc the data process and decision-mak capabl of it own technology.Additionally, Microsoft will power the in-car product of car by equip automak with it key products, such as Offic 365, Cortana, and Skype for Business. Thi focu on offer a cloud platform with advanc comput and product to automot client should help it win a lot of busi in thi space.Th opportun in automot data process and storageComput softwar provid Tuxera believ a new car in 2017 will gener 20 GB of data daili if it is driven for just two hours. Thi amount of data will come from just 16 sensor and two cameras, and these car are far from be fulli autonomous. By comparison, futur car with enhanc self-driv capabl are expect to have at least 20 comput on board to process the data captur by cameras.In fact, an autonom vehicl is expect to gener 10 GB of data each second, which will increas as more sensor are added. Thi present the need for a central infrastructur to share the process workload. Thi way, the vehicl can collect data and priorit action that have to be execut in real time and upload the rest to a data center for further process and analysis.Microsoft want to becom thi data center with it connect vehicl platform. The compani ha even equip the Azur cloud platform withNVIDIA' Quadro profession graphic card. As a result, Azur can now offer supercomputing-class perform to it custom for high-perform applications, indic that it is prepar to process the huge amount of data connect car will generate.What connect car mean for Microsoft' businessMicrosoft is on the right track as it ha alreadi won contract with key automakers. TheRenault-Nissanalli is one of the first adopt of the connect vehicl platform as it plan to put 10 autonom car on the road by 2020 use Microsoft' cloud.Investor should also note that car maker aren't the onli one util the Azur connect cloud platform. Reinsur provid Swiss Re, for example, is explor the use of the Azur cloud to collect and analyz telemat data to creat specif insur packag for custom base on drive behavior. Similarly, geograph inform system provid Esri ha also sign up to use the Azur cloud to provid analyt and data to the driver of a car.A growing, diversifi client base can boost the company' cloud busi in the long run, which is alreadi grow at a faster-than-expect pace. When Microsoft releas it second quarter results, it cloud revenu grew 10% year over year to $6.9 billion, outperform analyst expectations.Th company' cloud growth wa driven by a 93% jump in revenu from Azur as Microsoft saw the platform' usag by client doubl on a year-over-year basis. An increas in the adopt of Microsoft' connect vehicl servic over time will lead to win for the Azur platform as data need inevit grow.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(ATTU) provid softwar to enterpris use to replic and integr heterogen data sourc into a singl data lake, which provid the basi for creat data warehous use for Big Data analysis. The compani ha been in exist for 20 years, first provid softwar use to integr mainfram data and then ad more data sourc as they becam avail in the market. Current data sourc includ Oracl (Oracle), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Amazon Redshift (AMZN), Teradata (TDC), Hadoop, and modern stream data sources. The compani ha OEM relationship with Microsoft and Amazon where the compani emb Attunity' solut into their own when data replic is call for.Attunity' revenu grew quickli in the 2014-2015 time frame, with 43% growth in 2014 and 36% growth in 2015. Thi growth wa driven by the need to gather data from variou corpor sourc and assembl it into data warehous for analysis. Attun ha a simpl but power solut that enabl a much faster time to analysi for it customers. Attun is admittedli a smaller player in the market face bigger competit in Informatica (INFA) and IBM (IBM), but it solut is robust and ha proven success for it custom base. In 2014 and 2015, Attun mostli sold into smaller opportun of $1 million or less with six to nine month sale cycles. By 2016, Attunity' success and increas name recognit began to attract larger deal with longer sale cycl and differ sale team requirements. The compani found that some of it sale forc wa not up to the task and revenu onli grew 11% as some larg deal slip dure the year.makeArticleAd();Attun manag acknowledg the problem and swap out 15 of it weaker sale hand and replac them with more experienc enterpris softwar sale people. Our work suggest that the company' problem in 2016 wa inde company-specif as the market for it type of softwar remain robust. Manag is convinc that the worst of it sale issu are behind it and thi wa born out by a beat and rais Decemb quarter. The compani notch sale of $15.6 million versu expect of $14.3 million. Guidanc for 2017 wa set at $62-65 million, abov consensu of $60 million.W believ that after the company' tough 2016, manag is guid more conserv for 2017 than it did last year. The market seem to be support of growth rate seen in 2014 and 2015, yet neither the manag team nor the analyst want to get ahead of themselv at thi point. Given the veri high gross margin in thi busi (90%), there is a ton of oper leverag onc revenu get moving. Manag guid to 5-8% oper margin in 2017 but these could go much higher, especi in 2018, if revenu ramp ahead of plan.W valu ATTU on an enterpris valu to revenu basi base on 2018 numbers. Base on our current 2018 revenu forecast, ATTU trade at 1.6x revenue. We believ it should trade at a substanti higher multipl of 3x. The closest public comp, Talend SA (TLND) trade at 4x 2018 number and oper in essenti the same market. At 3x, ATTU would be worth $14.72, or 84% higher than it current trade price.In term of an endgame, Attun could grow organ for an extend period in thi larg market, but it could also present an interest acquisit target for a larger strateg or financi player. The CEO, Shimon Alon, is the largest sharehold with 8% of the stock, so he ha a consider financi interest in the company' future. Interestingli Microsoft, as an OEM partner, ha right of first refus for ani acquisit propos by anoth party. Thi demonstr the import of ATTU to Microsoft and presum to it other OEM partner.Attun is a bit of a relic in it perpetu licens revenu model. While most softwar compani today are in the Software-as-a-Servic ((SAAS)) model, Attunity' custom base demand ownership of it softwar products, so it sell to them in a perpetu fashion. Thi busi model is a two-edg sword as revenu above/below forecast drop to the bottom line and caus larg EP beats/misses. The main risk for Attun is that some deal slip out of a quarter caus a revenu and earn shortfall.Se alsoBuffett Flee Wal-Mart: Begin Of The End For The Giant Retailer?on seekingalpha.com"

AAPL stock would get an automat 10% to 15% bump in the day that followed. CouldMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) have a similarli secret catalyst in it so-cal Window Cloud product?makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Window Cloud is a mysteri oper system that wa reveal via leaks, prompt a ""noth to share"" respons from Microsoft last week.What Is the Window Cloud?A coupl websit post screen shot of Microsoft' yet-to-be-announc oper system, which would onli run Window Store app design to run on both desktop comput and mobil devices. The thought is that the Window Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company' Window 10 platform, which is onli 18 month old.Th Window Cloud is alreadi be view as Microsoft' answer toAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome OS. And by util onli it own apps, the platform could have a secur advantag over Chrome, which use non-n apps. That could posit Window 10 as a more appeal option to public institut like schools, where protect students' comput from outsid app or game can be difficult.Not much els is known about the Window Cloud platform. And that' probabl how Microsoft like it. Although Wall Street didn't immedi embrac the top-secret new product by snatch up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the compani actual doe it big Window Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-lik effect on Microsoft stock?7 Dividend Stock Reward Sharehold With a RaiseClick to EnlargeFirst, let' look at how MSFT stock ha been behav lately.Ther wa big spike in MSFT stock last month ha sinc been follow by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hover abov it 25- and 50-day move averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.What you don't see is ani kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the day sinc the Window Cloud leak occurred. That mean investor aren't quit sure exactli what the Window Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT' business, which is whi there ha been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.If more detail leak out, that could potenti move the needle. For now, though, the Window Cloud remain a rel mysteri that like ha Wall Street more confus than excited.MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'In the meantime, Microsoft look good on it own merits. MSFT stock is up nearli 30% in the last year, nearli 50% in the last two years, still trade at less than 20 time forward earn estimates, and is expect to grow earnings-per-shar by more than 6% thi year and more than 9% next year.

"Should I Buy Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA few year ago,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) seem like a sure bet. Hey, with it CDMA platform, the compani wa at the heart of the fast-grow mobil market. QCOM stock wa essenti a cash machine.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet late the compani ha been in a slump. Sinc the summer of 2014, QCOM stock ha lost about a third of it value. Of course, the tech industri is chock-ful of exampl of darl that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when thi happens, the gain can certainli be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% dure the past coupl years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upsid or should investor remain wary? Let' take a look at three pro and three con and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobil Powerhouse:Th root of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engin team up to capit on the mobil industry. At first they focus on technolog to provid location-bas servic and messag for the truck industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, call CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.Th busi model wa to licens the technology, which would mean get aggress with patents. While success wa not immediate, QCOM wa determin to make CDMA a critic part of the mobil industry. And of course, thi wager ultim paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM' marque custom includeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteMegatrends:Th mobil market is expect to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continu demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are current about 4 billion 3G/4G connect use CMDA system and thi is expect to increas to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substanti benefit from the emerg of 5G technologies. These will allow for better perform for the Internet of Thing (IoT), wearables, autonom vehicles, virtual realiti and even remot medic procedures. While QCOM' R&D invest will be vital for capit on these trends, the compani ha also ramp up it deal-making. No doubt, the most notabl exampl of thi isth propos $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductor NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the compani is one of the top player in the fast-grow market for self-driv cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM' revenu are not grow at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there wa a4% increase. But then again, the compani is fairli mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remain a highli profit business, with fiscal 2016 net incom come to$6.7 billion. The compani ha also been sharehold friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attract 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Becaus of the extens patent portfolio, QCOM collect a hefti royalti from most sale of smartphon across the globe - even for those devic that do not even includ ani of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chines governmentchalleng QCOM' practices, and the case wa eventu settled.But there are other major case that are in the earli stages, such as in South Korea, Europ and the U.S. Oh, and Appl ha also launchedsever major lawsuit against QCOM. The compani certainli ha tremend resourc to wage a brutal fight. Now as with ani legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultim loses, then it core busi model will be in jeopardi and thi could certainli have horrend consequences. Keep in mind that the compani get about80% of it pretax profit from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president' agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump consid a currenc manipulator. He ha also call for stiff tariff and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is like to be advers to U.S.-bas compani that deriv substanti revenu from China. Let' face it, the govern is crack down, favor domestic-bas oper over foreign ones. All in all, thi pose materi risk for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescom from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rival includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexa Instrument Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a varieti of startup that are gun for the mobil market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultim be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel enter an agreement with Appl to suppli chips. Befor this, QCOM wa thesol supplier.In other words, if the legal battl go against the company, Intel may be in a better posit to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuat is definit attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn multipl is onli about 11.5X.3 Reason Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Head to ZeroBut thi may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litig is far from clear - and of course, legal disput often move at a glacial pace. So in light of this, it' probabl best to avoid QCOM stock for now.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand also ha hi own free iO app to estim your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

"Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) ha certainli made a tremend comeback sinc 2008, after have to declar bankruptcy. But there ha been littl for investor to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the compani pull off it IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at onli $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliv via Flickr (Modified)To put thing into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn ha noted: ""Ever sinc the 2008 crash and govern bailout, Gener Motor stock ha been treat like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actual think thi is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventu investor will recogn the value. Hey, thi ha happen with other stock that languish for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investor hold off? Well, to see, let' take a look at 3 pro and con on Gener Motors:3 Pro On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, Gener Motor ha post record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenu increas by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flow came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previou year.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteThen again, Gener Motor ha continu to pump out popular cars, with global sale at 10 million (make the compani the No. 3 player). A big part of thi ha been the continu success in North America. But of course, China remain a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sale in the country. Keep in mind that the compani sell more in China than ani country, includ the U.S.But GM ha also been judici with discount and promotions. For the most part, GM is focus on make sure it make profits, not just on increas marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categori in technolog is the auto industry, as seen with the effort with oper likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM ha been ramp up it investments. To thi end, the compani made a $500 million invest inLyft(a top ride-shar startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisit ofCruis Automation(a develop of autonom car systems).Alreadi there are sign that GM is get traction. For example, the compani is test over 40 autonom Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. Thi is a mobil platform that allow a person to search and reserv a car and unlock it with a smartphone. Accord toGM: ""With more than 25 million custom around the world project to use some form of share mobil by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategi to chang ownership model in the automot industry.""It' import to note that GM ha the advantag of leverag it experi with OnStar, which ha been around for two decades. In fact, dure thi time, the system ha log about1.5 billion custom interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM ha certainli been sharehold friendly. Last year, the compani return a hefti $4.8 billion - in a combin of share buyback and dividends. In fact, GM stock ha a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuat is also attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn ratio is at a lowli 6.1X. True, thi may be deserv for a compani that is show declin growth. But as for Gener Motors, the compani expect to increas the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock doe look like a great valu play right now.3 Con on GM StockCompetition: The environ is brutal. And with more dealmaking, thing will onli get more intense. An exampl of thi is the allianc ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involv the purchas of a larg stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the compani were abl to realiz signific cost save and also hit a global sale number of nearli 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automak may need to reach level of15 million car sold annual to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevit increas becaus of the enorm cost of new technologies.A a result, a compani like GM may have littl choic but to look for a similar allianc or a transform acquisition, which would definit be riski and expensive.Politics: The elect of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potenti positives, such as with lower corpor tax rate and less oner regulations.But these may not offset the issu with Trump' anti-trad bent. If there is a border tax, thi could hurt GM becaus of it substanti product in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light product is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher price in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. Accord to theWal Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consider would wipe out a quarter of GM' region profit.""Glob Issues:Whil the market in China and North America have been robust for GM, there ha been much soft in mani other areas, such as in Europ and South America. Granted, there are sign of improv - but the progress ha been fairli slow. For example, in South America, GM ha been abl to cut back on the losses. But there wa still $374 million in red ink last year.A for Europe, the growth ha been sluggish across the continent. It also doe not help that England ha enact the Brexit, which ha caus a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europ last year and it appear there will not be break-even until 2018. To put thing into perspective, the compani ha not seen a profit in the region sinc 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhap the biggest issu face GM stock is the uncertainti regard Trump' trade actions. Although, given the import of the auto industri to the US economy, it doe seem reason that ani move will like be taken with care. Besides, Gener Motor CEO Mari Barra ha been savvi to meet with Trump sever time already.Ga Up With Chesapeak Energi Corpor (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is do a great job manag the core oper of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refresh model for five main brand in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra ha been aggress with invest in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especi given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand also ha hi own free iO app to estim your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

CEO Tim Cook hassaidthat Apple' Servic busi will be the size of a Fortun 500 compani sometim thi year, indic that growth isn't slow down anytim soon.Yes, Appl is still beholden to sale of the iPhone, iPad and the Mac for the major of it revenue, but the Servic busi is slowly, but surely, make Apple' revenu smoother and less lumpier from a quarterli perceptive. Visible, grow revenu is worth significantli more than revenu from hardwar that act like a roller coaster, with up and downs.Al investor need to do is look at the earn multipl for compani like Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and other to see the posit impact. Compani that have enorm subscription-bas revenue, which put off tremend amount of oper cash flow in a predict manner are ultim more valuabl than one that do not.Th compani ha a goal of doubl it Servic revenu by 2020, which is an admittedli larg task. But with a user base of over 1 billion activ devices, Appl should be abl to continu to grow part of it Servic business, like Appl Music and the App Store, as it continu to add new featur (namely, TV show for Appl Music).It' like we will hear more about Buffett' Appl stake in the day and week to come. If we do get commentari from the Oracl of Omaha himself, expect Servic and predict revenu to be a big part of the line of thinking.I know it would be for me."

I wouldn't be surpris if some compani deliber promot poor servic just so you won't call them. Thi of cours is just anoth reason whi Amazon stock is so special. They could rest on their laurels.

As you know, AMZN stock didn't do so well when Donald Trump won the gener elect on Nov. 8. Within a few days, share had fallen by as much as 9%. Thi is understand consid the bitter and contenti polit campaign season.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayEven by the end of 2016, AMZN stock wa conspicu lower than it pre-elect result close. However, that chang dramat at the start of the new year. Amazon stock gain some much-need traction, and shot abov the $800-mark. Sinc breach that psycholog barrier, AMZN ha yet to fall back below it. And for January, Amazon saw a robust 9% return.Thi is import becaus Januari is typic not a good time for Amazon stock. Of all the open month go back to 1998, share averag an extrem pedestrian 0.6%. However, annual return from 1998 through 2016 averag 84%.Such huge discrep made me wonder - are there indic in Januari that predict how AMZN stock will do later?Click to EnlargeTh answer is a resound yes.Thi past January' perform for AMZN stock wa the fourth best overall. Of the three other time that Amazon stock post better open months, investor later saw averag annual return of 120%. Inclus of everi posit January, AMZN still net an amaz averag annual return of 100%.That' not all. Of the seven year in which Amazon took a loss, six had Januari that also incur red ink. The one except occur in 2001, dure the immedi aftermath of the tech bubbl bursting. As long as Januari hold up, it' highli unlik to be on the lose end.Amazon' Fundament Look Great Too!I don't recommend make a decis on an opportun on the basi of a sole metric or indicator. The same can be said about statist data. Even the best-reason and logic calcul can't account for everi variable. Just like the elect of Presid Trump, there are certain element of unpredict that can and will bite you.Anoth Take - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?However, with AMZN stock, I think investor have a littl more buffer to play with thank to it solid fundamentals. Primarily, Amazon is still innovating. We saw a bit of that dure the Super Bowl commerci featur Amazon Prime Air. It' also a domin player in cloud computing, frustrat compani likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).And while I acknowledg it' riski for AMZN stock if it doesn't work out, I like Amazon' ventur into groceries. Granted, I'm not crazi on possibl rumor that the compani is think about roll out2,000 stores. But if they do thi right - particularli in trendi place like their Seattl hometown - AMZN could have anoth winner on it hands.Thes underli driver provid the confid for investor will to bet that Amazon stock will hit quadrupl digits. However, what can't be deni is the momentum. When AMZN get hot, it almost alway stay hot.

Usually, these are base on inform leak from the AAPL suppli chain, but on a veri few occasions, Appl itself inadvert tip it hand.makeArticleAd();Source: Wireless Power ConsortiumThat appear to be the case with the iPhon 8. For sever months, the 10th anniversari releas ha been rumor to featur wireless charging. Thank to an AAPL move, that now seem like a lock.AAPL Join the Wireless Power ConsortiumBusi Insiderbrok the newsthat Appl ha join the Wireless Power Consortium (or WPC). WPC is an industri associ that overse Qi, the most wide use wireless charg technology. That put AAPL in a group with over 220 other compani that are members, includ smartphon rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), whose Galaxi S7 support Qi wireless charging.Appl doe alreadi use Qi wireless charg for the Appl Watch, but the compani tweak it implement so it' not compat with standard Qi chargers. And it never bother to join WPC - until now. That move is a veri strong indic that AAPL is plan to incorpor Qi wireless charg on a larger scale, and that point to the iPhon 8.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveAppl confirm it had join WPC (although the confirm isn't realli necessari given that it' nowlist as a memberon the organization' website), but it did so by tri to minim the implications. A compani spokesperson toldBusi Insider:""Appl is an activ member of mani standard develop organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Appl is join the Wireless Power Consortium to be abl to particip and contribut idea to the open, collabor develop of futur wireless charg standards. We look forward to work togeth with the WPC and it members.""What WPC Membership Mean for iPhon 8 Wireless ChargingDespit AAPL' attempt to posit it move as busi as usual, join WPC is a strong indic that rumor about the iPhon 8 offer wireless charg have been on the mark. However, Qi isn't the advanced, over-the-air wireless charg mani peopl had been hope AAPL would implement.Instead, Qi - which ha been in use sinc 2011- use induct charging. Rather than plug an iPhon into a charger with a Lightn cable, it would be place on a charg pad. So there' still a recharg that requir physic contact, and that recharg is still plug into the wall.And it seem veri plausibl that wireless charg would be support by the iPhon 8, but onli offer as an extra at an addit cost. There ha alreadi been specul that AAPL would useopt wireless chargingto further drive up the amount consum spend on a new iPhon purchase. In thi case, they would have to add an Appl wireless charger to the tab (somethingSamsung charg an addit $49.99 forwith the Galaxi S7).Couldn't iPhon 8 buyer simpli buy one of the mani Qi charg pad alreadi on the market? They would undoubtedli be less expens than Apple' version.Well, there' also a good chanc that AAPL could pull a move like it did with the Appl Watch, tweak it Qi implement slightli so someon buy the new iPhon couldn't simpli use a standard third-parti Qi charger.Wil Qi Wireless Charg Make the iPhon 8 More Desirable?IH Technolog note thepopular of wireless charg with consumers, suggest it wa a featur AAPL couldn't ignor with the iPhon 8:""The success of wireless charg adopt from Apple' competitor is someth that Appl can no longer ignore. IH Technolog consum survey data show over 90% of consum want wireless charg on their next device.""Consum may be expect somethingmorefrom the iPhon 8, though.Qi wireless charg is mainstream now, and there were hope Appl would adopttruewireless charging, go with over-the-air technolog instead of follow the pack. Mani smartphon buyer skip Qi charg altogeth (the charg pad can actual be larger and more cumbersom than a plug-in charger), especi if it' an addit cost.Th abil to set a devic on furnitur or other accessori like speaker system ordesk lamp that have integr QI charg padsi cool, but if AAPL choos to go with a non-standard implementation, those probabl wouldn't work with the iPhon 8.Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Is on Cloud 9It may end up that wireless charg on the iPhon 8 is essenti a market move - a way to make extra money from those who care, and a bullet point on the featur list that keep the new iPhon on par with the competition.

For many, thi mileston is just one signal of cryptocurrency’ grow reput as a legitim store of invest value.Littl attention, however, ha been given to Bitcoin’ util as a day-to-day method of payment. Practic use case involv consum adoption, in fact, are rare talk about. Thi is despit the well-docu cost, effici and secur advantag of the Bitcoin payment network for both consum and busi alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-bas startup compani aim to chang thi through an effort to acceler the everyday use of Bitcoin for consum worldwide. Launch in May of 2016,iPayYoui an onlin platform and digit wallet that promot the viabil of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immedi saw earli success through a uniqu featur known as Pay-by-Twitt — the first onlin platform site for peer-to-p payment over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliv a caffein jolt to the retail sector, iPayY thi past Decemb introduc Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck (SBUX), a new way for coffe aficionado to pay for those espresso and other drink through the use of Bitcoin.Thi featur allow user to seamlessli transfer bitcoin from their exist iPayY Bitcoin wallet to their Starbuck mobil app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer befor prompt Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck to automat withdraw that amount from their iPayY account. Onc deposit into that person’ Starbuck account, purchas can be made via the mobil app at ani Starbuck location.Thi latest addit to the iPayY platform come on the heel of iPayYou’ recent gift card integration, allow Bitcoin to be use for instant gift card purchas from retail like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTun (AAPL).Thes creativ payment applic are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwid Director of Amazon Associates. With extens experi in the world of commerce, includ promin posit at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner develop iPayY with the intent of establish a easy-to-us Bitcoin wallet with simpl featur and low costs.Regard the strateg collabor with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader signific of thi move is that iPayY is abl to encourag Bitcoin to be spent in way that it creator intend — for everyday purchas from popular merchant without need a bank account to do so. Thi arrang with Starbuck allow coffe lover to replenish their primari Starbuck account with their Bitcoin holdings. We’v accomplish thi feat without Starbuck have to directli accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through thi demonstr Starbuck will soon begin accept Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In term of advantag for Starbuck regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not onli a great invest but is also becom quit use in everyday life. Becaus so mani of us are addict to coffee, be abl to use Bitcoin to purchas anyth at Starbuck is an enorm win for everyday consumers. And Starbuck will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin user who will now becom customers.”Ov time, Kavner believ that initi like thi will encourag merchant accept of Bitcoin. “Probabl the most import metric that everi merchant look at when decid what method of payment to accept is how mani new custom will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adopt of Bitcoin ha been the rel limit amount of peopl who want to use Bitcoin for PO transactions. Now, I believ that more and more will.”In term of what’ next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’r go to continu to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more use over 2017 and beyond. We are plan on expand to enabl more merchant adopt as well as ad mani featur that everi Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simpl to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin alreadi but for the everyday consum who may not even know what Bitcoin is. We’ll continu to innov to make Bitcoin easier and more use for everyone.”"

But compani that have the abil and opportun to grow their valuat from the million into megacap territori are quit rare.Furthermore, even when investor find one of these profit powerhouses, they often have a hard time sit still for the long period of time requir to let their invest thesi fulli pan out. Inform is now constantli at our fingertips, and with the rise of the internet and trade algorithms, hold time frame have seemingli been on the declin for years.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();However, there are a select few compani that have turn modest nest egg into verit treasur chest over the past 30 year or so. Had you invest $10,000 in ani of the follow three compani in May 1986, you'd have at least $3.68 million today. Best of all, one of them is a compani I can almost guarante you'v never heard of before.Balchem36,784% return, equat to $3.68 million from a $10,000 investment.If I ask for a show of hand to see how mani investor had heard ofBalchem(NASDAQ: BCPC) before, chanc are, not too mani hand would be raised. Balchem, which is still just a midcap compani today even after it 36,784% romp higher, provid anim nutrit products, food flavorings, and specialti ingredi to the industri and pharmaceut industry.What ha allow Balchem to thrive isn't so much it busi divers as it innov (and a littl bit of luck). As the stori wastold byTh Wall Street Journallast year, Balchem wa near a point of reckon in the mid-to-l 1990s, when it wa lose money hand-over-fist on a new nutrient coating. Thankfully, manag and Balchem worker were abl to doubl product without rais costs, and found ancillari revenu channel for exist products.Imag source: Balchem.An exampl the articl gave wa cholin salts, which are tradit develop for food supplement purposes. A staff engin at Balchem realiz that cholin salt could also stabil clay deposits. That eventu open a new revenu channel for the company, as frack for oil and ga requir the stabil of clay deposits. Interestingly, though, frack didn't becom a major technolog in the energi sector until year after the engineer' discovery. These innov pursuit have expand Balchem' product portfolio organically, allow it to wildli outpac theS&P 500.Today, Balchem look to be fairli valued, if not a bit pricey; but I guess that' to be expect after a nearli 37,000% run! Valu at 31 time next year' estim profit per share, Balchem would have to produc a major surg in anim and human nutrit and health sale to reason support a higher valuation.Monst Beverage50,843% return, equat to $5.09 million from a $10,000 investment.Innov wa also the drive forc forMonst Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST) , which ha deliv nearli 51,000% gain sinc May 1986. Monster' claim to fame are it energi drinks, which have onli grown in popular over the year with young adults.Ov the past 12 months, Monster ha gener nearli $3 billion in revenue, practic all of which wa tie to it namesak brand of energi drinks. By comparison, in 2006, it gener onli $606 million in full-year sales. Thi isn't to say the compani hasn't had it hiccups. In 2012, Monster wa the subject of a Food and Drug Administr investig into the death of five peopl who'd consum it energi drinks, which quell sale for a short period. However, as you can clearli see base on it latest sale numbers, those health safeti issu have been put in the rear view mirror.Imag source: Monster Energy.In recent years, Monster' biggest catalyst ha been a partnership withCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) . Under the agreement, Coca-Cola agre to contribut it energi drink portfolio to Monster, and Monster in turn sent it non-energi product portfolio to Coca-Cola. The deal also allow Coca-Cola to take a 16.7% equiti invest in Monster Beverage, give it access to the fast-grow energi drink market. Finally, distribut agreement between the two compani were amended, and sinc 2014 Monster' gross margin ha leap from 54.4% to 62.8% on a trail 12-month basis. The result wa a better-than-doubl of it net incom over the past three year for Monster.Monst Beverag isn't cheap after it run higher -- it share now sell for 30 time forward earn -- but unlik Balchem, it ha the potenti for double-digit percentag sale and profit growth for year to come. Though I'd expect the gain to be substanti more modest, Monster remain an intrigu invest opportunity.Microsoft64,633% return, equat to $6.47 million from a $10,000 investment.Last, but not least, we have the oper system kingpin,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , which ha gener a better than 64,600% return over the past 30 year and change.It' certainli not hard to understand whi Microsoft ha been so dominant. Despit numer effort dure the emerg of desktop and laptop comput to unseat it as the domin oper system provider, Microsoft dug in and cede veri little, if any, market share. Today, Microsoft' Window OS is so domin in the PC market, it' almost frightening.Imag source: Microsoft.Accord to NetMarketShare.com, as of Januari 2017, Window 7 and Window 10 combin account for 72.5% of all desktop oper systems. Group the less-popular XP, 8.1, 8, Vista, and NT together, and they kick in nearli anoth 19%. That give Microsoft a desktop OS market share of about 91.5%, and as you might have surmis -- correctli -- a lot of price power come with a verit monopoli on desktop oper systems.But Microsoft hasn't been without it faults. It Achilles' heel, perhaps, ha been it acquisitions; it big purchas have includ some notabl dud throughout the years. For example, Microsoft' acquisit ofNokia' handset busi and aQuant were both disasters. It $8.5 billion acquisit of Skype ha net the network a lot of custom usage, but veri littl in the way of financi benefits.Nonetheless, Microsoft remain a domin forc in PC oper systems, is regularli gener $23 billion to $26 billion in annual free cash flow thank to it substanti oper margin, and recent acquir LinkedIn, which will hope open new channel of revenu for the company. With annual EP growth throughout the remaind of the decad forecast to be roughli 10%, Microsoft may still offer modest upsid to patient investors.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Console Wars 2017: Will Sony or Microsoft Win?,2/10/2017,"Soni PlayStat controller. Imag source: Pixabay.Sony(NYSE: SNE) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have been battl each other in the game industri for 16 years. Game is far more import to the livelihood of Soni than Microsoft, and therefor the stake are much higher for Sony.makeArticleAd();Th consol war between Sony' PlayStat (PS) and Microsoft' Xbox ha grown more heat with time. The first round wa no contest. Sony' PS2 -- launch in 2000 -- outsold the origin Xbox by more than 100 million units. In the next cycle, the PS3 bare edg out the Xbox 360. So far in the current cycle, Sony' PS4 ha dominated, sell over 50 million unit compar to Microsoft Xbox One' 28 million.But Microsoft is plan a major counterattackTh start go Microsoft' way in 2016, when Xbox One began to outsel PS4. To a degree, thi may stem from some game receiv higher rate on Xbox One than PS4.However, Microsoft' momentum wa halt in it track in the fall when Soni releas two new version of it consol -- the PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro. The Slim is cheaper than the launch version and is more compact, while the PS4 Pro featur enhanc process power in order to display game in 4K resolution.Th consol landscap will chang again later thi year when Microsoft launch a new consol codenam ""Scorpio."" Report show Scorpio' technolog to be far superior to PS4 Pro. A develop for some Microsoft exclus game ha even claim that Scorpio is not an intermedi upgrad like Sony' consol and instead Scorpio is take a much bigger leap and is a full-blown, next-gener console.How can Soni defend it lead?Typically, there is not much that differenti compet consoles. If you set up a PS4 and Xbox One on two TV side by side, you would be hard press to notic a differ while view the same game.Th way consol maker differenti themselv is mainli through exclus first-parti games. Arguabl the three best franchis that are exclus to Microsoft' Xbox areHalo,Forza, andGear of War. However, Sony' exclus game portfolio is gener consid more attract than Microsoft's; thi is possibl partli whi Microsoft' Xbox ha never manag to outsel PlayStat through an entir cycle.A consol is a hit or flop base on the breadth of qualiti game avail for it. With thi in mind, there are sever titl Soni ha in develop for releas in 2017 that could keep gamer choos PlayStat over Xbox.Thre in particular areHorizon Zero Dawn,Gran Turismo Sport, and a new instal in the popularUnchartedseries. There' a long list of others, but these three game could each be contend for Game of the Year.In contrast, Microsoft doesn't have anyth in it arsen to match thi lineup. In fact, one of Microsoft' most anticip exclus game in develop wa recent canceled. It might have been better plan to releaseGear of War 4(releas thi past fall) in fall 2017 to give Microsoft a qualiti exclus game to show off Scorpio' graphic prowess. In the end, I wouldn't put it past Soni to discount the PS4 Pro around the time of Scorpio' launch.So thi beg the question: What kind of financi impact can a hit game provid Sony?Let' take a look atUnchart 4, a Soni exclusive, which wa releas in May 2016 and wa one of the year' top-rat games. For the quarter it wa released,Unchartedhelp Sony' game segment drive year-over-year revenu growth of 14.5%, and oper incom more than doubl to 44 billion Japanes yen.Thi isn't to say that the game releas thi year will each turn out likeUnchart 4. We can't know for certain how well each game will sell. But Soni appear to have sever exclus titl schedul for 2017 that are design to sell more PlayStat and provid a buffer against the invas from Microsoft' Project Scorpio.Gam is in Sony' DNAWith other Soni divis struggling, Soni is highli depend on it PlayStat business. It' crucial that Soni invest in a steadi stream of high-qual exclus games, and thi involv high risk. To a great extent, Sony' past success at beat Microsoft, in both game develop and consol sales, can be explain by Sony' depend on gaming.Therefore, my bet is Soni will hold it own in the ongo consol wars.10 stock we like better than SonyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

GE stock open Feb 10. at $29.65.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAround here we call that a win.Gener Electr is like a basebal team that is alway predict to win the pennant, but somehow never get out of the second division. Under Jeff Immelt, it ha turn itself inside-out to becom much like what it wa a centuri ago, a compani that build big engin to captur fuel and burn it.Th move wa cap bya deal take a major interestinBak Hugh Incorporated(NYSE:BHI), the oilfield servic firm.You will still findG stock bullsher and bless their heart. Gener Electr is a great old American compani with thousand of employees, and retirees, depend upon it.But I'm done, and unlessyou'r realli into yield, you should be done, too. Here is why.Leav GE StockImmelt ha been run the compani for over 15 year now and GE stock is still trade below where it wa when he started. It' also 25% below it 2007 peak.7 Marvel Mid-Cap Stock to Buy for the Best of All WorldsAft year of pound the tabl for the stock, Jim Cramer final threw in the towel thi month, say after an interview with Immelt that if Gener Electr fail to hit it 2017 target it will becom a ""must not own.""Th 2017 goal are modest, organ growth of 3% to 5%. The result would be a nice littl yield stock, but one that ha no excitement.For all of Gener Electric' talk about becom a softwar compani withPredix, it industri Internet of Thing platform, technolog remain a veri small piec of the business. Even if Predix were to hit it goal of $15 billion in sale for 2020, that would still be bare 10% of the current company.Buy ServiceMax, in November, for $915 million, and consolid the field servic manag arena, doesn't chang that underli reality. Link softwar and servic to sale of big ticket engin doesn't chang the fact that the money still come from the engines.That market is declining, and GE is a big reason why. When you make machin more energi efficient, when you make capit last longer, you eventu slow the replac cycle. Thing aren't broken, whi fix them?Gener Electr isbig in wind power, too, but that doesn't chang the fact that the vast major of the company' energi oper are focus on fossil fuels, especi after the Baker Hugh deal. Immelt ha been proclaim the futur while buy the past.Th GE Dividend OpportunityTher is an opportun here, but it is limit to investor seek income, retire and those with the patienc to watch paint dry.Should Bill Gate Sell Hi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock?Und Immelt, Gener Electr ha proven to be a reliabl payer of dividends. Over the last five years, for instance, those dividend have increas by nearli 50%, from 17 cent per share to 24 cents. Most years, GE' earn should clear those dividend rather easili - in 2016, it paid out 93 cent per share to investor while earn $1.Thi mean that the GE dividend is current yield 3.24%, against a 10-year bond rate of 2.4% and a 30-year bond rate of 3.02%. If you are seek retir income, you get a better deal with Gener Electr shares, especi if your incom is modest (dividend are taxabl income) than with U.S. govern paper. And GE stock might go up. As referenc earlier, Richard Saintvilus, an InvestorPlac contributor I trust, think it may rise 20% thi year.If he' right you have a bargain, even befor Immelt retir and someon els get the chanc to turn Gener Electr inside-out again.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL),2/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTher are two way to get big dividends: you can buy stock that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stock that consist grow their payouts.makeArticleAd();A well-balanc portfolio will includ both type of companies, withdividend-growth stocksb the cornerston of a longer-term incom strategy.Still, investor sometim get frustrat with dividend grower becaus to get their outsiz payout growth, you often have to settl for a low current yield. And whi buy a riski asset that yield 1% when you can get a long-term Treasuri that pay 2%?There are two answer to thi question. The first is that Treasuri aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rate go up, the valu of your Treasuri will go down. If you need to sell earli for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stock will increas their incom over time-someth Treasuri will never do. In fact, if you choos thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your incom skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world' most recogniz and popular brands:Appl Inc.(AAPL).If you read about invest in Apple, you almost alway see a focu on iPhon sales, the valu of futur product and so on. Bear note slow iPhon sale growth (or neg sale growth), devic that didn't quit catch on and rise competition. Bull counter that Appl ha a valuabl and uniqu market posit and innov product that captiv consumers.Both argument are realli miss the point.Th main reason to buy Appl is more bore but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let' start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, mean Apple' dividend-payout ratio is a measli 24%. But the realli amaz thing is how the company' cash flow ha explod and continu to rise:FCF Boot UpYes, there' been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF ha alreadi bottom out and is now back on the rise.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialTh next thing to consid is Apple' oper margin, which is current 27%. Thi is import becaus it mean the compani is so profit that it can continu to pay out dividend at the current payout rate. That oper margin ha fallen slightli in recent years, partli as a result of chang in the smartphon market, but it' still histor high:Appl Remain a Profit MonsterNot that we'v seen Apple' profit margin remain over 25% sinc 2009. Thi is great news for investors, but it also mean Appl ha becom a veri differ compani than it wa in the 1990 and 2000s. It' no longer a burgeon tech firm but an enterpris that reliabl and consist produc cash it can distribut to shareholders. In other words, it' a blue chip stock, not a specul bet.Again, great news for investors-especi those look for income. Ironically, mani dividend-growth investor forget about Apple, or they may alloc a veri small part of their portfolio to the compani out of fear that it' risky. That' a mistake.In the last five year sinc Appl start pay dividends, it payout ha soar 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compar that to some of the most popular and supposedli ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple' dividend growth is a big outperformer:Appl Trounc the RestA you can see,Gener Electr Company(GE), AT&T Inc.(T), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ), Chevron Corporation(CVX), Consolid Edison, Inc.(ED)andExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM)ar all grow their dividend at a slower pace than Apple.Th tech giant also ha a lower P/E ratio than all of these name (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It' time to think differ about Apple; thi is a rel safe dividend stock that is destin to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlin about iPhon sale may caus some volatil in the short term, the company' strong cash gener will reward you with big payout in the long run.Buy Appl Now … Then Add These 6 High YieldersThere' no doubt Appl is a best-in-class dividend-growth stock. But you also need high yield to go with that dividend growth-especi if you'r in or near retirement.Should Bill Gate Sell Hi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock?That' where the 6 reliabl incom gener in our new""No-Withdrawal"" retir portfoliocom in.

The Death Of The Commercial Database: Oracle's Dilemma,2/10/2017,"BySamadhi Partners:(click to enlarge)Contribut authors:John Freeman,Fr McClimans,Zach Mitchell.____W see the $29.6b commerci databas market contract 20-30% by 2021, and do not believ Oracl (ORCL) can transit it revenu stream (from legaci commerci databas to cloud-bas subscript offerings) fast enough to offset the declin of thi market, which repres a major legaci core of it revenue.makeArticleAd();(click to enlarge)Th commerci databas market - 80% of which is an oligopoli of Oracle, IBM (IBM), and Microsoft (MSFT) - ha remain one of the most stabl and sticki in all of tech for over two decades. However, we think the veloc and magnitud of it declin is like to surpris mani investors.(click to enlarge)Th deflationari pressur that have alreadi hit the databas market are just get started, including:Migr to SaaS, where most offer use free open-sourc databases;fast growth in use case such as social media, IoT, and unstructured/semi-structur data that are ill-suit to the SQL standard upon which the databas oligopoli is based;th increas stabil and function of a varieti of free open-sourc options, most of which are ""Not Onli SQL"" (NoSQL) and are therefor much better suit to the aforement use cases; andth disproportion larg benefit that NoSQL databas continu to realiz as a result of Moore' Law-driven improv in processors, memory, solid-st storage, and network throughput (these improv increas NoSQL' abil to handl both NoSQL and SQL use case on-the-fli and progress margin SQL-onli databas just as SQL-onli databas margin mainframe-bas databas dure the late '80 and '90s).Revenu from databas softwar repres ~36% of Oracle' total FY16 revenu and ~55% of it oper profit.(click to enlarge)Note: Databas Softwar and On-Premis Applic includ both licens and mainten revenue.Th company' declin in project databas revenu is distinct from and in addit to the declin in it on-premis applic revenue, which account for ~25% of total FY16 revenu and ~39% of oper profit.(click to enlarge)Microsoft and IBM will be hurt onli marginally, as databas softwar gener just ~5% of revenu for each.Without aggress action to significantli increas non-databas revenue, we do not believ Oracl can offset the oncom declin in commerci databas revenu fast enough to maintain it present valuation.Specifically, we believ Oracl need an even more radic and rapid organiz and cultur shift toward ""cloud-first"" that incentiv both it sale forc and it custom to move aggress into the cloud. The compani also need to consolid it variou home-grown and acquir cloud/Saa offer toward a singl platform in order to gener oper leverag down the road. Both of these initi will be pain in sever ways, especi financially, for a few year to come. To partial offset the pain, Oracl should divest it remain hardwar and other non-cor businesses.(click to enlarge)Source: Morningstar______ThemeExplanationFor those that are interest in a more technic dive, below is a deeper, histor explan of the five interrel trend that are gain momentum, and that will, in combination, caus the commercial-databas market to contract 20% to 30% by 2021:1. The Continu Enterpris Migrat to SaaS/Cloud.Except for a few of the first Saa offer that were built on top of an Oracl database, name Salesforce.com (CRM), NetSuit (N), and Oracl itself, it is difficult to find a Saa provid that use ani commerci database. For compani found after 2005, that number is virtual zero.Th vast major of Saa provid today either use an open-sourc database, or, as is the case with Saa HCM vendor Workday (WDAY), develop their own. Everi user of an on-premis enterpris application, includ one of the five core client-serv applic categories: ERP (Enterpris Resourc Planning), CRM (Custom Relationship Management), HCM (Human Capit Management), SCM (Suppli Chain Management), and BI (Busi Intelligence) applications, which move to Saa therefor elimin a commerci databas seat, and with it, the maintenance/support and futur upgrad revenu it would have generated. Even an enterpris seat that move to Salesforce.com will gener far less revenu for Oracl than that seat did when it wa deploy on-premises.Hence, we believ the enterpris migrat to SaaS/cloud is highli deflationari for commercial-databas revenue. Further, we are still earli in the migrat from client-serv to SaaS/cloud. Depend on which research one believes, thi migrat is onli 10% to 25% complet and is onli just begin to impact more mission-crit applic - such as ERP - that are more like to be run on higher-end SQL databas (includ those from Oracl and IBM, and to a lesser extent, Microsoft).2. Commerci SQL Databas are Not Well-Suit to Handl the Most Compel Emerg Use Cases.Aft SQL wa standard in 1987, it went unchalleng for over 20 year in defin how data wa organized, searched, and sorted. However, in the mid-2000s, coloss tech compani began run into the limit of SQL databas in handl both the sheer volum and vari structur (or lack thereof) of the data that they want to preserve, navigate, analyze, and serv up on-demand to their users/customers.Amazon (AMZN), Googl (GOOG) (GOOGL), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Facebook (FB) each solv it own scale problem by develop and implement it own databas softwar that broke with the constraint of the SQL standard.What' more, each compani releas open-sourc version of it databas shortli after. Dozen of new open-sourc databas were consequ produc in 2008 and 2009, lead to what Guy Harrison - the author of Next Gener Databas - term ""a sort of Cambrian explosion."" As a result of their departur from SQL, these databas all fell under the term ""NoSQL"" - even though most were as differ from each other as they were from SQL.Given the exponenti growth in the volum and varieti of data - driven by richer social media content, more social media users, and an explos of autonom captur IoT data - and given the increas desir for analysi on captur data, we believ the number of use case suit to NoSQL will soon far exceed those suit to SQL.The rise of these new use case will drive greater adopt by larg enterpris of open-sourc NoSQL solut at the expens of commerci SQL databases.3. NoSQL Databas and Schema-on-Read Process Are on the Right Side of Moore' Law;SQL and Schema-on-Writ Are on the Wrong Side. In general, NoSQL databas are substanti more processor, memory, and storag intens than SQL databases, even after consid the fact that they relax mani of the constraint that SQL place on how data is organized. Though NoSQL databas architectur exist well befor 2005 - at least, in theori - there wa simpli not enough process power, memori capacity, and storag space for them to be put to practic use outsid of academia.Dur the compar processor/memory/bandwidth-starv 1980 and 1990s, adher to the more-rigid SQL standard wa effect compulsori to ensur the perform and reliabl that enterpris need in order to migrat their applications, especi those more mission-crit applications, from mainfram and mini to the more-distribut and network-depend client-serv architecture.Th price paid for SQL' accept perform and reliabl wa driven by:Th overal inflex of the data structure, call a schema;th oner requir to defin that structur prior to the deploy of the databas and it associ applications;th difficulti in chang that structur over time in order to captur differ kind of data, and to better reflect chang in the structur of the data and in the organ of the enterprise; andth requir for a schema-on-writ process, which fit data into the schema as it is inputted, as oppos to schema-on-read, which is simpli dump data into a big ""container"" and organ it later into a schema.Ov time, however, Moore' Law-driven improv in process power, memori capac and speed, storag capac and speed, and network throughput have made the rigid of the SQL standard and the requir for schema-on-writ process increasingli less necessari and will continu to do so. Hence, with everi Moore' Law cycle, SQL and it resource-effici schema-on-writ process lose it competit advantage, while NoSQL, with it rel resource-ineffici but much more flexibl schema-on-writ process, becom increasingli free from the constraint that prevent it from be adopt in the first place.4. In-Mem Possibl and the Elimin of HDD Compromises. When SQL wa standardized, hard disk drive (HDDs) were the onli cost-effect storag medium that could be access in real time. Therefore, much of the fundament code written into SQL databas softwar is design to accommod the shortcom of HDDs, such as the slow speed with which they can read and transmit request data into memori and their rel higher failur rate - at least, compar to the major solid state compon of a system such as the CPU, memory, and network throughput. Now that SSD are rapidli becom a cost-effect replac for HDDs, much of the design and certainli much of the code of legaci SQL databas softwar that made such compromis in order to accommod compar much slower HDD is now render unnecessary.In contrast, mani NoSQL databas are written so as to take maximum advantag of SSD storag and will like be updat to take advantag of even faster-emerg non-volatil memori technolog such as Intel (INTC)/Micron' (MU) 3D xPoint, which is just now becom commerci available. We believ that, given the strong requir to maintain complianc with the SQL standard and maintain their own backward compatibility, SQL databas vendor will not be abl to optim their code for SSD nearli as fast as mani of the open sourc project will be abl to, put them further at a competit disadvantag - a classic exampl of Clayton Christensen' ""The innovator' dilemma"".5. Increas Avail of ""SQL Methadone"" Solut for Wean Enterpris Off Expens Commerci Databases. We are see an increas number of softwar tool and servic design to help enterpris migrat from commerci SQL databases. Even the most mission-crit applic run on an Oracl or IBM databas can be increasingli surrounded, ""quarantined"", and dismantl over time, much like what happen to mani of the legaci mainfram applic dure the shift to the client-serv architectur in the 1990s.While SQL databas from the like of Oracle, IBM, and MSFT will surviv in some enterpris for mani more year - again, much like mainfram - they will be increasingli margin and cost-reduc as much as possible. We see mani of these tool matur alreadi within the Hadoop ecosystem, which alreadi ha multipl way to integr with SQL databas and/or put SQL interfac and queri abil on NoSQL databases. In our opinion, thi is a veri similar develop to the early-1990 emerg of multipl way to integr mainfram applic with PC and client-serv applications.______To subscrib to the Samadhi Brief newsletter, pleas visit SamadhiPartners.com.

Unfortunately, over the last year or so, Genpact hasn't gener much sharehold impact, despit that catchi slogan. G stock is up around 3.5% just over a month into the new year, but is nearli that same amount in the red if we zoom out to the past 12 months.makeArticleAd();Still, I believ Genpact is about to start a more substanti recovery. Itsearningscal thi morn - includ an earn beat and a slight miss on revenu - could be the begin of a run that could talli up double-digit gain for 2017.More specifically, Genpact is a business-to-busi compani which hang it hat on efficiency. The compani offer digit solut relat to payments, process services, risk and compliance, custom and channel management, and busi insight and optimization. And it boast 75,000 employe in 25 countries.For the fourth quarter, G stock post earn growth of 21%, while it full-year earn growth wa around 16%. That' solid consid Genpact is face difficult currenc exchange.Genpact Stock a Good DealBut despit those headwinds, Genpact still offer great deal for shareholders, as stock ha a trail price-to-earn ratio of 21, which is well below the industri averag of 35, and a forward P/E of just 16. Thi latest earn beat wasn't a surpris either, as Genpact ha post an earn beat in each of the last four quarter as well.7 Marvel Mid-Cap Stock to Buy for the Best of All WorldsTh previou quarter repres the smallest beat thank in part to lower technolog spend in the invest bank and healthcar markets. But it wasn't too bad: non-GAAP earn still grew 9% year over year to36 cents- 3 cent better than Wall Street hoped.Plus, a recent acquisit by Genpact could fuel more growth down the line. The compani just reach an agreement to acquir an Australian arm ofFiserv Inc(NASDAQ:FISV), which serv three of the four major retail bank in Australia, handl approxim 70% of all check process in the Australian market, accord to the press release.Look forward a bit further, Genpact' earn are expect to maintain a double-digit averag over the next five years, smooth out right around 12%. That' almost doubl the averag of the last five years, when Genpact stock still manag averag gain of almost 7%.Add it up, and I like the move Genpact is make and I like the estim on tap. Effici is never go to go out of style across industries. Even if discretionari spend on B2B tech ha been soft in spot of late, I like the prospect for the near-term and believ Genpact stock ha some immedi valu to realize.I expect investor to realiz that now that the latest earn report ha come out, and recommend a buy befor Genpact get it post-earn pop.Hilari Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octan Trader,Absolut Capit ReturnandValu Authority.

Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?,2/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIn late December, I made apredictionthatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock would hit $80 in 2017. In reality, it wa less a predict than my agreement with Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin' 12-month price target for MSFT stock of $80.makeArticleAd();Source:Via MicrosoftMor than one month into the year and the Microsoft stock price ha a long way to go to reach thi lofti goal.It' fair to say that if MSFT stock is go to hit $80, Microsoft' burgeon cloud busi - an annual revenu run rate of $14.0 billion as of Q2 2017 - need to deliv more growth over the next three quarter (April, Juli and Octob earn announcements) to justifi to investor a forward2018price-to-earn ratio of 24.5.A I said in my earlier article, I think MSFT can deliv on thi front.But it got me think about Microsoft co-found Bill Gates, the world' richest person at $85 billion and the owner of approxim 179 million share of MSFT stock, a number that' been dwindl by approximately80 millionp year over the past decad or so; the proce go to fund the Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation.If thi pace continu Bill Gate will have reduc hi Microsoft stake to zero by sometim in 2019.Should Bill Gate Sell Hi MSFT Stock?No, I'm not talk about whether he should continu to fund hi foundat - of course, he should -I'm mere wonder if there wasn't a better stock to sell to fund the foundation' good works.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayA quicklookat the financi statement for the foundation' 2015 and 2014 fiscal year show that $11.3 billion wa spent over the cours of two year to fund it program around the world, an averag of $5.65 billion per year, about the same amount that Gate would current gener from the sale of 80 million share of Microsoft stock.So, from a financi plan standpoint, the 80 million figur make a whole lot of sense.Th hold of the trust that overse the invest and cash donat by the Gates' along with Warren Buffett for use by the foundat had a valu of $18.5 billion as of Septemb 30, 2016; more than half (57.8%) of the portfolio invest inBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Class B stock.Sinc August 24, 2006 through Juli 2015, Buffett ha donat 200.6 million share of Class B Berkshir Hathaway share to the foundation; thi past year, Buffett donat roughly15 millionshares. The remain 285 million share he agre to donat back in June 2006 will be dole out at a rate of 5% per year until all 500 million share are in the hand of the foundat sometim around 2036.So, the choic come down to whether it make sens to sell the share of Microsoft for cash to fund the foundation' work and continu to hold the Berkshir Hathaway share as an invest or the other way around.Th Gate have chosen the former rather than the latter.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuabl Than You ThinkOn the surface, that would seem to be a mistak given MSFT stock ha outperform Berkshir Hathaway Class B stock by 269 basi point on annual basi over the last five year through Feb. 6.So, with that in mind, doe it make sens for Bill Gate to sell hi MSFT stock?I don't think he should as some of it best growth lie in the immedi future. But, I also don't think the trust should sell Berkshir Hathaway stock becaus it provid such good diversif and protect of capital.Both of these stock are worth own for the long haul.If it were up to me, I'd probabl look at cash in some of the trust' other hold first, but thank for all those around the world deserv of the good educ and healthcar the foundat look to fund, it' not up to me.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendTh postShould Bill Gate Sell Hi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock?appear first onInvestorPlace."

Why I’m Raising My Price Target On Microsoft Corporation Stock (MSFT),2/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you thinkMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) share are expens now, they are about to get even more so.makeArticleAd();Back in December,I issueda 12-month piec target of $72 per share. But follow the company' breathtak fiscal second-quart earn results, I am now confid is too cheap.A such I'm rais my price target by $8 per share to $80 per share.Whi the price increase? For starters, Microsoft stock is current price at a forward P/E of just 21 base on fiscal 2017 estim of $2.97 per share. And while that P/E is two point abov the averag stock in the S&P 500 index, Microsoft' recent move suggest it deserv a much higher multiple.With growth opportun emerg in the realm of the cloud, Internet-of-Things, smart home and a host of other area thank to it recent acquisitions, Microsoft stock still look like a bargain. I'll get back to thi in a moment. But let' first assess it recent earnings.Th main question head into 2017 wa to what extent Microsoft could sustain the strong cloud momentum it use in 2016 to surpassAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN).Microsoft answer that question with authority. In three month that end December, the compani earn $5.2 billion, or 66 cent per share, rise from $5.02 billion a year earlier. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, earn came to 84 cent per share, which beat the consensu estim of 79 cent per share. Second-quart revenu came in at $24.1 billion, while adjust revenu wa $26.1 billion, also top Wall Street estimates.Th company' aggress move toward the cloud wa the main driver of the strong top- and bottom-lin beat. Not onli doe thi lessen Microsoft' relianc on declin PC sales, but cloud busi also gener higher margins. Revenu from the Offic 365 busi grew almost 50% year-over-year, while gross margin in it commerci cloud business, which includ Azur and Offic 365 product sold to businesses, reach 48% dure the quarter - up two percentag point year-over-year.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth Potential""Our custom are see greater valu and opportun as we partner with them through their digit transformation,"" said CEO Satya Nadella in a statement. ""Acceler advanc in AI across our platform and servic will provid further opportun to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.""Azur revenu surg 93% year-over-year (up 95% in constant currency) dure the quarter. Though Microsoft provid no specif dollar amount to help break down the cloud revenue, Bernstein analyst Mark Mordler estim Azur now gener some 20% of commerci cloud revenue, which Microsoft said wa gener an ""annual run rate"" just north of $14 billion, accord to Barron's. Thi mean Azur now gener quarterli revenu at around $3 billion.Between now and 2020, worldwid spend on public cloud servic is expect to soar to more than $195 billion. Thi is doubl the revenu the industri is expect to gener by the end of 2016, accord to a research firm IDC.""Cloud softwar will significantli outpac tradit softwar product deliveri over the next five years, grow nearli three time faster than the softwar market as a whole and becom the signific growth driver to all function softwar markets,"" said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, Saa and Busi Models. ""Bi 2020, about half of all new busi softwar purchas will be of service-en software, and cloud softwar will constitut more than a quarter of all softwar sold.""IDC is not alon in thi prediction. Pacif Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecast public cloud spending, current around $58 billion annually, will tripl to $205 billion in the next three years. Dure that span, Bracelin see spend on Saa servic to surg 20% annually, reach $129 billion by 2020.A Microsoft' cloud busi take up greater portion of it total revenue, Microsoft stand to secur larger piec of the cloud pie. And Microsoft, which dure the second quarter complet it blockbust $26.2 billion acquisit of LinkedIn, now ha even more way to attract busi to Azure. To that end, Microsoft stock should command a higher P/E of 4 to 6 point abov it current valuation.When appli a P/E of just 25 to fiscal 2018 estim of $3.26 per share, thi put the stock' fair valu at around $80.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers,2/9/2017,"Share ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant post mix fourth quarter earn and soft guidanc for the first quarter. Revenu rose 22% annual to $43.7 billion, but that miss expect by $980 million. The compani wa hit hard by currenc headwinds, which reduc it top line by about $558 million. Amazon' close watch AW (Amazon Web Services) revenu rose 47% annual to $3.54 billion, but that also miss expect of $3.6 billion and repres a slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expect 14.1% to 22.7% year-over-year sale growth, which miss analyst forecast for 23.4% growth. But on a currenc neutral basis, which exclud an expect currenc impact of $730 million, Amazon expect it revenu to rise 17% to 25%.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Som neg report about Amazon focus on those headlin numbers, but they gloss over mani of the posit growth figures. Let' take a look at six incred number from that report that investor shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDur the fourth quarter, Amazon' net incom rose 55% annual to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat expect by $0.19. For the full year, it net incom surg over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incred growth wa mostli attribut to the rapid growth of AWS' high-margin business, which give Amazon much more freedom to expand it e-commerc ecosystem with low-margin hardwar like it Echo speakers, loss-lead servic like Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logist solut like new fulfil center and drones.2. AWS' oper margin of 26%AW finish last quarter with an oper margin of 26%, compar to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expans indic that AWS' massiv scale is offset tough price competit across the cloud platform market, which caus Amazon and it rival to reduc their price throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announc that AW had achiev an annual run rate of $14 billion, indic that it maintain a command lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azur in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claim that it ""commerci cloud"" had achiev an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of that total came from Saa platform like Offic 365 and Dynam CRM. Azur -- which compet directli against AW in the IaaS/Paa ""cloud platform"" market -- account for a much smaller percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclos how much revenu Azur generates, but combin earlier industri estim and it report growth rate over the past few quarter indic that it annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AW featuresAmazon alreadi serv massiv custom like NASA, the CDC, andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it' continu widen the platform' competit moat against rival platform like Azur with new features. Amazon ad over 1,000 new featur and servic to AW in fiscal 2016, compar to about 700 in 2015.It also open eleven new AW Avail Zone across five geograph region in 2016, bring AWS' total coverag to 42 Avail Zone across 16 region globally. That massiv data center expans will help AW reach more compani and developers, all while support the expans of it e-commerc and digit ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digit ecosystem expans is Prime Video, the company' stream answer to Netflix. Amazon ha made the platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscrib and a stand-alon subscript servic that cost slightli less than Netflix.Lik Netflix, Amazon is invest heavili in origin content, and popular show likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelp it becom the third largest video stream platform in the U.S. after YouTub and Netflix last year, accord to research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also follow Netflix' lead and invest heavili in local origin content in key market like Japan and India, which could help expand it Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skill for AlexaAmazon also taught it voic recognit platform Alexa 4,000 new skill sinc last October. It note that ""ten of thousand of developers"" are build new skill for the platform -- which power the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devic -- and that it wa work with ""a lot of major companies"" to integr their product with that ecosystem.Th expans of the Alexa ecosystem is important, becaus it can give Amazon control of users' connect home via Dash buttons, DRS-enabl appliances, and other connect devices. In addit to boost it e-commerc revenu with ""frictionless"" orders, that platform can process data through AW and widen it moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet' Google, which is tri to establish it own home-bas ecosystem around it Home smart speaker.Th key takeawayAmazon' fourth quarter report wa lumpy, but investor shouldn't overlook these posit numbers. Analyst still expect Amazon' revenu and earn to respect rise 22% and 53% next year -- so it overal growth won't peak anytim soon. Therefore, I believ that investor should take advantag of Amazon' temporari swoon and pick up a few more share for the long term.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Voice Control Platforms a Key Technology Trend in 2017,2/9/2017,"Technolog compani have spent year on comput linguist to solv the basic problem of make machin more effici in an era where they would have to deal with bigger data load and more complex queries. One of the product of thi research is voic driven artifici intellig that can connect and drive everyday devic to understand human speech and react accordingly.Th most basic form of voic technolog is a person direct a machin to do routin task such as play a track, read the mail, send autom respons to mail and such thing that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home autom is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appli use in the home can also take voic commands? And sync with each other to decid the desir activ and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhil Microsoft ha mani year of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat ha realli taken voic control platform mainstream. The compani launch it first Echo devic a coupl of year ago and sold more than seven million devic last year. While mani of them were the cheaper Dot, it still put Alexa, Amazon' voic assist into that mani new homes.At thi year' CES, Amazon had a coup as compani rang from FordF, Huawei and LG to a larg number of startup unveil phones, cars, home applianc and other gadget with Alexa integr make Amazon' voic assist that much more useful.And Amazon ha doubl down to develop Alexa' ""skills,"" which are discret voice-bas applic that allow the system to carri out specif task (like order pizza for example). At launch, Alexa had just 20 skills, which ha reportedli jump to 5,200 today with the compani ad about 100 skill per day.In fact, Bezo ha said, ""We'v been work behind the scene for the last four years, we have more than 1,000 peopl work on Alexa and the Echo ecosystem … It' just the tip of the iceberg.""Just last week, it launch a new websit to help brand and develop creat more skill for Alexa. It also ha a home consult servic call ""simplifi your life"" where Amazon rep teach you to autom your home use Echo and Alexa. But all thi work simpli becaus everyth is connect with AWS, which transmit data between differ devices.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGoogl Ha Jump InAmazon is clearli the leader in voic control platform today, but competit is in hot pursuit. Googl Home wa launch late last year and the search leader will do all it can to grow market share.To prove the point Googl too had some import announc for the Googl Assistant, which drive Googl Home. But some of the most import deal were for integr into Hyundai' navig system, Chrysler' 300 model, NVIDIA'sNVDAShield TV as well as other such as Belkin smart switches, Switchmat smart lights, Coway Airmega air purifiers, etc. Googl still ha mile to go befor it catch up with Amazon, but it' made a strong start.Googl ha the most to lose if it can't make it big here becaus a lot of voic search will probabl happen through these assist go forward. But it also ha an advantage, i.e., all the inform it ha curat over the years, your prefer and your habit that it can draw from to serv you. In short, it know you better.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus|Alphabet Inc. QuoteAppl Also in the FrayAppl doesn't have a separ Home device, but a use app of the same name that can connect all the smart devic in your home and get them to commun with each other. So it' also depend on the number of gadget maker support the app and thi number ha been swell in the recent past.Whil Apple' partner aren't make the news as much as the other two, there are a host of switch, light, camera, sensor, secur system and other such devic maker that have been announc their support for Apple' platform the last coupl of CESs (Appl make it a point to stay away from the show).Appl Inc. Price and ConsensusAppl Inc. Price and Consensus|Appl Inc. QuoteSamsung Take NoticeSamsung paid a cool $8 billion to acquir auto infotainment, acoustics, display and other system supplier Harman. That is a big sum to pay, although justifi consid that Harman doe offer a number of product that would be complementari with the display and chip that are an import part of the increasingli electron and soon-to-b self-driv cars. IH iSuppli expect the market to grow from $42 billion in 2016 to $61 billion next year.But there' more: just last year, Harman announc a number of collabor indic it grow import in the world of voic activ controls. In September, it agre to incorpor Baidu speech recognit and synthesi technolog in smart speaker so peopl can use voic command to turn on audio experi and access on-demand services.Earlier, the two collabor to creat CarLif offer advanc Internet capabilities, entertain featur and location-bas servic on HARMAN' in-vehicl infotain head unit for the Chines market. At the World of Watson confer last October, Harman collabor with IBM to bring voic activ intellig assist base on IoT and cognit comput to hotels, offic and hospit across the world.Along Come SoundHoundKeyvan Mohaj of SoundHound says, ""We are at the inflect point of our long-term vision that everi product or servic need to have a smart voice-en interface, and consum have increasingli high expect for thi requirement, beyond simpl command or skills,"" said Mohajer.H may be right becaus of the $115 million rais in it 10-year long life, $75 million wa contribut just last week from a group of compani includ NVIDIA, Samsung' Catalyst Fund, Nomura Holdings, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Recruit Holdings' RSI Fund, Kleiner Perkin Caufield & Byers, SharesPost 100 Fund and MKaNN. Global Catalyst Partners, Walden Ventur Capit and Translink Capit Partner particip for a second time.Th reason the invest is signific at thi junctur is SoundHound' voic interfac technolog call Houndifi that will now be empow to reach more users. Houndifi wa incorpor into more than 500 product within the first 12 month of launch.It popular in the past and whi compani like Samsung and NVIDIA are interest in it right now is simple. The technolog is not design to take over the devic or transfer data to SoundHound unlik platform like Alexa and Googl Home. So it prolifer will let devic maker employ the technolog and also retain user data. Houndifi alreadi ha 20K develop work on the platform and thi number could expand rapidli with the cash infusion. Houndifi alreadi hasSum UpInteract with machin is set to becom more interest than ever befor as they gradual understand our need to get thing done the way we want it even befor we tell them to or perhap right after. Sinc thi is a nascent market, there may not be ani clear winners. Right now it doe look as if there' enough growth opportun for all the abov player and more.Zacks' Top 10 Stock for 2017In addit to the stock discuss above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold ticker for the entireti of 2017?Who wouldn't?

They can be exot and there is a higher degre of risk associ with them, depend on what one' invest goal are. I made big mistak use option earli in my invest life becaus I didn't realli have a clear purpos for use them.makeArticleAd();Source:401(K)2012 via FlickrHowever, there is one basic strategi that may be of interest to the averag incom investor, and it' a strategi involv cover calls. Thi is one of a few strategi I'll be use in my forthcom stock advisori newsletter,Th Liberti Portfolio.With cover calls, you either own a stock or purchas it, and then sell the right, but not the obligation, for anoth person to buy that stock from you at a given price on a given day. It gener incom for you when you sell the call.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowI sometim like to use blue-chip stock when sell cover calls. That' becaus they tend to have modest premiums, and if you don't have the stock call away, you are still own a qualiti company. If it doe get call away, you can alway buy it back.Cov Calls: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime candid for sell cover call against blue-chip stocks. Believ it or not, MSFT is right near it all-tim high and it ha ton of cash.I actual think it' overpr here at 30 time earn with onli 10% earn growth, so if you own it and it get call away, you may want to consid wait for a price drop befor buy back in.MSFT close Wednesday at $63.34. The 24 March $63.50 cover call are sell for $1.10. That' a veri modest return of 1.74% for a hold period of 44 days, or about 13% annualized. It' a bit less than I'd like to get, but reasonable.Cov Calls: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Oil price seem to have stabil butExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) ha fallen out of favor with investors. After do except well compar to most blue chip in the oil patch, XOM stock ha flounder a bit.I think it' due to concern over big expens come up, but I think thi is unfounded. As I'v written, I believ the Rex Tillerson confirm will eventu lead to the big Rosneft deal start to produce.There' probabl also some concern about valuation. On an EV-to-Ebitda ratio, which I think is the best way to evalu the big producers, it' expens compar to almost all of it peers. Thus, I think a near-to-medium term declin seem likely, so have XOM call away is not a bad thing.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenXOM close Wednesday at $81.50.

That' 2.2% return in 44 days, or about 18% annualized.Cov Calls: AT&T (T)Source: ShutterstockAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) can sometim be one of the blue-chip stock to sell cover call against. For starters, despit it mountain of debt, it produc amaz amount of free cash flow.It usual pay out about half to cover it 4.77% dividend. It recent hit a multi-year high, ad DirecTV to it portfolio, and is now tri to merg withTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX).Th merger make great sense, but given Presid Trump' hawkish toward media these days, some peopl think he might tri to pressur agenc to block it. I don't think that'll happen, but it may put near-term pressur on the stock.T close Wednesday at $41.21. The 24 March $41.50 cover call are sell for 65, cent which is a return of 1.6%.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers,2/9/2017,"One of the mani interest detail reveal inSnap' S-1 file with the SEC is that it agre to a $2 billion contract with Googl Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiari span five year with rel equal payment schedul for everi year.Snap ha use Googl Cloud sinc it creation, but had been spend consider less than the $400 million per year it' slate to spend through 2021. For the first few year of it existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Googl Cloud. Last year, however, it start see it host cost increas considerably, up $192 million for the year.Imag Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google' cloud servic compet against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Servic andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infus could help it catch up to the competition.What doe $2 billion mean to Googl Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactli forthright with it cloud revenue. It lump Googl Cloud in with Google' other revenu line item, which also includ Googl Play and hardwar sales. In 2016, the three categori produc $10.1 billion in revenue. Googl Play like account for the bulk of revenue.Th cloud unit had an estim run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, accord to RBC Capital. Snap' new contract like make it Google' biggest cloud customer.Whil Googl ha made sever advanc in it cloud servic over the past year, so have it competitors. Microsoft boast that it Azur revenu increas 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estim the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein' Mark Mordler estim Azure' run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just report AW sale top $12 billion in 2016. Sale surpass $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analyst expectations.Googl still need to diversifyTh growth of Snapchat ha been a major boon to Google' cloud services, but it' still activ seek to pull custom away from it competitor and take market share. The hire of cloud-comput veteran Dian Green to lead the divis ha help the compani attract numer high-profil customers, but there' still more work to do.On Alphabet' fourth-quart earn call, Googl CEO Sundar Pichai said, ""We have truli differenti offer in four key areas: data analyt and machin learning, secur and privacy, tool for applic development, and the abil to creat connect busi platforms."" Snap can take advantag of at least three of those four factors, so it' clear whi it wa will to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap want to enter China, for example, where Googl doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google' competitors. Or it could build it own servers.Snap recent hire Jerri Hunter from AWS, who ran global data center for the cloud-comput giant. In Snap' S-1 filing, manag notes, ""In the future, we may invest in build our own infrastructur to better serv our customers.""If Snap continu to grow at the pace it ha been for the last few years, it may make econom sens for it to switch to it own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What thi mean for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggl room: The contract say it can postpon up to 15% of expens for a year, so it onli ha to spend $340 million thi first year. Still, that' a huge amount for a compani that gener just $404.5 million in revenu last year.It also mean that switch servic provid will be difficult, consid it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leav at least some of it oper on Googl Cloud in order not to wast the money. That make the econom of build out it own infrastructur within the next five year even costlier.On the flip side, analyst expect Snap' revenu to continu grow at a rapid pace, approach $1 billion thi year fuel by continu user growth and product expans that will sure put addit demand on Google' servers. It ha plenti of capit to cover the expense, and if last year' growth is ani indic of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructur thi year. The deal with Googl ensur that it get the lowest rate possible, so it can to make the most of it spend.Overall, it' not a bad deal for Snap, but it doe tie the compani to Googl for a long time.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the toplin figur wasn't the onli concern, as FireEy guid to a 3% declin in first-quart revenue, compar to the Street' expect 5% growth.Among the myriad of problem face the company, includ slower corpor enterpris spend and increas competit in the cybersecur market, FireEye' late restructur into a cloud-subscript model is almost unforgiv - especi when blue-chip secur firm were alreadi head that direction.But there is a bright side for FEY stock investors, at least over the short term. Bar ani other major surpris or manag short-sighted (CFO Mike Berri and board chairman David DeWalt are both step down, which could help), the worst appear to be alreadi factor into FEYE' price. As such, liter ani posit news for the compani could kick off a short-term bounce.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowA usual, potenti driver for such a bounc would come from FEYE' sentiment backdrop. For instance, Thomson/First Call report that 21 of the 31 analyst follow FEY stock rate the share a ""hold"" or worse. The fact that there aren't more ""sell"" rate after last week' quarterli report tell me that Wall Street is readi to reward FireEy for move in the right direction. In other words, upgrad are a distinct possibl follow ani posit progress.Elsewhere, short seller are alreadi take profit on FEYE. As of the most recent report period, the number of FEY share sold short drop by 3% to 20.3 million. Still, roughli 13.3% of FireEye' float remain sold short, and could spark a round of profit take or a cover ralli if the stock can find it feet and move higher.Click to EnlargeJudg by FEYE' option configuration, short seller may be prepar for just such an outcome. Currently, the March put/cal open interest ratio for FEY stock rest at 0.44, with call more than doubl put among option set to expir on March 17.FEY is trade well below all major put and call accumul in the series, with the $13 strike home to peak put OI and $14 repres the next signific call OI strike, leav littl in the way of potenti option headwind in the short term.March implieds, meanwhile, are price in a potenti move of about 12.6% for volatil FEY stock. Thi place the upper bound at $12.39, while the lower bound rest at $9.61.2 Trade for FEY StockCal Spread:Bearish sentiment on an underperform stock is to be expected, but FEY stock is trade at oversold level follow a post-earn beating. With said beat now out of the way, FEY should trend higher, with ani posit news provid addit lift.Thos trader look to take a risk on an FEY comeback over the short-term might want to consid a March $12/$13 bull call spread. At last check, thi spread wa offer at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lie at $12.19, while a maximum profit of 81 cents, or $81 per pair of contracts, is possibl if FEY stock close at or abov $13 when March option expire.Th Smart Money: Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Is Alreadi InsolventPut Sell:Thos look for a more bullish-to-neutr posit may want to look at a FEY March $10 put sell position. At last check, thi put wa bid at 25 cents, or $25 per contract. Rememb that you keep the initi premium receiv as long as FEY stock close abov $10 when March option expire. However, if FEY trade below $10 ahead of expiration, you could be assign 100 share of stock for everi put sold at a cost of $10 per share.A of thi writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Stock to Buy for Their Come ReboundTh 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stock TodayTh postBurn by FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock?

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improv your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it ha been lethal for investors. Dure the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrend 60%. Thi is certainli anoth case studi of how high-profil IPO can quickli come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a valu play here?A I'v written variou time for InvestorPlace, it' probabl not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a compani that develop a product that realli is not a must-have. Accord to a recent studi fromGartner, the abandon rate on fit tracker is 30%. The most common reason for thi include: user either get bore or the devic breaks!Th conclus from the report: ""Dropout from devic usag is a seriou problem for the industry. The abandon rate is quit high rel to the usag rate. To offer a compel enough valu proposition, the use for wearabl devic need to be distinct from what smartphon typic provide. Wearabl maker need to engag user with incent and gamification.""Th Other Problem for FIT StockBut thi is definit not the onli major issu with Fitbit stock. Let' face it, the competit environ remain intense. The compani must fight against tough rival likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Appl Watch, which is still in the earli phases.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterIn light of all this, is it ani wonder that Wall Street is concern with FIT stock? Of cours not.Mor importantly, the compani is alreadi report major problems, as seen with the latest warn on fourth-quart earnings. Fitbit' guidanc call for a loss of 51 cent to 56 cent a share on revenu of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast wa for earn of 14 cent to 18 cent a share and revenu of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it look like the holiday season turn out to be a disast for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situat isexpect to continue. The full-year predict is for revenu of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cent to 44 cent a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, wa look for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-lin and profit of 64 cent a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT ha a plan that look weak. The compani expect to reduc the workforc by mere 6% and to take other vagu effort to reduc oper costs, leverag data and launch product into new categories. Interest enough, Fitbit want to focu more on the smartwatch market, but thi will like mean more expenses.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO Jame Parksaidthat the issu with the compani were ""temporary"" and the ""perform is not reflect of the valu of our brand, market-lead platform, and company' long-term potential.""Huh? Well, thi realli doe seem like the talk of someon who is out-of-touch. And thi should definit be omin for holder of FIT stock.Granted, perhap there may be a buyout. But when it come to broken hardwar companies, thi may be wish thinking. For example, think about how long the rumor for a purchas of the beleagueredBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be veri interest to a suitor. And thi is not becaus the product are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simpl as that the market ha hit matur level and that big player like AAPL stand to captur a big part of what' available.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbook.

But it' tough to ignor how GPRO stock, which is trade near 52-week lows, look attract from a risk versu reward perspective.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)GoPro stock close Friday at $9.58, down 12.7%. Even with Friday' punishment, the stock is still up 10% year-to-date, best the 2.3% rise in theS&P 500index.Indeed, the fact that the compani lower guidanc for the current quarter may have creat a ceil for the GPRO stock. For the current quarter, GoPro, which did not issu an earnings-per-shar forecast, expect revenu of $200 million, up 9% year-over-year. Thi compar to Wall Street' estim for $264 million.However, while the market focus sole on the the revenu miss and guide-down, investor ignor that not onli did GoPro' profit margin improve, the company' adjust EP of 29 cent beat estim by 7 cents. Notably, the $115.7 million loss the compani post in the fourth quarter, much of the total wa due to a tax charg of $102 million.Plus, despit revenu of $540.6 million miss consensu estimates, it wa nonetheless encourag that GPRO manag to grow quarterli revenu by 24%. And with the compani resum Karma sale recently, there could also be a near-term floor on GoPro stock. Not to make light of the headwind the compani face with a slow market for cameras, but GPRO still ha a domin retail presence, which give it an advantag over it competitors.Two Question for GPRO StockAt the same time, GoPro is cut cost to improv profitability. However, two main question remain: How deep will the cut go and can GoPro execut the cut to achiev both revenu and profit objectives. In that regard, at some point CEO Nick Woodman, who promis last year that GoPro would be profit in the fourth quarter, may now want to consid ""explor strateg alternatives.""7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThat is anoth way to say, a possibl sale of the compani should be on the table, which could free GPRO stock.Mor to the point, it' no longer a certainti that Goodman and gang can be trust to lead GoPro out of thi rut. Despit the mani advantag GPRO ha had as a brand, there have been too mani misstep by manag and self-inflict wounds. Setback from the Hero5 camera and the Karma drone, which wa recal becaus of in-flight batteri problems, are glare examples.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) are two name with significantli better manag that I think can take GoPro stock to the next level. Microsoft, which alreadi ha success with consum products, such as the Xbox, should be abl to leverag GPRO' camera andsoftwar toolsto enhanc it AR and VR ambit with HoloLens.A for Facebook, GoPro' drone and camera' would be ideal for Facebook' live video ambit and 360 degre technology. And with GPRO' market cap now valu at just $1.35 billion and an enterpris valu of $1 billion, it would be a drop in the bucket for either company.

(AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200,2/6/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) deliv excel earn news Jan. 31 that push Appl stock to it highest level sinc the summer of 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat' great news for long time owner of Appl stock who'v had to suffer through a delug of naysay proclaim it lack of innovation. More than a few have even suggestedinvestor dump AAPL stockand buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in it place.Hey, I like Microsoft and I think what it'sdo in the cloudi go to help it continu to grow over the next decade, but it' not in the same leagu when it come to revenu and profit growth. Microsoft does, however, have a busi model that' transit from one-tim product sale to ongo monthli recur revenue, someth mani observ have note is happen at Apple.Yes, Appl did sell more than78 millioniPhon in the first quarter, roughli five million more than it sold in the same quarter a year earlier, but it wa the servic revenu that had everyon in a tizzy.Jim Cramer liken the Appl busi model toth Gillett busi model, where consum buy a singl razor and keep buy new razor blades; onli in Apple' situat the iPhon is the razor and servic such as the App Store are the razor blades.Y gotta love recur revenue. Cramer does:""What ha dog Apple' stock for ages, what ha kept it share price so low, at least in term of it valuation, is the 'Blackberry-ization' issue,"" Cramer said onMad MoneyFeb. 1. ""The notion that in the end, the iPhon is just a devic and devic compani eventu get wast asBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) did.""7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThere' no question recur revenu is good for a company' top and bottom line and should be welcom news for owner of Appl stock, but is it enough to drive Appl stock through it all-tim high of $134.54 and upward to $200?That' debatable.Whil Apple' servic revenu hit$7.2 billionin the first quarter, 18% higher than a year earlier, it' still onli 9% of the company' overal revenue, or 100 basi point higher than a year earlier.Bi comparison, Microsoft' second quarter saw it servic and other revenueincreas 29.7% to $7.5 billion. The onli problem with that for Microsoft is the gross margin are 40% compar to 67.5% for it product revenue, which account for 68.5% of it overal revenue.Y want your recur revenu gross margin to be higher than your product margins, not lower; becaus if that' the way the world is headed, both stock are look at lower profit in the future.Appl doesn't break down it gross margin between product and segments. Overall, it gross margin in Q1 2017 wa 38.5%, 160 basi point less than in Q1 2016. Microsoft' overal gross margin in it latest quarter wa 58.9%, consider higher than Apple's.That would seem to suggest Microsoft' in a better posit when it come to servic revenue. It is both grow thi aspect of it busi faster than Appl and make more from everi dollar of revenue. From thi perspective, Appl is doomed.A quick look farther down the incom statement, however, provid some clarity: Apple' oper margin in Q1 2017 wa 29.9%; Microsoft' Q2 2017 oper margin wa 25.7%, or 420 basi point less than Apple.Th biggest reason for thi difference: Microsoft spend about three time as much per year on research and develop as Appl does; Appl spent 4.7% of it revenu in the trail 12 month on R&D compar to 14.4% for Microsoft. And when you'r talk about billion of dollar of annual revenue, the differ add up quickly.Which bring us back to Apple' grow servic revenue: InvestorPlac contributor Brad Moon highlightedth posit of Apple' servic revenuerecently. A coupl of hi point stick out for me.Don't Bet Against the Dow Jone Industri AverageFirst, the App Store had $3 billion in revenu in Decemb - a record. Secondly, Appl paid out more than $20 billion to develop in 2016. Extrapol December' App Store sale over 12 month and you get $36 billion in revenue. Subtract $20 billion paid to develop in 2016 and that leav a gross profit of $16 billion and a gross margin of 44%, which is pretti darn healthi consid veri littl R&D is requir to keep that up and running.Can recur revenu take Appl stock to $200? I believ it can. When, however, is anoth story.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Big Buyout Deal That Could Crush Investors9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99The postHere' How Appl Inc.

Microsoft ha an impress opportun to drive commerci sales, with the compani call out a major contract with the U.K. Custom Servic on it Q2 confer call.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryGrowth in Azur ha been even more impressive. Revenu increas 93% in the second quarter and 104% in the first half of FY17. Microsoft remain well behindAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and it Amazon Web Servic business. But, it ha a clear opportun to get to at least second place in what should be a large, fast-grow end market. That portend year of growth in Azure, a potenti driver for MSFT stock.At the same time, however, Microsoft is a huge company, with trail twelve-month revenu over $85 billion. And, neither Azur nor Surfac repres a signific portion of those overal sales. Microsoft still doesn't break out Azur sales, but estim suggest roughli $3 billion in fiscal 2017 - less than 4% of overal revenue.P the MSFT 10-K, Surfac sale were about $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and those sale actual declin 2% year over year in the second quarter. Some of that weak came from the company' phase out of Surfac 3, and gross margin have improved. But, Azur and Surfac combin are still less than 10% of total revenue. Even ad cloud comput as a whole, the figur bare get to one-quart next year, as MSFT is target a $20 billion run rate for commerci cloud.Simpl math show that it' tough for Microsoft to grow as a whole if onli a small portion of revenu is drive that growth. Indeed, that' been the case thi year. Overal revenu grew just 1.2% in the second quarter, and 0.8% for the first half. Exclud phone sale - where Microsoft ha all but ha exit the busi - top-lin growth wa still under 5% in Q2 and Q1.Yet MSFT stock now is price as a growth stock. That might be aggressive.MSFT Earn Still Reli on Offic and WindowsTh problem for MSFT stock is that so much of Microsoft' busi still come from it better-known products. The More Person Comput segment gener nearli 50% of first half sales. That includ Window revenu - which wa almost 20% of FY16 sale - along with Xbox, Search, and devic (includ Surface).Surfac aside, that' not a particularli attract group. Window revenu seem like to declin over the long term and ha declin in each of the last two fiscal years. Bing ha perform well of late, but in part becaus Microsoft ha spent up to attract traffic. The Product and Busi Process segment is almost one-third of sales. Prior to Microsoft' acquisit ofLinkedIn Corp, it consist primarili of Offic and Dynamics, MSFT' CRM solution.First-half growth ha been impressive, grow about 7%, exclud the contribut from LinkedIn. But, that come after revenu in the segment declin between FY14 and FY16. While Offic 365 sale growth look solid, much of that growth is simpli come from a shift to ""on-premise"" Offic licenses.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockTher are two concern about the long-term growth prospect of Microsoft stock. The first is that some of the recent headlin growth in categori such as cloud and offic is simpli come from exist products. Some Azur sale are come from custom switch away from Microsoft SQL Server. Offic 365 sale aren't go to new custom who didn't have word process software; rather, most subscrib are former user of disk-bas Offic products.A Trade War With China Put These Stock at RiskTh second concern is that so much of the busi is stagnant (though bull might say ""stable"" instead). That make overal growth tough: if 20% of the busi grow 20%, and the rest is flat or declining, overal growth rate stay in the 4% range.With MSFT stock steadili appreci due almost sole to multipl appreciation, rather than earn growth, investor are clearli expect sale to pick up. But, it' import to rememb that Azur and Surfac won't be abl to drive that acceler on their own.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the Market5 Safe Dividend Stock to Buy for RetirementTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Still Reli on Offic and Windowsappear first onInvestorPlace."

Power Nap is a featur that let Mac laptop run basic background function such as retriev e-mail and instal softwar updates, while close and sleeping. By shift control of Power Nap from the Intel CPU to an ARM chip, less power is use and MacBook batteri would last longer.Whi the excit about the possibl of Appl make a complet switch and replac Intel processor with ARM CPU in Macs?ARM in Mac: The PayoffsTher are mani compel reasons, includingthos laid out last yearbi theMacObserver. ARM chip power all of Apple' mobil devices, so switch to ARM CPU in Mac would simplifi and unifi code develop between MacO and iOS.10 Compani That Are Bring Job Back to AmericaIntel ha move away from tick-tock processor develop cycles, so it may not be move forward fast enough for Apple' needs. Modern, 64-bit ARM processor are becom competit with Intel on power, includ the power need to run an oper system like Window in a virtual environment; therefore, ARM in Mac wouldn't have to mean Mac lose the option to runMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.Then there' cost.

It estim the cost of the A-seri chip use in the iPhon and iPad at roughli $25, while Intel CPU use in Mac were somewher in the $180 to $300 range.Th site point to the Appl TV as an exampl of Appl make the switch. The first gener ran a version of OS X on Intel processors. For the second generation, AAPL switch to an ARM-bas A4 chip run iOS. That move shrunk the Appl TV size and knock the price from $299 to $99. The number may have chang a littl sinc then, but the same basic math applies: ARM is consider cheaper.Wil Appl Ditch Intel?Ther would be mani risk in switch to ARM CPU in Macs. Even if AAPL did make that decision, it would still need Intel CPU for a number of year while it made the transit across the Mac product line - and Intel would be abl to stick it to Appl for those chips. There would be challeng around integr ARM chip with high-end graphic card like those made byNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Other third-parti hardwar would also requir work.Appl Inc.

If anything, they have to sinc the consequ of be wrong are so great! After all, a win for a short seller is if the stock goe to zero - which rare happens. But as seen with Nvidia shares, the downsid can be horrific.Th ironi is that short posit can provid tremend fuel for price appreciation. Keep in mind that short seller need to buy back share to close out their positions.Someth els to keep in mind: It' gener not a good strategi to take a short posit mere becaus the valuat is excessive. There are mani exampl of compani - likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) in the 1980 and 1990s, orAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) dure the past decad - that have sustain long bull runs. Wall Street is more than will to place premium on firm that can grow fast and with consistency.A for NVDA stock, the valuat is definit pricey.

For example, in the latest quarter, Nvidia reporteda sizzl 54% spike in revenuesto $2 billion and GAAP earn came to 83 cent a share, up 89%.The thing to keep in mind is that Nvidia is posit nice to benefit from variou megatrends, which should provid lot of room for growth. The company' deep experi with graphic process unit (GPUs), which allow for intens computations, is becom the elixir for cloud computing, artifici intelligence, virtual reality, self-driv car and gaming.

The compani ha built a full platform for so-cal AI car comput - call Nvidia Drive PX 2 - that use high-perform chip and softwar to detect surround as well as determin optim routes. Actually, there are over80 automak that use the system, includingTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).At the core of all of Nvidia' advantag in variou larg market is the company' focu on AI. For the most part, GPU have proven adept at thi type of advanc computing, which allow for trillion of deep learn transact per second. The result is that a system can quickli adapt and learn. So, thi mean a self-driv car will know where to turn or stop. Or it could mean that a corpor cloud system ha the abil to understand import trend or risks.Accord toInvestorPlace'sBrad Moon:""Becaus the GPU is design for one primari purpos - everyth includ comput graphic boil down to crunch number - NVDA is abl to produc them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equival perform level, while produc less heat and use less power.""Great, right?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weapon,2/2/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is often compar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which isn't alway accurate. Most notably, Alibaba doesn't hold inventori like it larger U.S. peer, and it doesn't have AMZN' massiv distribut capabilities. But, there is one notabl similar that doesn't seem price into BABA stock at the moment:makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA large, fast-grow cloud comput offering.Amazon' cloud business, call Amazon Web Servic (AWS), ha been a major factor in the rise of AMZN stock from less than $200 to more than $800 over the past five years.Alibaba Cloud is still much smaller, but it growth profil look much like that of AW back in 2011-12. That explos growth - and the abil to be a legitim competitor to Amazon.com andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) - ha the potenti to drive signific addit upsid in BABA stock.Th Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA StockSo far, the cloud busi hasn't done much for Alibaba' revenue, or BABA stock, for that matter. BABA still trade around $100, basic the same level at which it went public in late 2014.Through the first nine month of fiscal 2016, cloud ha gener just 3.3% of total revenue. Over the past four quarters, Alibaba' cloud sale total just $765 million - like less than 6% of what AW will creat in calendar 2016. And at the moment, Alibaba' cloud busi actual is a drag on BABA earnings. The busi ha lost $92 million in EBITA (not EBITDA; BABA use EBITA for segment income) over the past four quarters.3 BRIC Buy That Play Banking, Buy and ... Beef?But the gap to Amazon and the loss in the busi have more to do with Alibaba' rel late start than with a lack of demand. Cloud revenu growth ha been impressive, increas 130% through the first nine month of fiscal 2016, and 115% in the Decemb quarter, despit a price cut.That follow a 138% increas in cloud sale in fiscal 2016. Most impressively, the number of custom nearli doubl year-over-year in Q3, and BABA ad 114,000 new custom in the Decemb quarter alone.A for profitability, Alibaba isn't worried, yet, with manag say on the Q3 confer call it wa spend to gain market share. Profit will come, but for now, Alibaba is look to cement it domin of the lucr Chines market.Loss now are OK - AW lost money until recent - becaus those new custom will provid high-margin recur revenu go forward, possibl for decades.Th Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA Stock Go ForwardTh good news for BABA stock is that it look like the cloud busi is near an inflect point. Loss are narrowing, but still repres a drag on overal earn for BABA. Over the past 12 months, cloud ha actual had a neg impact on EP of about $0.03. That will chang shortly, as Alibaba ha said that the busi will hit a profit around 1 million users, a mileston almost certain to be hit in 2017.The question is what happen after that. If Alibaba' growth look anyth like Amazon' go forward, it should be veri posit for BABA stock.AMZN didn't break out cloud revenu until 2015; it appear that the busi gener about $1 billion in sale in 2011 and $2 billion in 2012. That then grew to almost $4 billion in 2013, $5.6 billion in 2014, and $7.9 billion in 2015. 2016 growth to date suggest a figur over $12 billion in 2016. AW is now estim by analyst to be worth (on it own) about $150-$160 billion.Can Alibaba grow it cloud busi to the same extent? Goldman Sach analyst argu it could,project a valuefor Alibaba Cloud of $42 billion by 2019, base on $5 billion in sales. That growth alon would add almost 20% to the valu of BABA stock over the next few year and it' not as outlandish as it seems.Th Futur Look Bright for BABA StockGrowth rate have been over 100%, yet cloud comput is still rel unknown in China. On the Q3 confer call, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang estim that, even assum price discount to lure custom use hard drives, the address market for cloud in China would be $30 billion. And in November, Alibaba ad new data center in four locat worldwide: Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai and Germany.Th concern might be whether a Chines compani will be abl to compet intern with Amazon and Microsoft. U.S. compani might prefer domest providers, and elsewher there could be worri about security.But, the revers of that argument is that Alibaba should have a huge advantag in market to Chines consumers, as those custom might be similarli unwil to use American compani for their cloud services. Even with BABA now worth approxim $250 billion, the $30 billion Chines market is more than enough to provid a materi catalyst.3 Stock to Buy for Better Deal Than the Great RecessionAW profit margin alreadi arenear 25%despit it own spend in that business. Assum Alibaba can get half of the Chines market at 30% margins, the cloud segment could contribut as much as $1.50 per share in EP annually, enough to add $30 billion-$40 billion in market value. Ani intern success would simpli add to that value.Until now, the busi hasn't been a focu of BABA stock investors, but that seem like to change. When the compani hit the 1 million mark and turn cloud profit in 2017, coverag of the busi should like increase. And, further awar of that driver seem equal like to drive upsid for BABA stock. Investor should consid get long in Alibaba stock befor the rest of the market figur that out.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruarySear Hold Corp (SHLD): A Great American Tragedi Near It EndTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Ha a Secret Weaponappear first onInvestorPlace."

3 Naked Puts on High-ROI Stocks,2/2/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsThi week I'm go to do someth a littl differ as I discuss nake puts. First, let' remind ourselv what we'r up to with nake puts, which will be an import piec of my forthcom stock advisori newsletter,Th Liberti Portfolio.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWith nake puts, you are sell the right for someon to ""put,"" or sell, the chosen stock to you at a certain price if the stock fall below that price on or befor a given date of expiration.It' unlik that the stock will get sold to you prior to that date even if share fall below the strike price. It is possible, but it onli tend to happen if the stock is well below the strike.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryNak put gener incom from the contract, and I onli sell them on stock I want to own, so I don't mind if they get put to me. I'll be calcul return a bit differ thi week.Nak Puts: Dollar Tree (DLTR)Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrDollar Tree, Inc.(NASDAQ:DLTR) is a massiv dollar retail store, and ha perform except well over the long term. It' had a recent selloff that I think present a great opportun to sell nake puts. DLTR close Wednesday at $76.39.Bi sell the 17 March $75 nake puts, assum you get $3.10 per contract, you get a ""raw real return"" of 4.06%, which is calcul by divid $3.10 by $76.39. Becaus the contract run 44 days, that come out to 33.7% annualized.Anoth way to calcul it is to assum DLTR stock is put to you, but that the stock is purchas use margin. Most broker have a 35% margin requir for an effect short posit - an amount set asid to partial cover the cost of a potenti purchase. So 35% of the total purchas price if DLTR were put to you is $2,625. Thus, what I would call the ""gross ROI"" would be $310 divid by $2,625, or 11.81%.Nake Puts: Starbuck (SBUX)Source:Javi González Via FlickrGross ROI is just anoth way to compar option trades. Let' look at anoth exampl with it and raw real return forStarbuck Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX).SBUX stock ha fallen the past few day on earn result that annoy some people, but it' a long-term stori and it mean be abl to get the stock at a cheaper price with nake puts.SBUX close Wednesday at $53.90. The 10 March $54 nake put are sell for about $1.10. So the raw real return here is 2.04%, which come out to 20.1% on an annual basis.3 ""Left for Dead"" Stock Make a ComebackTak our 35% margin requir on a $5,400 purchase, we come out to $1,890. Divid $110 into $1,890 give us a gross ROI of 5.82%.Nake Puts: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Finally, look atMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which close at $63.58 on Wednesday. The 10 March $63.50 nake put are sell for $1.35. On a raw real return basi that come out to 2.12%, or 20.9% on an annual basis. A 35% margin requir on a $6,350 purchas is $2,222. So our gross ROI is 6.07%.Now, compar all three. Note that the more volatil stock, DLTR, offer a higher premium but also sell at a higher price. Even though DLTR stock is onli $13 more expens than MSFT stock, or about 20%, and the contract is onli one week longer, the premium sell for 130% more, thu creat a higher gross ROI.SBUX stock is about 20% cheaper than MSFT stock, yet both it raw real return and gross ROI are about the same. The purpos of thi exercis is just to show a differ way to calcul a return should a stock get put to you, and you elect to actual purchas it instead of just buy back the nake position.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

"Microsoft Sells ""Thousands"" of HoloLens -- What Now?",2/2/2017,"Microsoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) HoloLen -- a ""mix reality"" headset which project virtual and augment realiti ""holograms"" on real object -- captur the attent of mani gadget enthusiast last year, but the develop kit's$3,000 price tagkept it mostli in the hand of seriou developers.However, Microsoft recent announc that it had sold ""thousands"" of HoloLen unit sinc last March -- indic that develop base wa growing. Let' take a look at what lie in store for the HoloLen thi year, and when a cheaper consumer-fac model might final arrive.Imag source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();Th Window 10 Creator UpdateUnd CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft ha gradual built a ""One Windows"" ecosystem in which variou devic are connect by a singl oper system, app store, and cloud platform. HoloLen will play a crucial role in tether ""mix reality"" user to that ecosystem via Window 10.The first major step toward that integr will be the Window 10 Creator Updat thi spring. That updat will add 3D imag captur and edit tools, which will enabl artist and develop to creat 3D object which can be view in HoloLens. That learn curv sound steep, but Microsoft claim that the tool will be so simpl that they can be use by 12-year-olds. Do so could help Microsoft attract more develop to make Window 10 and HoloLen a truli ""holographic"" combination.Th virtual realiti train wheelsLast October, Microsoft announc that it would launchVR headsetsthat could track a user' head rotat and posit without use extern sensor likeFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculu Rift andHTC' Vive. Like the Rift and Vive, Microsoft' VR headset will be tether to PCs.But Microsoft' headset will start at just $300 -- significantli undercut the Rift and Vive' respect price tag of $600 and $800. Microsoft also claim that the headset will work on mid-rang PCs, which could pull PC gamer away from the Rift and Vive. Microsoft won't manufactur these headset on it own. Instead, it will reli on hardwar partner likeHP,Lenovo,Dell,Asus, andAcerto launch the devices.Thes headset will notabl use similar voic and gestur command as the HoloLens. Thi mean that they could serv as cheaper ""train wheels"" for the HoloLen -- so the control feel more familiar when the commerci version final arrives.Mor retail and enterpris partnershipsMicrosoft ha been boost the HoloLens' public exposur with sever retail partnerships.Volvous the HoloLen to let consum ""virtually"" custom their dream car in augment realiti -- regardless of a dealer' in-stor inventory. That virtual custom help dealer minim inventori space to reduc real estat expenses.Th HoloLen be use at a Volvo dealership. Imag source: Microsoft.Hom improv retailerLowe'slet custom use the HoloLen to view chang to their home in virtual reality. Microsoft will like sign similar retail partnership thi year, sinc they help both retail and custom understand the practic use of HoloLens' mix realiti features.Microsoft ha also sign enterpris deal with sever compani to test the HoloLens' effect in the workplace. It integr withAutodesk360 help design creat hologram version of their designs, and it partnership withTrimblestreamlin commun for construct worker and provid them with 3D visual of their projects.Japan Airlinesalso use the headset to train mechan and flight crew member last year. That list will like grow thi year if the Creator Updat whet companies' appetit for holograph applications.But don't expect a consum releas in 2017Microsoft is lay down the foundat for the HoloLens, but consum shouldn't expect a cheaper version of the devic to arriv thi year. Alex Kipman, who overse the develop of the HoloLens, recent toldCNETthat he doesn't expect hardwar price to significantli declin anytim soon. Kipman admit that ""roadmaps"" for get the price under $1,000 exist, but he declin to share ani addit details.It' veri common for a devic to have a long wait time between develop kit releas and the commerci launch. Oculus, for example, releas the first dev kit of the Rift in March 2013. The commerci version didn't arriv until three year later. Therefore, we could still need to wait averylong time befor a cheaper HoloLen arrives.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?,2/1/2017,"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent announc that it will invest over $1 billion per year on cybersecur research and development. That amount, which is equival to roughli 8% of it R&D spend over the past 12 months, doesn't includ ani acquisit that Microsoft might make. Let' see whi Microsoft is beef up it cybersecur efforts, and what that could mean for smaller player across the fragment industry.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecur mean to MicrosoftMicrosoft' Window is the most wide use PC oper system in the world, Offic is the most popular product suite, and Azur is the second largest cloud platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of thi massiv ecosystem ha tradit been protect by third parti companies. Microsoft' own product -- like Window Firewall, Window Defender, and Microsoft Secur Essenti -- were often consid inferior to third-parti ones.However, Microsoft' ecosystem ha becom more cohes under CEO Satya Nadella' ""One Windows"" strategy, which aim to instal the same OS and app store across multipl platforms. Sinc user would ideal download app from the Window Store and deliv their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logic to add first-party, self-upd secur solut across the entir ecosystem. Microsoft claim that the number of weekli cyber attack ha risen from 20,000 to as mani as 700,000 over the past two to three years.To counter those threat while expand it ecosystem, Microsoft acquir three Isra cybersecur firm over the past two year -- enterpris secur start-up Aorato, cloud secur firm Adallom, and data protect firmSecur Islands. Those acquisit and it plan R&D invest could help Azur challeng AWS, which alreadi integr an arsen of secur featur into it cloud infrastructur platform. Azure' revenu surg 93% annual last quarter, but Microsoft hasn't reveal it exact sale figur yet.How thi could hurt smaller playersA Microsoft' cybersecur ecosystem grows, it could overlap with the servic of mani smaller stand-alon third-parti players. For example, Microsoft recent launch Window Defend ATP (Advanc Threat Protection) for Window 10. That endpoint servic match event with Microsoft' cloud-bas Secur Graph, which gather data across over a billion Window devic worldwide. It also work with Microsoft' email protect servic from Offic 365 and Microsoft Advanc Threat Analytics.Thi platform directli compet against ""perimeter"" player like threat prevent firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewal vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . Dure last year' RSA Conference, Microsoft princip research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Window Defend ATP can ""help captur network traffic out of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks"" as FireEy and other threat detect services.Consid what $1 billion mean to these smaller cybersecur companies. Palo Alto and FireEy are expect to respect gener $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenu thi year -- so there' no way that they could match Microsoft' R&D investments. Windows, Offic 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other platform all give Microsoft the abil to bundl and scale up it cybersecur servic veri quickly. It can also offer lower price and offset those loss across other part of it ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecur firm could still surviveMicrosoft' grow interest in the cybersecur market could render some smaller player obsolete, but ""best in breed"" player like FireEy and Palo Alto have surviv similar assault from bundl player before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, ha aggress bundl threat prevent and next-gen firewal into it network hardwar and software. Yet FireEy still serv 5,000 custom across 67 countries, which includ nearli half of the Forb Global 2000. Palo Alto serv over 35,500 custom in more than 140 countries, includ 80 of the Fortun 100 and half of the Global 2000.Those number indic that compani will like valu a company' track record and reput over the conveni of cheaper bundles. They also indic that it could be smarter for Microsoft to either acquir or partner with smaller stand-alon player instead of tri to render them obsolete.Th key takeawayBeef up it cybersecur busi will help Microsoft counter Amazon and tighten up it ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While some of the new featur seem destin to crush third-parti secur players, investor should rememb that compani will like stick with ""best in breed"" player instead of the cheapest bundle, and a mass switch to a new secur platform can be costli and time consuming.Therefore, investor in cybersecur compani should be mind of Microsoft' ambitions, but they should rememb that mani ""best in breed"" compani have weather similar attack from compani like Cisco before.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future,2/1/2017,"When you regularli give your opinion on someth as unpredict as financi markets, gloat when you get someth right is rare a good idea. That is especi true when those opinion arearchivedfor all to see; it' too easi for a reader to check out that archiv and find exampl of when the market and hindsight combin to make even logic argument seem foolish. I am fulli awar of that, but when it come to yesterday’searn releas from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What realli matter about the Appl releas to investor is certainli not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant return to growth in revenu for the first time in a year, nor that the alreadi great margin at Appl increased. Those last two are important, but necessarili backward looking, as all hard data in an earn releas are by definition.What matter most is what the report tell us about the futur and there the messag wa somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();Th offici guidanc for Q1 2017 contain in the releas fell just short of Wall Street’ expectations, which would normal be enough of a neg to more than offset the good histor results. In thi case, though, a look at where Appl succeed in Q4 2016 suggest that that guidanc may just be anoth exampl of Apple’ past tendenc to err on the side of under-promis and over-deliv when it come to guidance. That is why, even though growth stall last year, AAPL ha beaten EP expect in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhon sale hit anoth record. That is particularli signific as not that long ago mani were predict that Googl parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’ move into the phone busi would do Appl some seriou harm. It look now as if those say that were about as accur as those that maintain that the Window phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.Th fact is that the iPhon ha an icon statu that look almost imposs to challenge. Even phone that are object better in some ways, such as memori capacity, camera resolution, or speaker qualiti for example, cannot take market share. As Appl advanc the iPhon with each release, beat them on those and other front becom harder, but remains, accord to the evid so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynam remains, hold Appl stock and ad to hold at time of weak still make sens for investors.Th weak in thi releas wa mainli in one area; iPad sale declin for the twelfth success quarter. That, however, wa offset to some extent by strong sale of Mac and Appl Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Appl doesn’t releas a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I point out in the articl referenc above, anybodi who tri to buy a Seri Two watch as a Christma gift is probabl awar that sale were at least more than Appl expected. None were avail in ani of the five state where I tri and most store have just now receiv inventory.That shortag of watches, combin with Cook’ admiss that they serious underestim demand for the iPhon 7 Plus, mean that the record sale report yesterday were achiev with a background of suppli constraints. Given that and the fact that there wa consider growth in area such as servic and enterpris oper that still have lot of room for Appl to expand, the messag underli yesterday’ earn is that, despit convent wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

Appl set an all-tim quarterli revenu record - snap it streak of declin - and broke it previou iPhon sale record. AAPL stock is up strongli Wednesday morn as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday' show wasn't the iPhone. It wa the Servic division, which includ the App Store, Appl Pay, iTunes, AppleCar and Appl Music. Servic didn't just set anoth record - it also post the strongest year-over-year growth of ani AAPL division.Servic Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreAppl report that the quarterli revenu for it Servic divis top $7.17 billion for Q1, an increas of 18% compar to the previou year. If that sound like a lot of money for what is larg made up of mobil payment transact fee and digit content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienc it largest-ev subscrib growth in the final quarter of 2016, lead it to post revenu of $2.48 billion.Dur the AAPL earn confer call, CEO Tim Cook note that he expect the Servic divis to beth size of a Fortun 100 compani by the end of the year. Other key inform about the Servic divis from that earn call includes:App Store revenu for Decemb alon wa a record-set $3 billionTher are now 2.2 million app in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to develop in 2016The number of Appl Pay user ha tripl over the past year, with transact volum up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCar and storag servic (iCloud) both set all-tim recordsApple' music busi grew for the third straight quarterWhi Servic Revenu is ImportantY might not know it base on Apple' record-set iPhon sale thi quarter, but sell hardwar is tough.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryOnc a consum ha an iPhon in hi or her hands, it becom veri difficult to convinc them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphon for a new one. In one sense, a huge instal user base - which AAPL has, withmor than 1 billion iO devic in activ use- work against the company. When the iPhon first began to take off, AAPL wa sell to peopl who'd never own one before. Now, that pool of easi sale is dwindling. And Appl is left in the tougher posit of convinc it instal user base to upgrade.Thu the hand-wring about slow iPhon sales.Apple' Servic divis larg benefit from that huge instal user base, though. True, AAPL onli get one shot at sell these custom AppleCare. But onc they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Appl Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explor Apple' other services. They are increasingli adopt Appl Pay. They are in a prime posit to buy movi on their Appl TV. They are perfect candid to subscrib to Appl Music. There are plenti of hook for store data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of it million of apps.Apple' Servic revenu doesn't come in big chunk like sell an iPhone. It' $9.99 a month here, 99 cent for an app there, a few cent for a transaction. But it add up, especi when over a billion custom are gener it.Mor importantly, that revenu doesn't drop off the same way hardwar revenu doe when peopl stop buy new iPhones.Som servic - like iCloud and Appl Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keep automat bill the customer' card everi month regardless of whether their iPhon is brand new or five year old. Appl Pay revenu are increas as more countri and busi accept it and iPhon owner grow more accustom to use it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeopl never stop buy apps. They may slow down after the initi rush of a new device, but develop keep bring entic new game and other app to the App Store. That mean the 1 billion user continu to download.Trad of the Day: Appl Inc.

No one know for sure, but odd are it won't be mani more than it doe now. On the other hand, Appl is confid it highfli App Store, Appl Pay and other servic will see Servic divis revenu doubl in that time.Th iPhon may have driven Appl stock growth over the past decade.

And whi not? FB stock ha been a pretti good bet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut could thing be differ thi time around? Mayb the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carri away?Well, it is import to note that the valuat is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earn ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. Thi compar to roughli 20X for bothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). And these compani are not grow at anywher near the pace of Facebook.What' more, it seem like Facebook earn should do fine in Q4. Revenu are expect to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjust EP are forecast to come to $1.31, up from 79 cent dure the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarter - the compani ha beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.FB Stock Still Face Sever RisksBut the real potenti issu for Facebook stock is ani disappoint commentari on the futur growth trends. Interestingli enough, on the Q3 earn call, the company' CFO had thi omin thing tosay: ""We continu to expect that revenu growth rate will declin in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continu to expect that our total payment and other fee revenu in Q4 will be lower than it wa in the fourth quarter of last year.""10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatNo doubt, thi should not be a surprise. As FB get much larger, it will increasingli get more difficult to churn out strong revenu numbers. It' the curs of the so-cal ""law of larg numbers.""Let' face it, Facebook alreadi ha a massiv user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthli activ user hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stun 1.2 billion daili users.But go forward, what will the sourc of new user be? It' hard to tell. But initi from FB show concerns. After all, the compani ha been work hard to provid internet access to develop nations.And don't forget about China. Accord to a report from theWal Street Journal, it appear that Facebook ha made littl progress. Instead, rival likeWeibo Corp(ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTencent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have been capit on the opportunity.At the same time, other problem could affect FB stock. For example, dure the last few months, there have been variou embarrass stori about how the compani ha inflat certain metrics. Might thi caus some pushback from advertisers?Th Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)?Then there is the ""fake news"" controversy. Granted, the compani ha taken action to improv the publish of news, such as with a focu on credibl sources. But thi could result in lower click and views, which would slow down the revenu momentum for Facebook stock.Someth els that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcom Snapchat IPO, which should hit the market within the next coupl of months. Of course, there will be tremend buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevit comparison to FB. In other words, investor may look at Snapchat as an altern to Facebook stock when seek the next growth play.Overall, Wednesday' earn announc will definit be important.

For example, Window 10 Pro for Workstat and Window 10 for Enterpris are spike out. Noth unusu there. But then, refer to Window 10 Cloud began to appear. And that start rais eyebrow - what is Window 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMari Jo Foley put the piec togeth yesterday. Quot unnam sources, she say that the mysteri Window 10 Cloud is a new, simplifi version of Microsoft Window that will run onli Unifi Window Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it' a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Window 10.You might also think of it as anoth crack at Window RT …Window RT? But Why?Everyon rememb the mess that wasWindow RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Window onto a consum tablet run ARM chip -the ill-fat Surfac RT - veri nearli dealt MSFT' tablet aspir a fatal blow.However, despit the failur of Window RT, Microsoft ha never given up on the idea of Window on ARM chips. By do so, it can get Window onto mobil devic that can't use the more power and expens chip fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The compani ha alreadi been show offWindow 10 run in emul on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be work on a ""lite"" version that can deliv much of the Window 10 experi on less expensive, lower power ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk fall flat on it face again with what essenti amount to anoth crack at Window RT? There are two reasons.Th first is that dream of ""Window everywhere."" Have the full Window 10 experi on high-pow ARM chip is great, but onli flagship smartphon and tablet can afford to use those chips. Window 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Window (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobil hardware.Th second is Google' Chrome OS and Chromebooks.

And Chromebook have just kept selling, to the point where last year they pass evenAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBook in sales.Microsoft ha tri fight back by help manufactur put out cheap Window 10 laptops, but that hasn't stem the Chromebook flood. Window 10 make for a sluggish experi on inexpens Intel hardware, it' far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lack the drop-dead easi secur of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Befor EarningsWindow 10 Cloud run on laptop with ARM processor would compet head-to-head with Chromebook run Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Window 10.Microsoft refus to comment on theZDNetpost, but the piec point to Window 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Window RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is go to avoid all refer to Window RT - that' poison - and the Window 10 Cloud name could end up be a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder.

4 Reasons I'm Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR) Stock,1/31/2017,"Chines search giantBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) is often dismiss as a slow-growth tech stock that ha run out of room to grow. It heavi invest in expand it ecosystem into adjac market have weigh down it bottom line growth, make the stock seem like dead money. Despit those challenges, however, I recent start a new posit in Baidu for four main reasons.Baidu Imag Search. Imag source: Author' screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. It' still the 800-pound gorillaBaidu control roughli 80% of the internet search market in China. That domin posit enabl it to expand it ecosystem in the same way asAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. It sprawl ecosystem now includ Baidu Maps, video stream site iQiyi, it Duer voic assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numer portal sites, and variou O2O (online-to-offline) servic in it ""monolithic"" mobil app.Whil the profit of these servic vari greatly, they all help Baidu gather data from it user for target ads. Last quarter, Baidu' revenu per onlin market custom rose 10.6% annually. Thi indic that Baidu still remain a top advertis pick in China, even as other popular app -- likeTencent' WeChat -- tether more user to their ecosystems. Moreover, China still ha an internet penetr rate of just 52%, which mean that there may be plenti of room for all these compani to expand without step on each other' toes.2. It slowdown is temporaryBaidu fell out of favor with growth investor as it top and bottom line growth seemingli dri up. Last quarter, it revenu fell 0.7% annually, it core onlin market revenu slid 6.7%, and it non-GAAP net incom rose just 6.3%. Analyst expect it revenu to rise 6% thi year, but for it earn to declin 9%.However, that slowdown wa mainli caus by three temporari headwinds. First, Chines regul forc Baidu to remov mislead pharmaceut ad follow the death of a student who bought unapprov cancer drug advertis on the site. Second, Baidu sold it stake in onlin travel agencyQunarto it rivalCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , essenti swap it stake in Qunar for one in Ctrip but temporarili throttl revenu growth.Lastly, Baidu' heavi invest in R&D are squeez it margins, but launch new servic could boost it long-term growth and widen it moat against rival like Tencent. That' whi analyst believ that Baidu' revenu and earn will respect rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017.3. Growth potenti in next-gen marketsLik Google, Baidu is invest heavili in artifici intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies. Machin learn and AI have becom increasingli import to search and advertis companies, sinc they help gather more data from user to creat target ad that user are more like to click on. Baidu ha been hire a lot of top talent in that field -- it chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previous led the Googl Brain AI project, and it new augment realiti chief Qi Lu wa aMicrosoftexec special in AI.To showcas it AI efforts, Baidu pit it AI robot against Google' AlphaGo AI in a battl of facial and voic recognit in earli January. It partner withNVIDIAand HERE Map to develop map system for autonom vehicles, and plan to launch a driverless shuttl bu in China in 2018. It also partner with smart remot maker Peel to establish a foothold in the grow smart home market. These project won't gener meaning revenu for years, but they could greatli expand Baidu' O2O ecosystem over the long term.4. The stock is still cheapBaidu current trade at just 13 time earnings, which is much lower than Google' P/E of 31 and the industri averag of 50 for internet inform providers. But due to it project declin in earn thi year, the stock ha a forward P/E of 30. While that forward multipl doesn't seem cheap, we should rememb that Baidu' earn are expect to rebound in 2017.The key takeawayBaidu will like remain weigh down by near-term challeng over the next few quarters, but it' still well-posit to profit from the long-term growth of the Chines internet market. Baidu may struggl to pull social user away from Tencent and shopper away fromAlibaba, but it domin of the search-bas ad market won't end anytim soon.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It wa also veri popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphon and tablet, are often preferred. However, overal the bigger and more expens iPhon 6 Plu onli account foraround 20% of overal iPhon salesglobally.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL ad a littl more appeal to the bigger iPhone, ad increas RAM to the optic imag stabil camera for the iPhon 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sale of the bigger model.Last year, Appl roll the dice: It decid to releas a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrad that it heavili promot as a must-hav feature. With thi advanc camera system, user could take DSLR-like portrait and optic zoom in on subjects. AAPL made thi key featur an iPhon 7 Plu exclusive, at the same time boost the price of it larger iPhone. Previously, it had charg $649 and $749 respect for the two sizes. In 2016, the compani still start the iPhon 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphon featur requir shell out at least $769 for the iPhon 7 Plus.iPhon 7 Sale See Big Increas in iPhon 7 Plu AdoptionTheWal Street Journali report that Apple' iPhon 7 Plu strategi appear to have paid off. Cite number from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creativ Strategi Inc., theWSJsay that in AAPL' first quarter (end in December), theiPhon 7 Plu is estim to have account for 40% of total iPhon 7 sales, globally.Break the number down regionally, it' estim that 52% of Chines iPhon buyer opt for the more expens iPhon 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it account for 47% of total iPhon 7 sales.Whi Increas iPhon 7 Plu to iPhon 7 Sale MatterTh differ between the two iPhon model is materi to AAPL' bottom line.Appl Inc. New iPad Might Be Late to the Parti (AAPL)It' like that the iPhon 7 Plu cost Appl more to manufactur than previou Plu version - it doe have more RAM, a larger batteri and that dual camera system - but at least some of the addit cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Appl on the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu probabl remain roughli the same. However, with a base price that' $120 higher, have more Plu model in the mix mean that even if overal iPhon 7 sale are soft, the averag sell price of a new iPhon goe up. As a result, iPhon revenu could get a boost, despit sale that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticl point out, there' anoth posit point for AAPL in the iPhon 7 Plu numbers.

Sign Up for Free Profits From Facebook Inc (FB) Stock,1/30/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI recent wrote uptwo bullish trade to profit fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). Luckily, I caught an uptrend and the profit came quickli so I book them. Thi week I want to reset to tri and repeat perform - but thi time I have an earn report to worri about.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTrad are fickl around earnings. The short-term reaction to an earn report is more gambl than investing, regardless of the qualiti of the report. Often enough great compani stock come under sell pressur even on solid reports.FB stock is a mega cap and usual they take cue from other mega cap earn reactions. We recent saw a split decis betweenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Eventu these compani are winners; they are beast with littl chanc of debacles. But for the short term, investor have to contend with the knee-jerk reactions.Hav said that, there are way I can trade earn report without much out-of-pocket risk. Last week I sold put in MSFT to buy it calls. The trade wa an easi win.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatThi week, I will set up a trade to benefit from a posit reaction to FB' earnings. Expert think that Wall Street will not be impress by what FB stock manag ha to report and that the risk is to the downside. I want to bet on the opposit but without much immedi risk.FB Stock TradesClick to EnlargeTh Trade:Buy Facebook Mar $135 calls. Thi is a bullish trade for which I pay $3 per contract to open. To profit, I need FB stock to ralli past my strike befor mid March. I could chang thi trade to a debit call spread to lower the entri cost. So I would instead buy the $135/$140 debit call spread and onli spend $1.40 per contract. The trade-off is that with the spread, I cap my maximum profit to $3.60 per contract.I usual like to lower my entri cost especi when volatil is high so I need to cautious sell options.Th Bank:Sel the Facebook Dec $100 put. Thi is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.80 per contract. Thi trade ha an 85% theoret chanc of success and a 18% price buffer from current price.I onli sell nake put if I am will and abl to own the stock at the strike sold. IF FB stock fall below $100 per share thi year I would be put the stock. Anyth lower than $96 per share would be loss for me.Th Twist:Sel nake put is not suit for everi risk profile. So I can chang the bank trade to be a credit put spread instead. Sell a spread make the trade' maximum risk finite. For example, I can sell the FB Dec $100/$95 credit put spread. I collect $1.06 per contract to open. If successful, thi trade yield 22% on money risked.Whi Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Be ScrewedThi is one of those occas where I could do either or both.

Collect that bid as the premium repres a 2.1% return against the $57.50 commitment, or a 4.5% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to MSFT' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corpor see it share fall 11.7% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $56.27 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the $1.23 from $57.50), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 4.5% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annual 4.5% figur actual exce the 2.4% annual dividend paid by Microsoft Corpor by 2.1%, base on the current share price of $65.13.

Ani upsid abov $70 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but MSFT share would have to climb 7.5% from current level for that to occur, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 9.6% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Microsoft Corporation, highlight in green where the $57.50 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $70 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Juli put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Fre Report) for one ha strongli resist govern demand as have Appl (NASDAQ:AAPL-Fre Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report). Alphabet' (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Fre Report) Googl ha also been vocal in it opposition. It make perfect sens when you consid that these are some of the biggest cloud comput stock that also offer comput and other devices. So they have vest interest at both end of the networks.Oth player with similar interest are chip maker like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Fre Report); network compani like Cisco and Juniper; and software/servic compani like IBM and Oracle.Here' a brief glimps of three cloud compani that just report Decemb quarter results:IntelIntel' result thi quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength wa season and unlik to be sustained.Although non-volatil memori had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger thi year, it current contribut a lower share of revenue, which equat to fewer increment dollars. Also, the busi is pois to benefit from Intel' strength in the server market.Data center revenu growth of 8% year over year wa help by platform volum growth of 3% and platform price increas of 4%. Intel ha new product in the pipelin and will also be integr some technolog it acquir through Altera, so thi year may be less disappoint than the last when enterpris soft skew expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft ha becom a cloud-focus company, impress analyst and investor alike.

In fact after the Decemb quarter result some analyst have start say that Microsoft ha also start pull away from the pack in it chase of Amazon.Alphabet' growth should not be discount howev becaus while cloud and hardwar are lump togeth right now, it common knowledg that most of it new hardwar ha been unavail for a lot of the time.

And it' no secret that Microsoft realli isdoinga lotof thingsrightthes days. Large-cap stock don't post market-crush 55% return in two year for no reason.That be said, I would like to argu that the Microsoft you see today is mile remov from the $500 billion beast you knew 17 year ago.makeArticleAd();Horac Chow, Microsoft' gener manag of Hong Kong operations, illustr ""transformation"" on stage. Imag source: Microsoft.Infl dollar valuesFirst, let me point out that $500 billion ain't what it use to be. The inexor march of inflat hollow out the valu of your dollar over time, and 17 year of that action can do a lot of damage. To wit:Th buy power of $500 billion in 2016 dollar work out to just $363 billion of inflation-adjust 2000 currency.Conversely, $500 billion then is the equival of roughli $697 billion in today' dollars.From thi perspective, Microsoft would need a market cap boost of 37% from today' total in order to make up for the inflat effect.Okay, nobodi set up mileston and goalpost at $697 billion. We want nice, round numbers. But if you don't consid inflation-bas eros over the long run, you'r do a disservic to your investments.It' real.Anoth yardstickMarket cap is the easi way out. You simpli multipli current share price by the number of share outstanding. Handi for discuss and popular at everi cocktail party, market cap is one of those metric you can lean on for quick comparisons.But it' also an overli simplist measur in mani ways. Let' say you actual want to buy all of Microsoft. You (or the cabal of multi-billionair and cash-rich compani you'r work with) would then have to take over all of Microsoft' debts, becaus lender and bondhold won't just drop their claim when the takeov happens. On the upside, you also get to keep all of Microsoft' cash equivalents, which is kind of like buy a nice wallet and find a hundred-dollar bill inside.Now we'r look at theenterpris valueinstead. The market cap is just a start point, follow by ad the company' debt balanc and subtract it cash reserves. Thi (plu an appropri buyout premium) would be the true price tag in a takeover.A it turn out, Microsoft come with more cash equival than debt. Today, thi metric stop at $459 billion -- a few buck short of the magic $500 billion waterline. Here' how Redmond' enterpris valu ha develop over the last 17 year compar to the simpler market cap:MSFT Market Capdata byYCharts.But wait, there' more!Honestly, there' alway more to say about a busi as complex as Microsoft. I'm not here to write a book today, so let' keep thi short and sweet.Befor I go, let me just point out that Microsoft ha done a lot of grow up sinc the dot-com boom and bust. Trail sale have nearli quadrupled, while free cash flow doubled:MSFT Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.Th company' dividend polici is just 13 year old, but now provid a decent 2.4% yield. And Microsoft' balanc sheet wa free of long-term debt 17 year ago, but that chang in 2009. The current statement of financi account ha veri littl in common with the lean, low-capit version it wield in 2000. Cash and debt balanc have skyrocket in recent years, and Microsoft ha start amass a gener chunk of plant, property, and equip asset (PP&E in the chart below).If I didn't know better, thi almost look like the balance-sheet antic of an industri manufactur conglomerate:MSFT Net PP&E (Quarterly)data byYCharts.Meet the new boss, not the same as the old bossAni way you slice it, the rejuven version ofMicrosoft sharesfew characterist with the older owner of a $500 billion market cap.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business,1/27/2017,"Surfac lineup. Imag source: Microsoft.WhenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launch itsSurfac lineup in 2012, I had my doubt as to whether or not the compani could success jump into hardware. The compani ha had it fair share of misstep for the Surface, but it' safe to say at thi point that Microsoft ha exceed most earli expect for it first-parti devices. Microsoft ha adapt quickli to flop like Surfac RT, which result in a $900 million writedown back in 2013, and push forward with expand the portfolio, most recent with Surfac Studio.makeArticleAd();Surfac revenu dure the fourth quarter came in at $1.3 billion, repres a sequenti increas of over 40% for the busi holiday shop season. That' enough to bring full-year 2016 Surfac revenu to an impress $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar year shown.It also probabl help that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger leader than hi predecessor, even though the Surfac strategi wa conceiv under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surfac hardwar creat a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also contribut to Ballmer' ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDur the earn call, Nadella note that Surfac ha enjoy three consecut quarter of 25%-plu growth. Sale mix is transit toward the newer product like Surfac Pro 4 and Surfac Book, and Surfac 3 sale are expect to continu wind down.Th custom recept for Surfac Studio in particular ha been strong, which is especi impress for two reasons: Surfac Studio wa not wide avail dure the fourth quarter, and it' extrem expensive, start at $3,000. Inventori for the new all-in-on should start improv thi quarter as product ramp up.Tak a bite out of AppleMor broadly, Surfac is but part of a bigger push among the Window PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surfac is do well, but it wa never expect to compris a larg chunk of the Window ecosystem; that' what origin equip manufactur (OEMs) are for.CFO Ami Hood said that Microsoft' ""OEM non-pro perform should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium devic category."" In other words, high-end consumer-ori PC made by Microsoft' partner are gain traction in the market, at a time when Appl lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Appl report fourth-quart result next week). OEM non-pro revenu grew 5% last quarter, outpac the broader PC market.Surfac is profitable, tooIt' also worth point out that Surfac is now profit on a gross margin basi (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so those revenu gain are start to enjoy some oper leverage.Unfortunately, currenc headwind are advers impact profitability, as Surfac gross margin wa up 17% on a constant currenc basi in dollar terms. There' a big discrep between the currenc impact on revenu (2 percentag points) compar to gross margin (11 percentag points), which is due to the fact that Surfac devic are manufactur in Asia and the Surfac cost structur is more vulner to currenc fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for be abl to take a struggl segment conceiv under Ballmer and turn it into a profit $4.3 billion busi within just a coupl of years.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

MicrosoftMSFTfor one ha strongli resist govern demand as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl ha also been vocal in it opposition. It make perfect sens when you consid that these are some of the biggest cloud comput stock that also offer comput and other devices. So they have vest interest at both end of the networks.Oth player with similar interest are chip maker like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanc Micro DevicesAMD; network compani like Cisco and Juniper; and software/servic compani like IBM and Oracle.Here' a brief glimps of three cloud compani that just report Decemb quarter results:IntelIntel' result thi quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength wa season and unlik to be sustained.Although non-volatil memori had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger thi year, it current contribut a lower share of revenue, which equat to fewer increment dollars. Also, the busi is pois to benefit from Intel' strength in the server market.Data center revenu growth of 8% year over year wa help by platform volum growth of 3% and platform price increas of 4%. Intel ha new product in the pipelin and will also be integr some technolog it acquir through Altera, so thi year may be less disappoint than the last when enterpris soft skew expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft ha becom a cloud-focus company, impress analyst and investor alike.

In fact after the Decemb quarter result some analyst have start say that Microsoft ha also start pull away from the pack in it chase of Amazon.Alphabet' growth should not be discount howev becaus while cloud and hardwar are lump togeth right now, it common knowledg that most of it new hardwar ha been unavail for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in thi segment seem to be less on account of hardwar sale and more of an indic of strength it is see in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat ha said that cloud, hardwar and YouTub subscript will be ""major revenu driver for Googl in the next sever years.""

Googl has, however, begun to show strength is it “Other Bets” — a segment that includ autonom vehicles, virtual/aug realiti headsets, it cloud busi and, more recently, it smartphones. Revenu in that group came in at $262 million, surg 75% year over year from $150 million a year ago.Google’ cost-per-click, a key metric determin the valu of an ad, fell 11% year-over-year thi quarter.

Sinc late June, Microsoft stock is up by about 33%.For the quarter, earn grew by 3.6% year-over-year to 79 cent a share and revenu improv 2.2% to reach $25.3 billion. That' good for a small beat on the top line, and an analyst match on the bottom line.Her are some of the highlight of the Microsoft earn report:Th compani return $6.5 billion in buyback and dividends.Revenu in the Product and Busi Process rose 10% to $7.4 billion.Revenu for the Offic consum product and cloud servic jump 22%There are no 24.9 million Offic 365 consum subscribers.Revenu for the cloud-bas Azur busi soar 93%.Thi stori ha been updated.Microsoft Stock and The Cloud OpportunityOv the past few years, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ha been doubl down on the cloud market, where there' plenti of room for growth. Accord to Gartner, total global spend is forecast to increas from $204 billion in 2016 to $318 billion by 2019.7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 2018The ironi is that the main rival for MSFT isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which current domin the cloud market.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) have been notabl laggards, but they'r ramp up their efforts.For holder of Microsoft stock, it is import to note that the success with the cloud ha not been just about be earli to the game. MSFT ha some some incred advantages, such as a trust brand, years' of experi with mission-crit system and a global infrastructure.What' more, Microsoft ha been smart and aggress about acquisitions.

"Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",1/26/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it' been an unpleas 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock final reach a new all-tim high last month. Despit the tech world chang drastic in the ensu years, Microsoft' PC domin live on, mint money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart Via FlickrTh company' variou new effort over the year have mostli been flops. There' a reason Microsoft stock ha perform poorly; effort such as Window phone simpli haven't pan out. However, it seem Microsoft ha final turn the corner.It is make real headway in sever promis areas, includ it cloud offering. And investor have cheered, send Microsoft' stock up sharpli sinc 2013. Can the good time continue, or will buyer up at these level be in for anoth long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHug Stock Run-Up: Sinc 2013, MSFT stock ha more than doubled. At first glance, that seem fine, the market ha perform strongli in recent year after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becom hard to achiev further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more doubl take Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It' worth ask what the compani ha go from a growth perspect that could justifi such a lofti figure.Sure, the compani ha some growth initi under way. The cloud offer is go well. And the LinkedIn acquisit may start to bear more fruit. But after watch the stock run from under 30 in recent year to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upsid realli make sense, particularli sinc the compani ha had near non-exist revenu growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First thing first, MSFT stock isn't realli trade at a 30 price-earn ratio. I know that' what financi websit report. However, that' base on GAAP figur that includ one-off loss relat to restructuring. On an adjust basis, Microsoft is trade in the mid-20s, and at 21 time forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flatter pictur for the company. Microsoft trade at 12 time earn or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth pay twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market ha stabilized, but it isn't like to ever be a meaning growth driver again. And the newer initi such as cloud seem like to take year to reach strong profitability. At 21 time forward earnings, MSFT stock is price in some seriou growth prospect that may well not materialize.Question Deal-Making:Microsoft ha a reput for make some head-scratch M&A moves. The less said of the aQuant purchas and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alon result in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal rais questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offer a massiv premium to where share where trade previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offer around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earn basis, LinkedIn wa still lose money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some cost there, particularli for stock-bas compensation, but it' still a massiv price tag. And with Microsoft have such a huge war chest on it balanc sheet, the temptat will sure be there for the compani to make other huge value-destruct deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quit a few year now, the tradit PC market appear to be in seriou decline. Sale peak in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Sinc then, sale have plunged. By 2015, sale drop 24% from that peak year, fall to just 275 million units. And 2016 show anoth solid decline, with sale reach just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 project are for 250 million unit sold, onli a fraction declin from current levels.And themost recent datasupport thi further moderation: sale slip just 1.5% versu the same period last year. And in sever area globally, includ Canada and Japan, PC sale are actual increas again. One possibl reason, the rate of forward technolog progress ha slow for both tablet and smartphones, reduc pressur on consum to switch to smaller screens. A stabl market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft ha partner withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Thing efforts. Qualcomm ha enter conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use it chip to even forc attack Intel' long-held domin in the PC market. In ani case, Microsoft benefit nice from partner up with Qualcomm.Th IoT offer born from thi ventur will help spread Window 10 outsid of just the tradit PC market. And given the shellack that QCOM stock took earlier thi week followingAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm ha reason to deepen tie with friendli partners. As an industri outcast, Qualcomm need whatev help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Window as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft ha quietli turn into a nice yield choic for more conserv investors. The compani ha tripl it dividend sinc 2008. In total, it' post 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rate over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio current look a littl high, that' base on abnorm soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenti of room left here for more dividend increases. The compani ha an astound $137 billion in cash on it balanc sheet. Even after subtract out debt, the compani ha a net cash posit of $62 billion, leav plenti of firepow for increas dividends, share buyback or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent select if you'r pure concern with it yield and safety. The company' main PC busi is look healthier than it ha in quit awhile. The balanc sheet is tremendous. The dividend is signific at today' level, and is bound to keep rise quickly.Here' Whi Chevron Corpor (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there' littl to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft ha plenti of growth initi in the works, but actual oper result recent have onli been so-so. When buy stock at all-tim highs, you want to see a busi with more oper momentum.At the time of thi writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no posit in Microsoft.

It' the potenti for success in those product that ha offset fear about continu pressur on revenu from Windows, as PC sale declin and mobil usag increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 ha come mostli from the transition.Th fear of Window loss that led MSFT stock to be valu around 10x EP in 2013 have turn to optim toward growth in Azure, Offic 365, Enterpris Mobil and other areas. That optim ha push the same stock to be valu at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seem unlik that investor will focu on the major headlin number come out of the Microsoft earn report. A beat or miss of a penni or two on earn like isn't go to drive the market' reaction to the report - particularli if that weak come from Windows. Rather, the focu is go to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notabl Azure.There' a reason Microsoft ha steadili expand it disclosur around Azur and cloud growth: That' where investor attent ha been. And it seem like that' where investor attent will stay come out of the Q2 Microsoft earn report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestor seem like to have some patienc with a modest miss in the Microsoft earn report, as expect remain rel low. The compani still is get out from under it deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoff thi year should provid a boost to margin over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expect growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sale are project to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seem to be import in the Q2 Microsoft earn report is whether the base of that growth is intact.Whil Azur is estim to gener just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, it growth rate certainli will be watch closely. After a 140% increas in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, ani slowdown seem like to hurt the stock. But anoth 100%-plu figur would give further evid that Azur is a worthi competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.Th cloud busi as a whole - includ Offic 365 and Dynamics, which is tri to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be anoth area of post-earn analysis.Here' Whi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75What doe that mean for Microsoft stock come out of the Microsoft earn report?Overall, it mean that the quarter seem like to be judg more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobil still aren't the major of MSFT revenu or earnings, they are the cornerston of the Microsoft strategi go forward. And for now, it' rel clear that the market is content to wait for those sale and profit - as long as it continu to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliv anoth earn report that show growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock like will rise - even if the headlin number aren't perfect. But if there' ani sort of stumbl in either cloud or mobile, that investor patienc could revers - quickly.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stock to Build Your Portfolio AroundMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Is Build an AI MonsterTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Q2 Earn Previewappear first onInvestorPlace."

It' been report that Google' Schmidt ha also found reason to visit the President. Execut that have support Trump from the start are better off: some specul that Zuckerberg is consid polit while ex-MicrosoftMSFTand GM employe Chri Liddel is move to the White Hous as assist to the Presid and director of strateg initiatives. Oracl CEO Safra Catz join the execut committe of Trump' presidenti transit team in December.Then there' Cramer, promis us that the post inaugur sell-off won't last and that it' actual an opportun to buy stocks.Amidst all the excit surround the swear in, the FTC su QualcommQCOMfor anti-competit practic while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchas of Oculus. So let' dig in.Appl Forc to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollow similar lawsuits, huge fine ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetit investig in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Feder Trade Commiss (FTC) ha su Qualcomm for ""de facto exclus deal that were as effect as express purchas requir and that effect foreclos Qualcomm' competitor from gain processor busi at Apple.""Th FTC alleg that Qualcomm allow Appl billion in discount for exclus use it chip and not use the compet 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel wa pushing. Thi agreement, run from 2011 to 2016, ultim kill WiMax. Appl wast no time in sourc from Intel after the expiri of the agreement in Sep 2016.Anoth point in content is Qualcomm' practic of limit access to it cellular chip and then hike royalti payments, amount to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processor manufactur by Qualcomm' competitors."" The FTC file the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm ha of cours deni the charg while Appl chose not to comment.Follow the FTC lawsuit, Appl file one of it own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Appl alleg that Qualcomm is withold for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal wa to keep Qualcomm chip in Appl product and is a fair indic that Qualcomm final ha some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deni charg that Facebook wa awar of the violat of ani employe agreement between Occulu head John Carmack and it former employ id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in thi case. He also deni that the technolog develop by the startup Occulu and it founder Palmer Luckey wa base on copyright technolog belong to ZeniMax.Carmack previous testifi that he copi file from ZeniMax befor move to Occulu but did not use the inform in Occulu and the term of hi employ allow him to get involv with Occulu even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at thi point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi' question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-someth billion deal wa to begin legal dilig on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""CompanyLast WeekLast 6 MonthsAAPL+2.09%+21.62%FB+0.33%+6.42%YHOO-0.14%+10.80%GOOGL-0.16%+9.94%MSFT+0.21%+16.26%INTC+0.63%+5.38%CSCO+0.20%+0.64%AMZN-0.65%+9.82%Oth stori you might have missed-CorporateIndia Consid Appl Case: It' hard to tell just how badli India want Appl to manufactur in the country. But if govern offici agre to Apple' demands, it would indic that they want it bad. Becaus Appl ha ask for just about everi concess possible, rang from reduct in import duti on smartphones, custom duti exempt on manufactur equip and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" custom procedur to be complet in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhon that are more than 3 year old so they can be exported, and so forth.Appl is tri to convinc govern offici that Indian made iPhon won't be competit unless they give in to these demand even as it manufactur cost in China are on the rise. But Asian phone maker are alreadi manufactur in the countri with no such concessions, so the regul themselv may need to be alter and relax to accommod not just Appl but also other manufacturers. Thi could take time.On a posit note, Reuter report that Inform Technolog Minist Ravi Shankar Prasad ha mention the set up of a govern panel head by the cabinet secretari that would now clear invest propos in the electron sector abov $1 billion, instead of them go through multipl govern departments.Microsoft Execut Join Baidu: Baidu ha appoint Qi Lu as it Chief Oper Offic and Group Head as it turn focu to artifici intellig as the next growth driver.

On check 25K search results, it found that Googl product occupi the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spot 43% of the time.Googl ha said that thi is becaus it is also a buyer of ads, so it posit come from pay a higher price. It also say that thi doesn't rais price becaus when other bid for the price, it' as if Googl isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertis lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it.

Not a game-changer, clearly.Source: TwitterButNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) just made the differ a littl more important, by ad support for Netflix download to SD card on Android.makeArticleAd();To SD or Not to SDFrom the start, AAPL spurn the idea of give iPhon (or iPad) user access to extern storage. The compani design iO to hide file directori from the user level - keep the user interfac extrem simpl - and that meant not be abl to choos whether to save a file in built-in storage, or in extern storage.Besid keep the user interfac clean and easier to support, the move also wa a financi windfal for Apple. Without ani option to boost storage, user who want more than the bare minimum would be forc to pay for the next tier in iPhones. So that $649 base model becam $749.AAPL' profit margin on that extra $100 wa considerable, sinc the flash memori use for storag is inexpensive.For point of comparison, go from 32GB to 128GB on the iPhon 7 is an extra $100, while a 128GB microSD card can be had for $50. And that' pay retail prices, which AAPL most certainli doe not.Google, on the other hand, support the use of SD card for extern storage.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI Monster,1/24/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhen investor think of artifici intellig stocks,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't usual the first name that come to mind. Mani consum viewAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) as the leader in at-hom AI, due to the success of the company' Echo device, while ""Watson"" fromIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is arguabl the top turn-key artifici intellig solut for enterprise-level entities.Thos investor who believ AI is the future, however, may want to put MSFT stock back on their radar as a way to play the movement.makeArticleAd();Th softwar giant' recent acquisit of Maluuba speak volum about it artifici intellig ambit and what it actual want to ""do"" with it.What' Maluuba?Maluuba isn't a household name, but within artifici intellig circl (and these are VP of AI Research Harri Shum' words), ""Maluuba' vision is to advanc toward a more gener artifici intellig by creat liter machin that can think, reason and commun like human - a vision exactli in line with ours.""In simpler terms, the AI agent doesn't just serv up a can respons to the most like question it think it' be ask base on keywords. Rather, Maluuba understand the word be used,their context, and what inform is desired. The util of such a tool could vari from find a specif qualif or experi from within a company' rank to a chatbot that actual work without talk in circles.Thos are just small exampl of how a next-gener artifici intellig - call artifici gener intelligence, in thi case - could be use and monetized. In September, when Microsoft assembl 5,000 engin to work on AI, Shum specif point out that such a technolog could not onli make Cortana and Skype more potent, butcould be incorpor into Microsoft' popular cloud-bas app such as Offic 365 and Azureto enhanc the ease-of-us factor for those platforms.7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stock That Are Dead Weight Right NowYou Ain't Seen Nothin' YetIt' difficult to see, or sense, but Microsoft is develop it AGI know-how with as much of a philosoph bent as it is a technic one.Just in time, too. AsCIO' Matt Kapko observ in December, ""While machin learn ha gener tremend interest throughout the enterprise, a wide gap still exist between research and benefici use case in the real world.""Th ramped-up focu on AI (and thi happen well befor Maluuba) couldn't have come at a better time for Microsoft, either, and by extension, for owner of MSFT stock.Cal a spade a spade, Microsoft larg miss out on the earli phase of artifici intelligence; now it' play catch up. It' play it well, though, particularli focus on ""bots"" - or chatbot that can intellig text-chat with a user - as the organ believ that' the interfac that make the most sens of such a platform. Thi kind of AI could potenti replac mani of the touch-bas app found on your smartphon withon voice-bas convers tool that actual doe everythingth way you want it done.Presid and princip analyst of Moor Insight & Strategy, Patrick Moorhead, ha taken notice, too, comment last month that ""Microsoft surpris everyon in 2016 and I'm expect more surpris in 2017."" Specifically, Moorhead believ Microsoft will unveil an artifici intellig that will not onli be more power to individu consum than Amazon' Echo, but will also serv a specif busi (read ""revenue-bearing"") function. Incorpor Maluuba' know-how will onli move the compani closer to that end zone.At stake is a piec of a market thatcould be worth $16.6 billion by 2022. Tractica think the artifici intellig market willb worth $36.8 billion by 2025. Both are a far cri from 2016' estim global AI revenu of $644 million.Now, all of a sudden, Microsoft' intens interest make sense.Bottom Line for MSFT StockNon of thi is to suggest that that MSFT stock should be view first and foremost as an artifici intellig stock, now or later. It' still a productivity-solut stock, and AI simpli help the organ provid better solutions.7 Stock to Buy to Doubl Your Money in 2017Nevertheless, Microsoft may well be work on one of the most market use of artifici intelligence, serv enterpris in a veri real way - beyond the home-util that the Echo provides, while not impos overkil with someth like IBM' Watson.

How Microsoft Has Changed in the Past 3 Years,1/24/2017,"Satya Nadella becam CEO ofMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) about three year ago, with hi formal appoint come on Feb. 4, 2014. It wa an inspir pick that also repres a chang in tone from previou boss Steve Ballmer. What wasn't known at the time is just how radic Nadella would divert from the strategi of hi predecessor and founder/CEO Bill Gate befor him.Nadella wasn't anoth member of the old guard take over. He wasn't a Gate discipl who'd been around sinc the earli day of the compani in the mid-1970s, but have start in 1992. He did have a strong base of knowledg about where the compani wa and where it need to go. When he took over, he made it veri clear that chang were come and they were go to come quickly.""Microsoft is one of those rare compani to have truli revolution the world through technology, and I couldn't be more honor to have been chosen to lead the company,"" Nadella said in apress releaseat the time. ""The opportun ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to seiz it, we must focu clearly, move faster, and continu to transform. A big part of my job is to acceler our abil to bring innov product to our custom more quickly.""makeArticleAd();Thos remark would prove prescient, as it' fair to say Nadella quickli chang how Microsoft doe business. It wa a radic remak that turn a still-success tech dinosaur into a compani built for the futur as well as the present.Microsoft ha chang dramat in three year under Nadella. Imag source: Microsoft.How ha Microsoft changed?Und Gate and Ballmer, Microsoft oper in a close ecosystem. The compani want peopl to buy Window computers, so it gener kept it product insid that system. There wereApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac version of Office, but even those weren't updat nearli as often as the Window version -- and they onli succeed becaus so few option existed.Tri to keep everyth in the Window world backfir on Microsoft when iO and Android phone and tablet exploded. Not have key product such as the variou Offic program in the two major app store start teach a gener of younger folk that there were alternatives.Nadella quickli chang that. In Novemb 2014, he brought the signatur product suit to Appl iO and Android devices. In addition, the compani offer up free version of program includ Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allow for view documents, as well as some limit editing.Thes moves, which the new CEO push through, also help Microsoft chang it busi model for these programs. Rather than push Offic as a one-tim sale, the compani move user toward subscriptions. That wa made much easier by Microsoft' newfound willing to allow consum to use Offic on whatev devic they wanted, instead of just Window machines.A differ companyIf Microsoft had kept the wall up, it probabl would have had a long futur as a steadili shrink busi sell to a core group of busi users. With it new strategy, the compani ha been abl to introduc Office, Skype, and even Window to a new gener while creat a steadi flow of subscript revenue. For example, revenu for Offic 365, the name for the subscript plan, wa up nearli 70% in Q2 2016.In addit to open up the company' product to Appl and Android products, Nadella ha also been a decis leader. He made the bold decis to scrap Window 8 and distanc the compani from it by move right to Window 10 -- a revamp that brought back mani well-lik features. He wa also quick to back away from the Window Phone, even if that meant admit that the compani larg wast $7.6 billion buyingNokia' devic division.Nadella ha also been a strong champion of innov at hi company. He support the struggl Surfac hybrid, which ha slowli becom a strength for Microsoft. In addition, the CEO ha back HoloLens, a future-look platform that could help bring virtual and augment realiti into the mainstream.Microsoft is hip nowCompar with Apple, Microsoft wa alway square. That' whi the old ""I'm a Mac/I'm a PC"" commerci worked. Now, under Nadella, Microsoft no longer feel the same. It still may not be quit as hip as Apple, but the Window maker ha gain some ground, and it media event now also contain surprises, like the SurfaceBook laptop.In three years, the new CEO ha taken hi compani from one in declin to one that ha a bright future. Some moves, such as Microsoft' grow cloud business, can also be credit to Ballmer, but open up the company' product to all platform ha chang the company' trajectori by exponenti open up it potenti audience.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Interesting January 2018 Stock Options for MSFT,1/23/2017,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Microsoft Corpor (Symbol: MSFT). So thi week we highlight one interest put contract, and one interest call contract, from the Januari 2018 expir for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $50 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of $1.85. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 3.7% return against the $50 commitment, or a 3.7% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to MSFT' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corpor see it share fall 20.3% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $48.15 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the $1.85 from $50), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 3.7% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annual 3.7% figur actual exce the 2.5% annual dividend paid by Microsoft Corpor by 1.2%, base on the current share price of $62.73. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to lose 20.33% to reach the $50 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, look at the dividend histori chart for MSFT below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 2.5% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the Januari 2018 expiration, for sharehold of Microsoft Corpor (Symbol: MSFT) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 2.5% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $72.50 strike and collect the premium base on the $1.60 bid, annual to an addit 2.6% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 5.1% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $72.50 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but MSFT share would have to advanc 15.5% from current level for that to occur, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 18.1% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Microsoft Corporation, highlight in green where the $50 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $72.50 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Januari 2018 put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

It softwar enabl compani to design, set up, and run their own onlin stores, and let them accept credit cards, view incom orders, and review complet transactions.Shopify' 18% ralli in Januari is a continu of it 150% ralli over the past 12 months. That ralli can be attribut to it impress top-lin growth -- it revenu surg 89% annually, to $99.6 million last quarter, follow four straight quarter of 90%+ growth.Shopifi serv over 325,000 merchant at the end of last quarter, which wa a big jump from it custom base of ""over 200,000"" merchant in the prior-year quarter, and it gross merchandis volum doubl to $3.8 million. It also announc deeper integr withAmazon' sale channel earlier thi month, make it easier for it custom to sell product on the e-commerc giant' marketplace.Analyst expect Shopify' revenu to rise 86% for the full year, but it still isn't profit yet on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. It GAAP loss widen last quarter, mainli due to higher stock-bas compens expenses, but it non-GAAP loss slightli narrowed. Shopifi is a pretti pricey stock at 13 time sales, but it growth trajectori might support that valuation.BoxBox provid onlin file share and person cloud content for businesses. The compani face tough challeng in the cloud-storag market from Dropbox and bigger tech giants, but it custom base alreadi includ massiv compani likeGener ElectricandSymantec.Lik Shopify, Box ha great top-lin growth and weak bottom-lin growth. It revenu rose 31% annually, to $102.8 million last quarter, as bill rose 26%. Defer revenue, a key indic of futur demand, jump 36%, to $192.6 million. Box' quarterli revenu have now risen by more than 30% annual for the past five quarters, and analyst anticip 31% sale growth thi year. Box is unprofit by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics, but it loss are narrow by both measures.Imag source: Getti Images.Box ha ralli 23% in January, but still trade at six time sales, which is onli slightli higher than the industri averag of four for application-softwar companies. But look ahead, Box and Dropbox both face veri tough competit in the cloud-storag market.Compani likeMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are offer plenti of free and cheap storag to enterpris custom to tether them to their cloud ecosystems. Despit that competition, Microsoft ha integr Box into Offic 365, spark rumor of an eventu takeover. With an enterpris valu of just over $2 billion, Box could certainli be a lucr target in a consolid of the cloud-storag market.WorkdayWorkday provid enterpris cloud applic that help compani staff, pay, and organ their workforces. They also util analyt and machin learn to help compani make financi and workforce-rel decisions.Demand for these servic ha been robust -- Workday' sale rose 34% annual last quarter and have risen 30% to 40% over the past four quarters. Analyst expect it revenu to rise 35% thi year, although the compani warn in earli Januari that a few of it bigger deal had been delay by global uncertainti regard Brexit, the U.S. presidenti election, and other G8 countri elections.But like Shopifi and Box, Workday ha weak profitability. That' becaus the cost of secur new custom coupl with price competit and the low margin of the cloud Saa (softwar as a service) market make it tough to squeez out a profit, even with double-digit sale growth. Workday squeez out a narrow non-GAAP profit last quarter, but it GAAP earn remain deep in the red. It price-to-sal ratio of 11 also look pricey rel to it software-industri peers.However, Workday stockrec ralliedafterWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) subscrib to it Human Capit Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Plan products. That dealmightadd $100 million to $200 million to Workday' annual revenu (5%-10% of it project revenu for next year), accord to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White -- but Wal-Mart didn't disclos how mani of it 2 million+ employe would actual use the system. Nonetheless, that ralli lift Workday stock 24% in January.Should you buy these stocks?Shopify, Box, and Workday are all fairli high-risk growth stocks. I believ that Box' lower valuat and buyout potenti make it the ""safest"" stock on thi list, while Shopify' incred top-lin growth make it the best growth play.

Why Himax Technologies Is Not a Top Stock to Buy Now,1/22/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Himax Technologies(NASDAQ: HIMX) may seem pois to benefit from the potenti growth of augment realiti (AR), but there' one major hurdl the compani will have to overcom befor that happens: AR devic are too expens for the mass market right now.makeArticleAd();Thi challeng can be overcom -- after all, we'r still at the begin stage of AR' growth. But as a compon maker, Himax reli on mass adopt to be abl to scale it AR compon production. With devic price so high, and adopt rate so low, Himax may not be a top stock to buy right now.AR is still too expens for consumersNorthland Capit Markets' Tom Sepenzi wrote in a recent investor note (republishedonBarron's):Aug realiti remain the largest potenti for HIMX with it LCO and WLO products, but the market ha hit anoth stumbl block as price remain prohibit for consumers. We believ that thi will limit the number of new AR devic for the next 12-24 months....He' refer to Himax' liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optic (WLO) product that the compani is ramp up thi year, with plan tobr new product onlin late thi yearor in earli 2018. Himax say that it work with 30 augment realiti devic maker right now, and believ that it' at ""the begin of a veri long-term growth story"" for AR.Th problem is that some AR devices, suchMicrosoft' HoloLen (which Himax is a supplier for), cost $3,000. To be fair, the current version of HoloLen is for developers. But at $3,000, AR devic are still a veri long way from becom a Saturday afternoon purchas for most consumers.A Bloomberg articl fromlast yearsaid it could take four to five year for AR and virtual realiti (VR) headset and other technolog to reach mainstream adoption, and that price will be one of the main factor in determin when they take off.A bit too earlyIt' hard to get pass the idea that Himax' AR potenti may still be a littl too far off. Sure, the compani is bring new product line onlin to prepar for possibl AR compon growth, but AR' viabil is not a sure thing.It can be a great thing for investor to find a compani that' bet on a new market that' pois for growth, but there appear to be too mani unknown for Himax. First, investor will be wait until the end of thi year, or the begin of 2018, to see the company' LCO and WLO product ramp up. If AR wa a sure-thing, then sit patient for that to come to fruition would be easier to stomach. As it stands, AR is still in it nascent stages.Second, compon maker like Himax can easili get burn in situat like this, where the need to score big design win from tech maker can take preced over earn solid margin and strong revenues. Himax CEO Jordan Wu indic on the Novemb earn call that it AR compon sale were fall becaus just one ""major customer"" wa pull back on demand:W therefor expect our LCO and WLO sale to declin in the fourth quarter, as well as over the next few quarter in 2017. We are not particularli worri about the short-term headwind as the said major custom is more commit than ever in the long-term develop of the AR product concept, which is view as a new comput platform and that Himax remain a critic partner to the custom in these AR efforts.Himax might be on the right path, but the company' relianc one just one key custom for AR sale -- and current AR devic price be too high -- make me perfectli comfort stay away from the stock right now.10 stock we like better than Himax TechnologiesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Has Toymaker Mattel Beaten Netgear With This New High-Tech Device?,1/21/2017,"When it come to high-tech gadgetry, you'd think network hardwar specialistNetgear(NASDAQ: NTGR) would have a command lead over toymakerMattel(NASDAQ: MAT) , but while both compani are branch out in new directions, where they'r intersect may actual have Barbie' parent in the lead.Even babi monitor have gone high-tech from their humbl walkie-talki beginnings. Imag source: Jori via Wikimedia Commons.makeArticleAd();Babi monitor have come a long way from the walkie-talkie-typ devic that let you listen in on the coo and cri of your infant. Today they'r part of the Internet of Thing in a connect home that let you wirelessli watch your child on your computer, laptop, or smartphon whether you'r at home, outside, or away. Yet for all their tech wizardry, they'r realli littl more than remot viewers, which is whi the surpris new develop from Mattel and Netgear are so innovative. They lift the babi monitor out of be just a static devic that watch and listen and turn it into someth that is interactive.Secur outsid the home, and in the nurseryNetgear' Arlo Babi is a natur progress from it Arlo and Arlo Q home secur camera that it acquir back in 2012, which were market at the time under the VueZon brand. After significantli upgrad the hardwar and network capabilities, they were rebrand as Arlo and won industri plaudits. So it' realli not such a stretch for Netgear to go from help you watch your hous and possess to keep an eye on your baby.Imag source: Arlo.Shap like a rabbit -- a small, Cyclops-lik rabbit -- the Arlo Babi offer parent two-way talk and listen capabilities, night vision, and 1080p video. That' not much more than what you'll find on exist babi monitor on the market like the Summer Infant Babi Link camera or TrendNet' WiFi Babi Cam, and even it preload lullabi and abil to play your own music can be found on devic like the iBabi Monitor M6S. It sensor monitor temperature, humidity, and air qualiti level in the nurseri as well as provid alert when the babi moves, similar to featur found on thePhilipsIn.Sight monitor.Wher Netgear' devic improv on exist monitor is combin them all into one product and then ad a few upgrad such as the abil to distinguish between a baby' cri and other sound an infant might make, and note it in it audio alerts. It also record movement and sound and store the clip in the cloud, allow you to download them for free for seven days, and allow for expans with five addit camera be ad for free, and up to 15 camera total.Technolog doesn't come cheap, though, as an Arlo Babi will set you back around $250, or $300 if you add a dedic 7-inch LCD viewer to it. Other accessories, includ cat and Dalmatian designs, are also available.Thi is definit not a toyMor remarkable, however, may be what Mattel ha achiev with it Aristotl by Nabi babi monitor. Essenti perform all of the same task as Netgear' Arlo, the toymaker' devic is no toy.Mattel enter the market in a roundabout way, acquir last year for $21.5 million the bankrupt compani Fuhu, which made the popular Nabi children' tablet. It unveil the Aristotl at thi year' Consum Electron Show, and though it will cost $299 when it becom avail thi summer, it offer what appear to be superior function over the Arlo and other devic on the market.Imag source: Microsoft.Beyond the capabl found elsewhere, the system is bill as the first artifici intellig smart assist for kids. Essenti anAmazonEcho or Googl Home, the Aristotl devic usesMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) program andQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) processor to recogn your child' voic patterns, and as the child grows, it becom more interactive. It can read stories, help a child learn the alphabet, and use Microsoft' Bing search engine, it can help a child search for answer to homework assignments.Furthermore, Mattel ha partner with retail likeTargetand Babi 'R' Us to take advantag of it abil to take note of nap and diaper chang times, and to speed up order of babi suppli that may be run low, like diaper or formula. It see the devic also becom connect with other toy for a greater immers play experi as well as partner with other compani for addit capabilities.Consid the opportun for thi ""babi monitor"" to develop into someth much more than simpli a static devic to watch, listen, and monitor, as well as to last beyond a child' infancy, it would seem Mattel ha jump well ahead of Netgear and other compani tri to compet for a share of the playroom.10 stock we like better than MattelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nokia's New Phone Sells Out in a Minute -- But What Does That Mean?,1/20/2017,"Nokia's(NYSE: NOK) new Android phone, the Nokia 6, reportedli sold out within the first minut on it launch day in China. The devic wa offer briefli in an onlin flash sale, although Nokia didn't disclos how mani unit were actual offered. However, over a million peopl reportedli regist for the flash sale.Th Nokia 6. Imag source: Nokia.makeArticleAd();Th Nokia 6 is a mid-rang devic which sport a Snapdragon 430 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a 16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front camera, a 3,000 mAh battery, and a 5.5"" screen. The device, which is onli avail in China for now, cost around $245 and run Android 7.0 out of the box.Thos spec don't sound too impressive, but the devic mark Nokia' long-await return to the smartphon market. But befor investor start think that thi is the start of Nokia' comeback, they should understand that Nokia' smartphon busi chang consider after it sold it handset unit toMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) back in 2014.The evolut of Nokia' smartphon businessAft Nokia sold it handset unit to Microsoft, it sign a non-compet agreement with Microsoft which bar it from sell new mobil devic until the end of 2016. Dure the follow two years, Microsoft drop the Nokia brand from it Lumia devices, and tri use them to grow Window Phone' market share against iO and Android. That effort flopped, and Window Phone now control less than 1% of the smartphon market. Admit defeat, Microsoft took a $7.6 billion writedown on the unit, laid off most of the handset unit, and reduc the number of annual Lumia launches.Dur that time, Nokia form a new busi unit call Nokia Technologies, which hous it patent portfolio and develop experiment new product like the Ozo VR camera. Nokia then realiz that it could licens out it design, patents, and brand to other compani that want to creat Nokia-brand devices. Thi strategi enabl Nokia to keep it brand relev and collect low-risk royalti without shoulder ani product costs.Nokia' N1 tablet. Imag source: Nokia.Sinc Nokia wa prohibit from launch new phones, it licens out it brand toFoxconnto creat the N1 Android tablet for China in earli 2015. Nokia and Foxconn use a flash sale strategi for the N1, proclaim that the devic sold out ""within minutes"" each time -- although the first batch onli includ 20,000 units. Nokia then realiz that it could appli the same strategi to the smartphon market onc the non-compet agreement expired.Th birth of HMD GlobalFor that purpose, privat equiti fund Smart Connect form a new company, led by former Nokia executives, calledHMDGloballast year. HMD obtain the exclus global licens (exclud Japan) to creat Nokia-brand phone and tablet over the next decade, and sign a contract to exclus sourc the product of the devic to Foxconn' subsidiari FIH Mobile. HMD and FIH Mobil also co-purchas Nokia' featur phone busi from Microsoft last May.Th creation of HMD Global meant that HMD and Foxconn would produc brand new Nokia devic while pay Nokia Technolog a steadi stream of royalties. Thi mean that robust sale of new Nokia handset would benefit HMD much more than Nokia, but Nokia would be insul from ani downsid risks.But can Nokia smartphon becom relev again?Nokia devic face a long uphil battl to becom relev again in the highli satur smartphon market. The Android market in China is a particularli brutal one flood with low-margin players. EvenXiaomi, the former Chines market leader which lost it crown toHuaweiin late 2015, admit that it didn't make ani money from it smartphon sale last November.Nokia' design and spec don't realli stand out in the Chines market, so HMD is like count on Nokia' brand strength and the hype of flash sale to boost demand. While the initi report of the Nokia 6 ""sell out"" are encouraging, the lack of actual sale figur indic that it' just an attempt to gener hype like the claim of it N1 tablet ""sell out"" dure it flash sales. Therefore, investor should keep an eye on the Nokia 6' recept in China, but they shouldn't believ that it signal a comeback for Nokia in the smartphon market.10 stock we like better than NokiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Square Inc (SQ) Stock Needs to Make Some Money,1/20/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSquar Inc.(NYSE:SQ) ha never been a money-mak proposition. Like mani tech companies, net incom ha not been their thing, man.Growthha been their thing. Revenu rose from $552 million in 2013 to $1.267 billion two year later, and that record will like be beaten when the compani next report on Jan. 31.makeArticleAd();Source:Chri Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Analyst are expecting$451 million in revenu for the quarter, or $1.307 billion for the year. The whisper on losses, 8 cent per share, would bring total loss for the year to 46 cents. Squar surviv on hope and cash flow, which wa slightli posit in 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. It growth is slow noticeably.But what if, just for fun, Squar did someth wild, crazy, and in-lin with what the rest of the payment industri does, and made a littl money for shareholders?Th stock would take off. It would take off bigly.How Squar Stock Might Make MoneySquar is not go to make a net profit as a processor. It' not go to bypass exchang fees. Instead it' go to becom profit as a platform, with a host of financi product attract to it small busi base.Th 7 Best High-Yield Invest for RetirementA our Jame Brumley wrote thi weekthes includ Squar Capital, whose loan havedoubl over the last year. Squar is also offeringpayrol services, inventori manag and analyticsto it small busi customers.Thi hope ha sent SQ stock up 56% in the last six months, which sound great until you take the chart out a few months, and see that stock hit anoth peak in April, 2015, which took it higher than the present price of $14.90. At that point, specul on brighter day had push it to $15.13.Who Want SQ Stock?Partli for that reason, our Tom Taulli ha anoth reason to buy Squar stock.A takeout bait.Squar ha a power brand (at least within it niche), it' big in mobile, and there are a lot of big tech compani that aren't in payment yet but might like a play there, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).That' interesting, but if SQ stock were go to be taken out, the buyer would not like come from that quarter. Process is someth a tech compani can do for itself, if it' interest in that low-margin business. There are easier way to make money.It' more like the buyer would come from the payment mainstream - processor likeFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC),PayP Hold Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) andVantiv Inc(NASDAQ:VNTV). These compani understand just how complex process merchant payment are, and what the capac is worth. Wait a few year and mayb some bank organ likeJP Morgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) orCapit One Financi Corp.(NYSE:COF) might come calling.A move by ani of these player could set off a feed frenzi in the industry, one that would deliv sharehold a premium well over it current $5.3 billion price.That may be whi a processor isn't make such a move. SQ stock is alreadi bigger, by market cap, thanNCR Corporation(NYSE:NCR), which ha been around sinc the 19th century.Th ancillari busi may also be unattractive. It' hard enough just process payments.A win premium would also make Squar unafford for a merchant processor outfit like Vantiv, worth $12.3 billion, and make the merchant payment outfit vulner to takeov by one of the bank that distribut card and serv the custom side of the transaction. MaybeIntuit Inc.(NASDAQ:INTU) orAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) might be interest in upset the appl cart in that way, but again you'r talk about a less-profit oper and, in the case of Intuit (worth $30.1 billion), a deal that could soak up a lot of it market cap.A SpeculationTher are mani compani that could make a move on SQ stock, set off a frenzi of merger activ in the payment space akin to what everyon keep expect will happen in media after Sumner Redston die and the shark come forViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIAB).I the Groupon Inc (GRPN) Comeback Done for Good?But wait for such a frenzy, bet on it with your money, is speculation. Squar today is still a money-los proposit in an industri where lose money is uncommon, and a compani whose growth is slow rapidly.Go for it if you wish, but don't hock the silver. Thi is a mad money play.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, avail at the Amazon Kindl store.

"Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years",1/20/2017,"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump ha been sworn in as the 45th presid of the Unit States. The President-elect, who pledg to “Make America great again,” promis plenti of thing he would do regard hi first day in office. From repeal and replac Obamacar to renegoti NAFTA and begin the construct of the wall on the Mexican border.W won’t know for certain which of Trump’ polici will take prioriti or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on hi promis to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he need busi to lead, innov and hire workers. For that to happen, busi leader need to know their govern is on their side. To that end, here are some name to own for the next four year (at least) as Trump’ polici take shape.makeArticleAd();Low Corpor TaxesTrump’ promis to lower corpor tax can have a boost effect on the tech sector, which ha an estim $1.4 trillion stash in oversea tax havens. These includ some America' largest corpor such as Appl (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not onli ha Trump promis to lower the busi tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledg to elimin the corpor altern minimum tax.Beyond lower the tax rate, it would hardli shock anyon if Trump — given hi pro-busi stanc — were to enact a tax holiday at some point dure hi presidency. Compani like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capit Tesla (TSLA) can acceler the build of it Gigafactory, help it achiev not onli higher profit margins, but also higher vehicl production. In the process, Tesla would ignit the state of Nevada as an innov hub, while mass-produc produc emission-fre vehicl at afford prices.“Rep and Replace”Th Afford Care Act, a.k.a Obamacar wa design to — among other thing — “insur the un-insurable.” Notably, to provid insur coverag to peopl with pre-exist condit who were block under the then-exist rules. Depend on what side of the aisl you’r on, Obamacar either did it job or wa a “complet disaster,” accord to Trump. Still, whether Obamacar is entir dismantl or part of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth ha work aggress to exit the Afford Care exchanges, which reduc it exposur to ani chang Trump might make. What’ more, ad from be the nation' largest health insurer, UnitedHealth own Optum, which provid pharmaci benefit manag services. Last week, not onli did the compani beat top- and bottom-lin estimates, UnitedHealth rais it fiscal 2017 financi outlook, suggest it is readi for whatev Trump decid to do.Not everi compani will be as lucky. Conversely, compani such HCA Hold (HCA) and Univers Health Servic (UHS) that prosper under Obamacar may suffer. As will govern health care provid such as Centen Corpor (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc.

After all, how can he achiev econom growth and strengthen small busi if bank aren't lend money — someth bank collect struggl to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenc by the strong earn result releas so far from the like of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sach (GS), financi are onc again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consum protect and creat tougher rule on excess risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ha been cite by bank execut as a prohibit of growth. ""There' mani aspect of it that we'v got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump' pick for Treasuri secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, call Dodd-Frank ""the number one prioriti on the regulatori side.”To that end, I would be surpris if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in hi first 100 day in office.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can’t Please Everybody,1/20/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI have to admit straight off the bat that I'm not too fond of write aboutAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For starters, everyon - and I do meaneveryone- ha an opinion on Appl stock.Source: AppleEven those that may be uninterest in the markets, or consum who prefer product fromSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) orSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE), still seem to throw in their two cents. That' the power of the Appl brand.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');I'm not complaining. Although I have a financi interest in SNE stock, and have own Samsung smartphon in the past, Appl product are better. It ecosystem is seamlessli connected, and it interfac is intuitive. Best of all, the compani ha an uncanni abil to provid solut for which you have yet to realiz is a problem. And no - find a good-looking, untuck dress shirt isnot a real problem!Th central issu I have with Appl stock is that investor may be too emot vested. If there' ani advic I can give, it' that busi is all about the numbers. Hold ani other view could lead you down a danger path.Posit Factor Buoy Appl StockAdmittedly, Appl stock doesn't make market agnostic easy. The heart of the organ of cours is the iPhone. Last Friday, rumor circul that the upcom iPhon 8 will featurebett water resistancethan it predecessor. The improv could potenti allow the ""8"" to surviv immers greater than one meter deep. Whether the safeti featur is actual use or not, it' agreat market tool. Samsung initi their waterproof model with their Galaxi GS4 Activ to critic acclaim.7 Stock to Sell Befor They ImplodeOf course, there' much more to Apple' flagship product than make it accid proof. Accord toInvestorPlac writer Tom Taulli, there are alreadi ""indic that the devic will be standout, such as with OLE (organ light emit diodes) screens, which will be thinner and perhap even allow for bending. Interestingli enough, there may not even be a bezel, which will not onli make the devic look sleeker - one of Apple' hallmark - but allow more room on the screen.""W also must consid the Appl stock price in compar valu against the broader consum technolog industry. As Taulli notes, ""AAPL stock still sport a reason valuation, with the forward price-to-earn ratio of 11.5X. Hey,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is at 19X andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is trade at 14X.""To go along with thi analysis, you have to appreci the creativ synergi that drive Appl stock. Despit roadblock like theSuprem Court decisionthat ha seriou implic for intellectu properti rights, AAPL, and by extension, AAPL stock keep on chugging. I don't doubt for a second that they'll continu assert themselv in the retail market. They'r too much of avalu entityfor ani other cours of action.Weak in Apple' ArmorYet it' in the financi market where Appl stock lose some sheen. AsInvestor' Busi Dailywryli notes, in the same year that AAPL ""open an edific to it great - a massiv new headquart that look like a fli saucer - the compani face grow question about it futur and whether it can still surpris and delight custom with excit new gadgets."" Furthermore, expect are ""sky-high that 2017' 10th anniversari iPhon will be someth special that unleash the full potenti of the Appl revenue-gener ecosystem.""No one question that AAPL stock is back by a solid team carri out founder Steve Jobs' grand vision. Nevertheless, that' a lot of pressur ride on the company. It' a well-known fact that a major of AAPL' sale and profit come from the iPhone. In fact, we are start to see some kink in the vaunt armor.Again,Investor' Busi Dailywrit that iPhon ""sale declin last year for the first time ever, dure the iPhon 6S cycle. They could fall again thi year, dure the iPhon 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhon unit sale declin 8%, while iPhon revenu shrank 12%.""Furthermore, there' an overreli on it smartphon divis that could come back to haunt them. A glare exampl is the fact that Appl hasn't done much of anyth with it premium line of Mac computers. Sure, that industri is in decline, but Appl ha alway been chic-cool. If it' abandon Mac in favor of portabl e-devices, it' go to be in a dogfight with discount-pric leaders.And if it can't protect it design as the Suprem Court decis implies, that just make Apple' job all the more difficult. Hence, it either need to kill it with it new iPhon or it need other product for diversification.Techn Challeng AheadClick to EnlargeThi is where we get into a real tough decision. My heart tell me that AAPL is go to be just fine - and there' good reason to believ that.But Appl stock realli hasn't shown that much confidence. Yeah, it' soar from last summer, but that' what ralli from yearli low are suppos to do. What happen next is the critic question.In 2015, Appl stock took multipl bite at $130, onli to be rebuffed. It then faltered, and onli began to pick itself up just recently. Now, it' head toward anoth crack at the psycholog price target. Is the fifth time the charm? I'm sure AAPL stock is good for anoth 8% or 9% - enough to get real close to $130.Abandon Gener Electr Compani (GE) Stock After Q4 EarningsBut to actual breach that level and build someth substant on top of it? That' where I have my doubt about Appl stock. What AAPL does, no one doe better. But after so mani year follow the releas of the first smart devices, the consum is expect much more. Appl will deliver, but what it doe may not be so excit for Wall Street.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto wa long SNE stock.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Most Danger Dividend Stock for 20173 Vanguard Fund That Are Take on WaterTh postAppl Inc.
