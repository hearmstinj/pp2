Share of both compani are up around 30% in 2017, thank to the iPhon 7 product cycl and the grow popular of Huawei' smartphones.Th two semiconductor specialist are known for make connect chip use in smartphon and Internet of Thing applications, but one of them is cede ground to the other due to stiff competition. Here' what investor can expect from Skywork and Qorvo go forward.makeArticleAd();SWKSdata byYCharts.Th case for SkyworksSkywork Solut ha been busi diversifi it revenu streams, as it reli on the iPhon maker for an estimated40% of it business. As it turn out, Huawei is now it second-largest client, while it also suppli chip to other Chines smartphon compani such as Oppo and Vivo.Skyworks' aggress pursuit of fast-grow Chines smartphon player ha reap dividend as itssecond-quart guidanceturn out to be better than expectations. More importantly, the compani ha been churn out China-centr product -- such as a front-end LTE solut -- to tap the country' fast-grow LTE smartphon market.Skyworks' focu on China will be a long-term catalyst thank to rapid LTE adopt in thi market. For instance, the region' LTE subscript shot up 84% last year, outpac global growth of 64%. Accord to GSMA Intelligence, China' LTE subscript will continu grow at a fast pace, reach 1 billion user thi year from 762 million in 2015.GSMA Intellig forecast that 70% of LTE user in China will be on the TD-LTE network, which Skywork is look to tap with it recent launch SkyOn Ultra 2.5 product family. Therefore, the chipmak is pull the right string to grab a slice of thi market, as smartphon shipment from the top 10 Chines smartphon maker could jump 39% thi year.Imag source: Skywork SolutionsApple' next iPhone, meanwhile, could provid anoth catalyst for Skyworks. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh and Jason Getz recent upgrad the stock base on it abil to benefit from a strong iPhon product cycle. The Mizuho analyst forecast that Appl will manufactur 120 million unit of the upcom iPhone, compar to 89 million unit of the iPhon 7 and 7 Plus.Skywork is also gain traction in automotive: It ha won spot atVolkswagen,Samsung, and a ""lead U.S. electr car OEM.""

Samsung, on the other hand, is use it chip for remot diagnost applications.In all, Skywork is spread it wing in all the right place to ensur long-term growth.Qorvo appear to be on shaki groundQorvo share might have shot up impress thi year, but the momentum may not last long. The company'sfourth-quart guidanceof $630 million in revenu wa way below the Wall Street forecast of $719 million, thank to delay in smartphon product ramp-up by it key customers.In hi prepar remarks, Qorvo CFO Mark Murphi said that the outlook suffer as ""two of our lead custom in China and a tier 1 custom in Korea delay flagship smartphon launches,"" point at the Samsung Galaxi S8' late launch. The Chines client probabl refer to Huawei, which contribut 11% to Qorvo' top line.However, Qorvo' weak outlook as compar to a strong one from Skywork suggest that the latter could be win market share, sinc both compani have some of the same clients. Skyworks, for instance, suppli all of the radio-frequ chip in Huawei' flagship smartphon last year, and suppli three chip to Appl versu Qorvo' two.ABarron'sreport suggest that Skywork is win content at Samsung, while it RF design win at Huawei could encourag other Chines smartphon maker to follow suit. The company' manag corrobor thi possibility: CEO Liam Griffin said Skywork ha been gain content in multipl Samsung devices, apart from key win at Chines smartphon companies. Qorvo, therefore, could be lose busi to Skyworks.Th better betConsensu estim suggest that Skyworks' revenu will grow 8.6% thi fiscal year and 10.1% in the next one. Qorvo' revenu growth, on the other hand, will declin sharpli to just 7.6% in the next fiscal year from 15.7% in the ongo one.

"Apple, Inc. Stock Surges Past $140 -- What's Next?",3/20/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock ha seemingli been hit new high everi week recently. And now the tech giant' stock ha pass $140 and is trade just over $141 thi week. With the stock rise 21% in the past three months, it' a good time to take a look at Apple' overal busi and ponder what' next for the tech giant.Stil an iPhone-driven businessBeliev it or not, just over nine year after Appl introduc the first iPhone, the smartphon is still Apple' bread and butter. In Apple' most recent quarter, for instance, the iPhon account for a whop 69% of the company' revenue. Of course, thi mean Apple' other product segment pale in comparison. Mac, Services, iPad, and other product segment repres about 9%, 9%, 7%, and 5% of the total revenue, respectively.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();When iPhon sale were soaring, it signific share of revenu wa a good thing. But now iPhone' share of revenu is creat a problem for Apple. iPhon unit sale dure the trail 12 month are down 7% compar to the year-ago period, highlight how difficult it is for Appl to grow sale of it flagship product. Sure, iPhon unit and revenu are up about 5% year over year in the company' most recent quarter, provid a glimps of a possibl rebound in iPhon sale -- particularli if Apple' upcom 10th-anniversari iPhon is as big of an improvementa rumor suggest it will be. But, given the growth headwind iPhon ha face recently, investor shouldn't count on a sharp rebound in iPhon sales.With iPhon sale slow andAppl stocktrad at a new all-tim high abov $140, thi may have some investor wondering: Where can the growth come from next?What' Apple' next big catalyst?Fortunately, even if iPhon sale struggl to grow from here, two area of Apple' busi are offer promis prospects: servic and other products.Servic is probabl Apple' most import catalyst. Indeed, while Mac revenu in Apple' most recent quarter wa greater than servic revenu -- thank to the company' recent introduct of it new MacBook Pro laptop -- on a trailing-12-month basis, servic revenu is now greater than Mac revenue. Dure thi period, servic account for a strong 12% of total revenu -- slightli higher than Mac' 11% share of total Appl revenue.Imag source: Apple.Apple' servic revenu in the company' most recent quarter hit an all-tim high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year. And there'sgood reasonto expect Apple' servic revenu will continu growing. For instance, Apple' App Store revenue, which is part of the company' servic segment, wa up 43% year over year in Apple' holiday quarter. Further, manag ha forecast annual servic revenu will doubl over the next four years, grow to just over $50 billion in 2020.Apple' other product segment, is more of a wildcard than services. Account for just 5% of trailing-12-month revenue, the segment is still veri small as a proport of total revenue. However, the 2014 introduct of Appl Watch ha proven the compani can carri over it brand power to new product segments. Sure, the product hasn't transform into a major revenu driver for the company. But it' still fare well sever year after it launch, with Appl report Appl Watch revenu wa at an all-tim high in the company' most recent quarter.Combin Appl stock'sconserv valuationwith a promis outlook for it servic and other product segments, I'm still bet on Appl stock -- even abov $140.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Management Really to Blame for Intel Corporation's Woes?,3/20/2017,"Brian Krzanich becameIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) sixth CEO on May 16, 2013. Sinc then, Intel stock ha ralli 46% -- which seem solid, but mere match the S&P 500' 46% gain and underperform the NASDAQ' 72% gain. That perform isn't bad, but mani investor have wonder if Intel would fare better under a new leader.Last May, fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa argu that it wastim to replaceKrzanich, due to Intel' disastr mobil strategy, it delay transit from 14nm to 10nm chips, and the stock' lacklust performance. But is Krzanich the real reason that Intel fail to outperform the market? Let' take a closer look at the biggest problem with Krzanich' leadership, and whether or not those flaw are drag down Intel' growth.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Intel drop the mobil ball befor Krzanich took overTo be fair, Krzanich wa dealt a terribl hand in the mobil market when he becam Intel' CEO. In 2006, hi predecessor Paul Otellini sold Intel' ARM-bas Xscale busi toMarvel Technology, then rejectedApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) offer to suppli applic processor for the first iPhone. At the time, Otellini didn't believ that mobil chip would disrupt the PC market.In 2008, Intel launch it low-pow Atom x86 chip for netbook and mobil devices, but the first gener chip were less power effici than ARM designs. The Atom chip gradual improv over time, but that initi misstep enabl ARM chipmak likeQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) to take over the mobil market. ARM claim that 95% of all smartphon in the world now use it chip designs.But Krzanich' solut were also ineffectiveTh good news is that Krzanich realiz that Intel had to counter ARM in the mobil market. The bad news is that hi solut were expens and ineffective.Krzanich tri to win back mobil OEM by give them steep discount on Atom chips, co-market agreements, and financi aid in redesign logic board for x86 chips. The compani call those subsidi ""contra revenues"", which burn through roughli $10 billion to captur less than 1% of the mobil market.Intel' Atom-pow smartphones. Imag source: Intel.Krzanich then hire sever major execut fromQualcomm and ARM, which wa a bold move for the insular company. But those hires, particularli that of former Qualcomm co-presid Venkata ""Murthy"" Renduchintala, reportedli stir up intern conflicts. Krzanich final admit defeat and Intel stop invest in it Atom chipset for smartphon and tablet last year,opt to pivottoward modem for the latest iPhon and next-gen 5G chipset instead.Pul some iPhon modem order from Qualcomm should have been a victori for Intel, but Appl admit that itthrottl the speedof Qualcomm modem in the iPhon 7 to match the slower speed of the Intel modems. That report cast seriou doubt on Intel' abil to effect grow it baseband modem business.Krzanich believ that expand Intel' presenc in the Internet of Thing (IoT) market with low-pow modul like the button-s Curi will offset it weak in mobil devices. However, the IoT busi account for just 4% of it revenu in 2016, and the busi face stiff competit from low-pow ARM modules.Intel could lose it domin of PC and data centersLook ahead, Intel' domin market share in PC and data center could be threaten by new product and partnerships.AMD(NASDAQ: AMD) , for example, recent introduc it new Ryzen x86 chips, which appear to trump Intel' current-gen Kabi Lake chip in term of price-to-performance.Imag source: Intel.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent launch new version of Window 10 which are compat with both Intel' x86 chip and Qualcomm' Snapdragon chips. Microsoft also announc that it will run it Azur cloud platform on Qualcomm' new ARM-bas Centriq 2400 server solutions. These new deal could eventu throttl the growth of Intel' core Client Comput and Data Center businesses.Krzanich' pricey turnaround strategiesLastly, Krzanich' turnaround strategi are expensive. Besid the $10 billion in contra revenu it burn through in three years, Intel spent nearli $17 billion on programm chipmak Altera in late 2015, and recent announc that it would acquir automot collis avoid system makerMobileyefor over $15 billion. These move are caus Intel' long-term debt to surg rel to it free cash flow.Source:YChartsThos acquisit won't endang Intel' dividends, which use up just 35% of it FCF over the past 12 months, but they indic that Krzanich could ""diworsify"" the company' busi with desper pricey acquisitions.Th verdictIt' tempt to think that Intel might fare better under a new leader, but Krzanich inherit a troubl compani and I believ he' tri to rejuven the compani with outsid hires, expans into new market like non-volatil memori and IoT chips, and strateg acquisitions.Thes effort won't pay off anytim soon, sinc analyst expect Intel' revenu and earn to respect rise just 1% and 3% thi year, but they could eventu reduc the company' depend on it age PC and data center businesses.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock is fetch less than 16 time thi fiscal year' earn estim and less than 14 time next year' forecast. Rise earn and multipl expans can be a one-two punch to big stock gain despit Appl hit new high alreadi on Monday.Arcuri isn't alone. RBC Capit analyst Amit Daryanani is reiter hi bullish rate on the stock and stick to the same $155 price target where Arcuri is now perched. Daryanani is also encourag by some of the expect featur for the iPhon 8 that includ wireless charg and a complet redesign that may includ a curv OLE screen on a high-end model. He feel that it will match or beat the iPhon 6.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson is also park at $155, but he may be even more bullish. He' talk up Apple' servic revenue, a segment that' still a smart part of the revenu mix but grow quickly. There are chunkier margin to be had on the servic end, and as that segment continu to grow, Olson argu that Appl could be worth as much as $195 in two years. So, yes, $155 may be the next stop -- but it won't be the final destination.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Interesting January 2019 Stock Options for AAPL,3/20/2017,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Appl Inc (Symbol: AAPL).

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $85 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of $2.10.

So unless Appl Inc see it share fall 39.8% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $82.90 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the $2.10 from $85), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 1.4% annual rate of return.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the Januari 2019 expiration, for sharehold of Appl Inc (Symbol: AAPL) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 1.6% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $170 strike and collect the premium base on the $7.60 bid, annual to an addit 2.9% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 4.6% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $170 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but AAPL share would have to advanc 20.3% from current level for that to happen, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 25.7% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.makeArticleAd();Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Appl Inc, highlight in green where the $85 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $170 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Januari 2019 put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

And not just about it upcom fiscal third-quart results. The major of observ are expect a pretti healthi 2017 as well.Ar the mass right to remain bullish on Nike stock, which is up 15% year-to-date? Tomorrow' quarterli earn report will go a long way in answer that question.Nik Earn PreviewA of the most recent calculation, Nike is expect to report a profit of 53 cent per share on revenu of $8.47 billion. That top-lin project is 5.4% better than the year-ago figure, though the expect bottom line is a tad weaker than the 55 cent per share of NKE stock earn in the same quarter of the previou year.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashAlthough uneven from time to time, Nike is now past the halfway point of a sixth consecut year of earn growth. It would be surpris if the trajectori wa alter now. Indeed, not onli ha Nike not miss an earn estim in years, it' top estim in each of the last eighteen quarters, suggest anoth beat is in the card for Tuesday.If there wa ever a chanc for Nike to fall victim to a March Mad upset, tomorrow' earn report could be it.Sever retail likeSport Authority,Golfsmithand mani other smaller venu that sell Nike' good are shut their doors, with some of them owe Nike money. While most of that is old news, it can take month for inventori issu to fulli materialize.Still, that potenti downsid seem to alreadi be bake into earn expectations.Nik is expect to post it fiscal third quarter result shortli after Tuesday' close, with a confer call to follow at 5:00 pm EST. Both will be informative, but owner of NKE stock may want to pay particular attent to three matter that could push the stock around more than ani other. In no certain order:Adida Is Grow Market ShareFor year it wa a larg irrelev brand compar to Nike and Under Armour, especi in the all-import U.S. market. But, Adida is make some nois - and troubl - for Nike again.Pip Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy' recent explained:""W are reiter our Neutral rate & $51 PT on Nike share ahead of their FQ3 earn report on 3/21. Our proprietari market model indic adidas? global share gain are accelerating, particularli in North America as the compani set it sight on grow it core brand to $5B by 2020. We see risk that Nike consensu sale & gross margin estim are walk down over the NTM.

In fact, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole still think it' an import enough figur toguess the number will onli fall 2% YOYwhen Nike report it third-quart number on Tuesday. That would be an improv on the 4% declin seen in the prior quarter.Wheth quantifi or not, the new Air VaporMax shoe line is go to be critic to Nike' near-term sales.

What is a huge opportun is the plus-siz apparel market that ha been larg dismiss by the industry. Nikerec launch a lineup of 1x, 2x and 3x fit cloth for women, which NPD Group estimatescould be a market worth $20 billion.Bottom Line for NKE StockTh bulk of the recent analyst rhetor about NKE stock ha focus on shrink gross margins, and well it should. That quantit metric, however, is ultim a function of the more qualit aspect of thi busi … the subject idea like address the right market with the right product at the right time.

That ultim will be determin year from now, but what I found interest wa the fact that an Intel execut came out and highlight the amount of data the compani will be abl to gather as a direct result of the acquisition.Think about it: Mobiley is a key player in the autonom automobil industry, make the chip that are use in driverless and semi-autonom vehicles.

My No. 1 Rule for Safe 8% Yields and 15% Upside in CEFs,3/20/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsThink of avoid closed-end funds, now that we'v got anoth Fed rate hike in the books?makeArticleAd();It' easi to see why, with the ""smart money"" - trader bet through the Fed fund futur market - expect anoth hike just three month from now. In all, the market' call for three hike thi year, and so is Janet Yellen.On Rate Hike Down, Two to Go?But if you let that scare you away from high-yield sector like CEFs, real estat invest trust and prefer shares, you'll miss out on some seriou income.In a moment, I'll show you how to pick theCEF with the most upside, along with the high payout these fund are known for.First, here' whi I'm pound the tabl on them now.Bust a Big CEF MythWhen mani folk think of CEFs, the first word that come to mind is leverage, and the risk that funds' borrow cost will spike along with rates.And it' certainli true that borrow cash play a big part in CEFs' outsiz dividend payouts.Tak theCalamo Strateg Total Return Fund(NASDQ:CSQ), one of the oldest equity-bas CEF (CSQ hold 63% of it portfolio in common stocks, with the rest in corpor bonds, convert bond and prefer shares).Thank to leverage, the fund' manag team can borrow cheaply, at around the LIBOR rate (more on that in a moment) to buy invest with higher returns. The differ head out to investor in the form of dividends.It' whi CSQ can hold stock with middl dividend yields, likeApple, Inc.(NASAQ:AAPL) andJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM), yet hand it sharehold a 9.0% payout.7 Dividend Stock With Yield That Grow Like WeedsSo it' no wonder CEF investor are concerned. But histori suggest now isnotth time to avoid the space-it' time to get greedi for yield instead.To see why, let' look at the last rising-r period, from Juli 2004 through June 2006. Back then, the 3-month LIBOR rate, which move in lockstep with the Fed fund rate, spike to 5.48%. And at 1.7% at the outset, LIBOR wa start at a much higher baselin than today' 1.1%.That' an explosion-and it should havedemolishedCEFs, right?Wrong.Of the 10 largest CEF by asset under manag (AUM) today, six were around then-and all post double-digit total return dure that two-year span.What' more, their averag return of 17.4% best the S&P 500' 17.0%.And three - theNuveen AMT-Fre Municip Credit Incom Fund(NYSE:NVG), theNuveen California Qualiti Municip Incom Fund(NYSE:NAC) and theNuveen Municip Credit Incom Fund(NYSE:NZF)-beat the market handily.Muni-Bond CEF Rose With Rates…It' true that all three of these are municipal-bond funds, which are the biggest CEF categori by AUM. But popular stock-bas CEF - such as CSQ and theGabelli Dividend & Incom Trust(NYSE:GDV),run by fame valu investor Mario Gabelli - did just fine, too:… And So Did Equiti FundsTh bottom line?We'v still got alongway to go (and like not in thi rate-hik cycle) befor rise rate becom a signific headwind for CEFs. And we can give ourselv some extra protect by zero in on fund with reason leverage.That' easy: right now, the averag CEF' leverag is equal to 33% of AUM, so ani fund with a ratio below that will have less to fear from higher borrow costs. CSQ qualifies, at 29.8%, as doe GDV, at just 23.9%.Mi No. 1 Rule: Buy the Disappear DiscountSo put your rate fear aside.Becaus there' someth els that will have afargreat impact on your CEF returns: a fund' discount to net asset valu (NAV), and more important,wheth manag ha a plan to narrow that discount.Here' what I'm talk about…Unlik an ETF, a CEF can't issu new share after it IPO. That mean the fund can (and mani do) trade at a discount to NAV.That' great for us, becaus it' basic free money.Right now, for example, GDV, which yield a nice 6.3%, trade at a 9.8% discount to NAV, so we'r get $1 of asset for just $0.90! But that doesn't mean much to us if that discount window never closes, as is the case with the vast major of CEFs.How can it close?On way is if manag simpli shutter the fund. For example, Gabelli could close GDV today and give investor $23.10 in cash (the NAV) per share, rather than the $20.91 GDV trade for. In reality, the share would like jump to that level, which is what happen when the Allianz Intern & Premium Strategi Fund shut down at the end of 2013.Other times, a CEF discount can simpli disappear asinvestor pile into a hot sector.Tak theJohn Hancock Financi Opportun Fund(NYSE:BTO), which wa trade at a 3.8% discount 13 month ago. Fast-forward to today, and BTO trade at a 2.6%premiumto NAV after investor flock to financials. The result 56.4% jump in NAVandth elimin of the discount sent the share up 69.2% in just 13 months!Discount Vanishes, BTO SoarsWatch for a CEF Buyback BoostFor those of us with less luck than folk hold BTO or the shutter Allianz fund I mention earlier, there' anoth way a fund' manag can juic it gains: share buybacks.And here' where a manag team with a keen eye for valu can make a big difference.Tak BTO. Last year, manag Lisa Welch, Susan Curri and Ryan Lentel help close the fund' discount by repurchas 10,000 shares, up from zero in 2015. (They'r also author to buy up to 10% of BTO' outstand share thi year, but I expect they'll hold off now that the fund trade at a premium.)Meantim over at GDV, Gabelli can buy back share anytim the fund trade at a discount greater than 7.5%. That wa the case last year, when the markdown averag 11.3%. Gabelli, for hi part, did better than that, buy back 117,996 share at an averag discount of roughli 13.7% from NAV.Well-tim buyback like these are gift that keep on giving. Not onli do they help close the discount window, but they also lift NAV per share as the stock is remov from the market.Th problem? All three of these CEF lean heavili toward stocks, and when stock got crush in 2008, all three saw their NAV evaporate: CSQ' plung 51%, GDV' by 46% and BTO' by 37%.I don't want to get hit like that when thenextcrash comes-and I don't want you to, either. That' whi I recommend diversifi by ad other type of fund trade at even deeper discount than these three-in the 10% to 15% range.Lik the 3 CEF in my new""No-Withdraw retir portfolio.""Their fat discount mean these stealth fund will simpli trade flat the next time the market craters.Mor likely, the herd will quickli get over it interest rate fears-especi after the Fed sound a cautiou note on last week' hike-and pile in, banish those discount in a hurry!10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashTranslation:Quick double-digit upsid for you and me.Then there are the dividends.With payout of 8.2%, 9.9% and even 10.1%,you can drop, say, $400,000 into these 3 beautiesand trigger a nice $38,000 incom stream-start today!Th time to buy is now … befor the rate fear die down and our chanc to buy cheap evaporates.Click here to get the name of these 3 CEF and the other high-yield invest insid my uniqu portfolio now.Mor From InvestorPlace7 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are Actual Safe10 Mutual Fund You Can Buy and Hold ForeverTh postMi No. 1 Rule for Safe 8% Yield and 15% Upsid in CEFsappear first onInvestorPlace."

Over the past three years, for instance, it' trade between trade between $4-$7, and narrowli between $5-$6 over the last 12 months.Incom investor will be interest in Ambev' 3% dividend yield. However, Brazil ha been a seriou challeng for the company, and that ha hurt the overal business. Everywher else, busi is strong.Year-to-date, ABEV stock is up 13% as investor bet Brazil will rebound. I think that' a smart bet.Cencosud SA (CNCO)Th contrarian in me just love the idea of bet on retail - in Latin America. How crazi is that? But the truth is, while retail might suck in North America, it' veri much in a growth phase in place like Chile where retail conglomerateCencosud SA(NYSE:CNCO) is based.Cencosud oper depart stores, groceri store and home improv store in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. It also own shop center and a financi servic business, make it a vertic integr retail conglomerate.CNCO want to be the largest retail in Latin America and ha made great stride in the past five years, grow revenu from $9.3 billion in 2010 to $15.4 billion in 2016, an 8.9% compound annual growth rate. In 2016, it adjust EBITDA wa $1.1 billion for a 7.4% adjust EBITDA margin.It pay a small dividend, but that' not whi you want to own CNCO stock.Aegon N.V.

Right now, AEG is look good.Bottom Line on Nokia StockFrom a dividend perspective, there' no question Nokia stock is veri attractive. However, from a growth perspective, I'd actual be more excit by Cencosud, and to a lesser extent, Aegon.I Nokia stock the best foreign large-cap under $10?

Wait for the Right Entry Into Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock,3/20/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSinc reach an all-tim high in earli February,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ha been sputtering, lose roughli 13%. Thi is despit the strong bull move in the overal market.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo might the current valu of NVDA stock be at an attract level now? Or mayb it' a better idea to hold off?Well, the fact is that Nvidia remain one of the best oper in the semiconductor industry, with a domin posit in graphic process unit (GPUs). While thi technolog is still primarili for game - which continu to be a solid market opportun - the applic span emerg categories, such as artifici intelligence, virtual reality, self-driv cars, internet of thing and cloud computing. The main reason is that GPU can process enorm amount of data on a cost-effect basis.And yes, NVDA ha had littl troubl monet it valuabl assets. Just look at the most recent quarter, in whichrevenu spike by 55%to $2.17 billion and the adjust earn came to $1.13 per share. The Street, on the other hand, wa look for $2.11 billion and earn of 83 cent on NVDA stock.It wa certainli a blow-out. But interestingli enough, it didn't realli matter - that is, at least for NVDA stock. Then again, much of the stori is bake into the valuation. Consid that the price-earn ratio is at about 40. By comparison,Texa Instrument Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN) sport a multipl of 23 andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) trade at 16.5.4 Famou Tech Stock That Could Lose Their FangsGranted, NVDA stock deserv a premium valuat becaus of it torrid growth ramp. But accord tosever notabl Wall Street analysts, the current multipl appear to still be at frothi levels.Dur the past coupl weeks, Instinet analyst Romit Shah put a price target of $90 on NVDA stock and analyst from BMO Capit Market went even lower, with a $85 price target. Actually, the Wall Street consensu is for $113.59 a share, which impli onli 9% upside. But it is import to note that there are some notabl risk factors, which could easili weigh on Nvidia stock as well.Tak a look atAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), which ha been pull off a stun turnaround. The company' latest GPU have gotten much more competit and will like make inroad with NVDA, especi becaus of the low pricing.There'seven buzzthat INTC will get more cozi with AMD, which would put a crimp in the sale of Nvidia (the deal with INTC and NVDA end at the end of thi month). Alreadi AMD ha snag deal with biggi likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Alibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) for cloud-comput and deep-learn systems.Speak of INTC, the compani may also be a threat becaus ofit recent $15.3 billion acquisitionofMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY) for a cool $15.3 billion. The deal will instantli make it a top player in the fast-grow tech market for auto systems. And yes, INTC can leverag it global custom base, which will like mean troubl for NVDA.Whi I Sold Appl Inc.

FEY stock got a 6%-plu pop as BofA share a ""Buy"" rate and an $18 price target - a whop 70% better than Friday' close.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)It' hard to be inspir right now. Bearish ha been right high becaus valuat - rel to futur growth - are unfavorable. Manag shuffl and a light forecast from FEY also suggest that FireEy will have limit upsid for investor in the near-term.But BofA see what I see - that in the long-term, FEY stock could pan out.Th FundamentalsLast month, FireEy report flat (year-over-year) fourth-quart revenu growth of $184.7 million. Oper margin improv to -1%. The compani forecast Q1 revenu of as low as $160 million, while analyst expect FEY would gener $177 million in revenue.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashTh compani clearli is in a turnaround phase, but until the sale team transit stabilizes, short-term pain in FEY stockwillcontinue.Last quarter, FireEy revenu suffer due to the limit releas of new products. It sale team had vacanc that need filling, leav a massiv gap in leadership. But the compani had no head of sale for the worldwid or Europ divisions. The company' Middl East and Japan unit underw sale manag transitions, too.Th impact on result is veri clear: FireEy did not meet analyst expectations.Investor may anticip sale improv sometim in the next few quarters, depend on the product of the new sale team. Fix the intern sale process will result in better profitability. On it confer call, FEY manag said:W are also work across the board to minim the number of deal that go through our non-standard price process, or NSP process, so partner can control their margin and shorten their sale cycle.FEY ha a believ plan to turn around and restructur it sale division. The problem is simpli one of timing.FireEy ValuationWith the stock price hover near yearli lows, some, if not all, of the risk of a fail turnaround are price into FireEy shares.Bi assum a discount rate of between 11.5%-12.5%, FEY stock is worth 12.5% more than current levels. Conversely, if revenu continu falling, the fair valu base on futur cash flow impli a lower share price. BofA doesn't see that as happening, though.""W think the Street larg ignor management' guidanc for growth resumpt in 2H17, which is an opportun for a posit surprise,"" say analyst Tal Liani.There' headlin support here, too. The demand level for cybersecur solut is unpredictable. Whenev the public hear about a secur breach, though, the news drive the stock price up.

Revenu growth is slow at first, but when it pick up, profit soars.Radcom Ltd.(NASDAQ:RDCM), a supplier of qualiti assur solut for the telecom industry, also move toward a subscript model with great success.Bottom Line on FEY StockLast month, rumor thatSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) would buy FireEy prove short-lived. Symantec is alreadi absorbingBluecoatSystems. It doe not need the oper risk relat to ad FEYE' cybersecur solut to it suit of products.Still, FireEy doe offer detect capabilities.

My No. 1 Rule for Safe 8% Yields and 15% Upside in CEFs,3/20/2017,"By Brett OwensThink of avoid closed-end funds, now that we'v got anoth Fed rate hike in the books?It' easi to see why, with the ""smart money""--trad bet through the Fed fund futur market--expect anoth hike just three month from now. In all, the market' call for three hike thi year, and so is Janet Yellen.makeArticleAd();On Down, Two to Go?But if you let that scare you away from high-yield sector like CEFs, real estat invest trust and prefer shares, you'll miss out on some seriou income.In a moment, I'll show you how to pick theCEF with the most upside, along with the high payout these fund are known for.First, here' whi I'm pound the tabl on them now.Bust a Big CEF MythWhen mani folk think of CEFs, the first word that come to mind is leverage, and the risk that funds' borrow cost will spike along with rates.And it' certainli true that borrow cash play a big part in CEFs' outsiz dividend payouts.Tak theCalamo Strateg Total Return Fund (CSQ),one of the oldest equity-bas CEF (CSQ hold 63% of it portfolio in common stocks, with the rest in corpor bonds, convert bond and prefer shares).Thank to leverage, the fund' manag team can borrow cheaply, at around the LIBOR rate (more on that in a moment) to buy invest with higher returns. The differ head out to investor in the form of dividends.It' whi CSQ can hold stock with middl dividend yields, likeAppl (AAPL)andJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), yet hand it sharehold a 9.0% payout.So it' no wonder CEF investor are concerned. But histori suggest now isnotth time to avoid the space--it' time to get greedi for yield instead.To see why, let' look at the last rising-r period, from Juli 2004 through June 2006. Back then, the 3-month LIBOR rate, which move in lockstep with the Fed fund rate, spike to 5.48%. And at 1.7% at the outset, LIBOR wa start at a much higher baselin than today' 1.1%.That' an explosion--and it should havedemolishedCEFs, right?Wrong.Of the 10 largest CEF by asset under manag (AUM) today, six were around then--and all post double-digit total return dure that two-year span. What' more, their averag return of 17.4% best the S&P 500' 17.0%.And three--theNuveen AMT-Fre Municip Credit Incom Fund (NVG),theNuveen California Qualiti Municip Incom Fund (NAC)and theNuveen Municip Credit Incom Fund (NZF)-- beat the market handily.Muni-Bond CEF Rose With Rates...It' true that all three of these are municipal-bond funds, which are the biggest CEF categori by AUM. But popular stock-bas CEFs--such as CSQ and theGabelli Dividend & Incom Trust (GDV),run by fame valu investor Mario Gabelli--did just fine, too:... And So Did Equiti FundsTh bottom line?We'v still got alongway to go (and like not in thi rate-hik cycle) befor rise rate becom a signific headwind for CEFs. And we can give ourselv some extra protect by zero in on fund with reason leverage.That' easy: right now, the averag CEF' leverag is equal to 33% of AUM, so ani fund with a ratio below that will have less to fear from higher borrow costs. CSQ qualifies, at 29.8%, as doe GDV, at just 23.9%.Mi No. 1 Rule: Buy the Disappear DiscountSo put your rate fear aside.Becaus there' someth els that will have afargreat impact on your CEF returns: a fund' discount to net asset valu (NAV), and more important,wheth manag ha a plan to narrow that discount.Here' what I'm talk about: unlik an ETF, a CEF can't issu new share after it IPO. That mean the fund can (and mani do) trade at a discount to NAV.That' great for us, becaus it' basic free money.Right now, for example, GDV, which yield a nice 6.3%, trade at a 9.8% discount to NAV, so we'r get $1 of asset for just $0.90! But that doesn't mean much to us if that discount window never closes, as is the case with the vast major of CEFs.How can it close?On way is if manag simpli shutter the fund. For example, Gabelli could close GDV today and give investor $23.10 in cash (the NAV) per share, rather than the $20.91 GDV trade for. In reality, the share would like jump to that level, which is what happen when the Allianz Intern & Premium Strategi Fund shut down at the end of 2013.Other times, a CEF discount can simpli disappear asinvestor pile into a hot sector.Tak theJohn Hancock Financi Opportun Fund (BTO),which wa trade at a 3.8% discount 13 month ago. Fast-forward to today, and BTO trade at a 2.6%premiumto NAV after investor flock to financials. The result 56.4% jump in NAVandth elimin of the discount sent the share up 69.2% in just 13 months!Discount Vanishes, BTO SoarsWatch for a Buyback BoostFor those of us with less luck than folk hold BTO or the shutter Allianz fund I mention earlier, there' anoth way a fund' manag can juic it gains: share buybacks.And here' where a manag team with a keen eye for valu can make a big difference.Tak BTO. Last year, manag Lisa Welch, Susan Curri and Ryan Lentel help close the fund' discount by repurchas 10,000 shares, up from zero in 2015. (They'r also author to buy up to 10% of BTO' outstand share thi year, but I expect they'll hold off now that the fund trade at a premium.)Meantim over at GDV, Gabelli can buy back share anytim the fund trade at a discount greater than 7.5%. That wa the case last year, when the markdown averag 11.3%. Gabelli, for hi part, did better than that, buy back 117,996 share at an averag discount of roughli 13.7% from NAV.Well-tim buyback like these are gift that keep on giving. Not onli do they help close the discount window, but they also lift NAV per share as the stock is remov from the market.Th problem? All three of these CEF lean heavili toward stocks, and when stock got crush in 2008, all three saw their NAV evaporate: CSQ' plung 51%, GDV' by 46% and BTO' by 37%.I don't want to get hit like that when thenextcrash comes--and I don't want you to, either. That' whi I recommend diversifi by ad other type of fund trade at even deeper discount than these three--in the 10% to 15% range.Lik the 3 CEF in my new""No-Withdraw retir portfolio.""Their fat discount mean these stealth fund will simpli trade flat the next time the market craters.Mor likely, the herd will quickli get over it interest rate fears--especi after the Fed sound a cautiou note on last week' hike--and pile in, banish those discount in a hurry!Translation:Quick double-digit upsid for you and me.Then there are the dividends.With payout of 8.2%, 9.9% and even 10.1%,you can drop, say, $400,000 into these 3 beautiesand trigger a nice $38,000 incom stream--start today!Th time to buy is now ... befor the rate fear die down and our chanc to buy cheap evaporates.Click here to get the name of these 3 CEF and the other high-yield invest insid my uniqu portfolio now."

No home button mean that the Touch ID will have to be integr into the display itself -- an applic that Synapt alreadi special in.In Decemb last year, Synapt launch it FS9100 optic fingerprint sensor that elimin the need for a home button in smartphon and tablets. The sensor can scan fingerprint through 1mm of glass, and can be place conveni toward the bottom of the front bezel, beneath the cover glass of the mobil device.Cowen and Compani analyst Timothi Arcuri' suppli chain check (viaAppleInsider) indic that Appl could end up use thi solut from Synaptics:Arcuri reiter those claims, and predict that Appl may switch to Synaptics' optical-bas fingerprint reader for the new Touch ID sensor, cite it as ""current the onli workabl solution"" for detect a fingerprint through a smartphon screen.Synapt will start sampl these fingerprint sensor to custom in the first quarter of 2017, with mass product set to begin in the second quarter.

Apple Dividend: Is a Big Increase Coming Soon?,3/19/2017,"Five year ago today,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) announc plan to start pay a dividend for the first time sinc 1995. Sinc then, Appl ha rais it dividend at a steadi but rel modest pace. Meanwhile, Apple' origin $10 billion share repurchas plan (announc at the same time) ha morph into a massiv $175 billion share buyback program over the past few years.Appl will announc the latest updat to it capit return program next month in conjunct with it Q2 earn report. Thi time around, the iPhon maker may final start to rais it dividend at a faster pace.Apple' dividend historyAppl paid the first dividend under it current capit return program in August 2012. At that time, the quarterli payout wa $2.65 per share. Adjust for Apple' 2014 stock split, thi translat to a dividend of about $0.38 per share.makeArticleAd();Each April sinc then, Appl ha rais it dividend. The biggest increas came in 2013, when Appl rais it dividend by 15%. The smallest increas (8%) came the follow year. The averag annual increas ha been about 11%.Appl restart it dividend in 2012. It ha been grow ever since. Imag source: Apple.In total, Apple' payout ha grown by about 50% dure thi period. For the past year, it quarterli dividend ha been $0.57 per share.Appl can afford to pay moreCommon metric of dividend safeti indic that Appl could afford to pay a lot more to it shareholders. It current ha a payout ratio of just 27% base on it earn over the past year. A payout ratio twice as high would still be consid safe by most experts.Mani investor prefer to measur dividend safeti by look at free cash flow. After all, if a compani is not gener enough free cash flow to cover it dividend, then it ha to issu debt or stock to plug the gap.Appl is in good shape from thi perspect as well. The compani gener more than $52 billion of free cash flow last year, while it current quarterli dividend of $0.57 per share work out to about $12.5 billion per year for dividend payments.Th case for a hefti increaseTher are two main reason whi Appl should consid a bigger dividend increas than ha been it recent custom.First, Apple' dividend yield ha fallen significantli sinc the April 2016 updat to it capit return program. When Appl rais it dividend last April, the new $0.57 per share quarterli payment work out to a 2.2% annual yield. Now, thank to Apple' surg share price, the dividend yield ha fallen to just 1.6%.Second, withAppl stockrec reach a record high of $140, share buyback seem less attract than they have been for most of the past five years. Apple' earn multipl is near the high end of it recent histor range, which suggest that the stock is not a huge bargain right now.Appl P/E Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Dividend and share repurchas are just two altern way to return cash to shareholders. As a result, if buyback are gener diminish return due to Apple' rise stock price, it might make sens to shift the capit return program' emphasi toward dividends.A 20%-30% dividend hike could be comingSinc Appl restart it dividend in late 2012, it dividend yield ha averag about 2%. Just to get back to a 2% yield, the quarterli payout would have to rise 23% to $0.70 per share, base on Apple' recent stock price. There' a good chanc that Appl will announc a dividend increas of roughli thi magnitud next month.In the past year or so, Apple' manag ha place an increas amount of emphasi on the company' servic segment. One of the big strength of the servic busi is that it gener reliabl recur revenue, wherea devic sale fluctuat due to product cycles.If Apple' cash flow is set to becom more predict in the future, then the compani should start to behav more like other cash-cow businesses.

Over the past nearli 20 years, Appl ha disrupt and come to domin multipl industries, chang the way peopl listen to -- and buy -- music, use computers, and interact with technolog in their everyday lives. It' not a stretch to say that Apple, if not invented, then perfected, the mobil comput era.And with it stock trade around 17 time last year' earn -- a substanti discount to the averag P/E of theS&P 500-- there' a case to be made that the iStuff compani is actual undervalued.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();But a state-own behemoth, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, better-known as Saudi Aramco, is set to blow past Appl for the titl of world' most valuabl public compani when it IPO in 2018. Expect are that the market will valu Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion or more.Here' a closer look at how massiv thi megacompany, which control an enorm percentag of the world' oil, realli is, as well as whi Saudi Arabia is consid take it public.Saudi Aramco' valu is in the oil it controlsAt that $2 trillion valuation, Saudi Aramco would be the biggest public compani on the planet by a veri wide margin. But the most tell measur of it size is how it compar to the biggest public compani in oil and gas:In billions. Chart by author.Th 13 public compani list on the chart abov are some of the biggest in the oil and ga industry. Some, likeExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM)BP(NYSE: BP)Royal Dutch Shell(NYSE: RDS-A) (NYSE: RDS-B) , are fulli integr major with asset across the oil and ga valu chain, while others, likeEnterpris ProductsandPhillip 66, are domin particip in specif part of the industry, such as transportation, refining, or petrochem manufacturing. The list also includesPetrobras(NYSE: PBR) andPetroChina(NYSE: PTR) , the Brazilian and Chines state-control integr oil companies.Combin (red bar in the tabl above) these 13 public entiti are worth $1.5 billion at current share prices. That mean Saudi Aramco is expect to be worth $500 billion more when it goe public next year than the next 13 biggest oil companiesput together. That' a baker's-dozen of the world' biggest oil companies, plusMicrosoftjust for good measure.Ther are two factor that drive thi value: How much oil it produces, and how much it hold the right to produce. Here' how Saudi Aramco' daili oil and ga product compar to the other biggest public producers:In million of barrel of oil equival per day (Boe/d). Chart by author. Data source: Compani report and filings.At more than 12 million barrel of oil-equival per day, Saudi Aramco produc more oil and natur ga than the next three biggest, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP, combined.Here' how Saudi Aramco' massiv oil and natur ga reserv compare:In billion of barrel of oil equivalent.

Anchor by the massiv Ghawar oilfield, the compani control sever of the biggest oilfield on the planet, with some of the lowest cash product costs.To be clear, Aramco doesn't own Saudi Arabia' oilfields. Those are Saudi govern property. But it doe have exclus product rights, much in the same way other oil compani pay properti owner for the right to access and produc oil and gas.Us the biggest-ev IPO to fuel a post-oil Saudi ArabiaWhen Aramco goe public, it is expect to rais more than $100 billion, sell 5% of the compani to investors.

Chart by author.Aramco' IPO is expect to rais almost as much capit as the next five biggest, combined.Thi is a step toward a ""post-oil"" Saudi Arabia. Led by Saudi Deputi Crown Princ Moham Bin Salman, the Saudi Aramco IPO is part of a bigger initi -- transfer a number of kingdom-own compani to the kingdom' sovereign wealth fund as part of it strategi to shift more of the country' economi away from the oil and ga industri which overwhelmingli domin it today.Th sovereign wealth fund ha alreadi been given stake in two major Saudi companies: Saudi Basic Industries, one of the world' largest chemic manufacturers, and Nation Commerci Bank, Saudi Arabia' biggest lender. The plan is for thi fund to control $2 trillion in assets, and then use the profit they gener to plant the seed of econom expans outsid the oil patch.Saudi Aramco isn't target individu investors, either. It ideal investor would be institut owner such as pension fund and other sovereign wealth funds. Accord to recent news, China' $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Invest Corp, is in talk to be a major investor in the IPO.Look forwardWhen Saudi Aramco doe go public, it' almost certainli go to becom the biggest public compani on earth, and will rais the most capit ever from an IPO.Should individu investor put it stock on their watch lists? There' a chanc that it could make for a solid incom investment, with what are gener consid the world' lowest cash product cost make it oil product profit in ani environment.But for a litani reasons, it' far too earli to make that call.Frankly, there' a lot investor need to know about Aramco befor put their capit at risk, and it' far from clear how much of inform thi ultra-secret compani is go to make avail to outsiders. Thi veri well could prevent it from go public on American or European exchanges, where stringent disclosur regul may requir the compani to reveal more than the Saudi govern is will to let be made public about it reserv and cost of production.If that prove to be the case, individu investor should probabl take it as a cue to avoid Aramco, no matter how big it oil reserv are, or how cheapli they can be extracted.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Apple Is a Better Value Stock Than Corning,3/17/2017,"At least at some level, invest can be a lot like a spi novel. A narr might appear one way at first onli to chang as new detail emerge; thing are rare exactli as they first seem.Thi idea certainli hold true in compar tech companiesApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andCorning(NYSE: GLW) . Trade at roughli half of Apple' valuation, the superfici number would suggest that Corn is clearli the better buy. However, for the three reason you will see below, the number alon fail to tell the entir story. Here' whi Appl is a better valu stock to buy today than Corning.1. Corn isn't as cheap as it looksTh sheer cheap of it stock jump out immedi when look at Corning. At a time when theS&P 500trade at roughli 26 time earn -- admittedli well abov it own histor norm -- Corn stock current trade hand at a minuscul 8.5 time earnings. However, thi also contain an import invest lesson: Stock tend to trade at such seemingli preposter discount for a reason.makeArticleAd();Cas in point: Corn book a $2.6 billion gain on the revalu of one of it equiti invest dure it fiscal 2016, which inflat it pre-tax incom by roughli 190% on the year. With it earn per share (EPS) expect to grow at 8% thi year, Corning' 15.3 forward P/E ratio serv as a far better indic of the company' actual valuat than it current P/E. Again, the alarm bell should go off ani time you see the share of a healthi compani like Corn trade at so seemingli cheap a valuation. Corn isn't nearli as cheap as it appear at first glance.Imag source: Apple.2. Appl is cheaper than it looksJust as Corn isn't as cheap as it looks, the valu of Apple' core oper busi is actual far lower than it P/E suggests. The underli reason is fairli well document at thi point; Apple' net cash surplu total $158.6 billion in it most recent quarterli filing. Subtract thi stagger figur from Apple' market capit reduc it valuat to $570.6 billion.Us thi net-cash-adjust market cap as the numer to Apple' P/E ratio provid an updat valuat for the Mac maker of just 12.6 time earnings, which is significantli lower than Corning' valuat metric after remov the effect of the one-tim account gain it record thi year. Seen thi way, Appl actual offer investor better value, though thi line of reason doe littl to factor in either company' growth outlook. However, the invest thesi turn even more in Apple' favor upon ad in the companies' long-term return profiles.3. Apple' growth outlook beat Corning'sNot to belabor the point, but compar Apple' forward growth rate against those of Corn support the same conclusion. Look to the top line, consensu Wall Street estim call for Appl to increas it sale by 5.9% thi year and 7.5% next year. Meanwhile, Corn is expect to see it sale rise 3.4% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017. The same relationship -- Appl slightli outgrow Corn -- also appli to sell-sid estim for the two companies' earn per share.Much of thi is like attribut to Apple' expect debut of a fulli redesign 10th anniversari iPhon thi fall. Corning, of course, will benefit from Apple' latest iPhon as a compon supplier for the handset. However, Appl will certainli benefit far more from the highli anticip device.Beyond sale and earn growth, Apple' gigant -- and grow -- cash surplu give the compani far more flexibl to enhanc overal sharehold return through increas dividend and buybacks. The compani can also invest heavili in futur growth initi like electr car or digit stream content without affect it current earn outlook. At the end of the day, although Corn is no slouch in it own right, Appl is clearli the better valu stock between the two companies.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And while you can own these individu names, perhap a better way to own these and mani other consum stapl is via ETFs.Two of my prefer fund in the consum stapl space are theConsum Stapl Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLP) and theiShar Global Consum Staple(ETF)(NYSE:KXI).Plac to Hide in a Stock Market Crash: Invers ETFsSource: ShutterstockCan't just hang around wait for the storm to pass?

Read on to find out.Sport Deal Are Roll InSoci network are a big boon for sport leagu and right holder becaus of dwindl viewership on tradit platform like TV, especi among younger audiences. Social network also facilit better interact with the event by combin viewership, commentari and reaction to a game, make it a more enjoy experience.They also help content provid reach their audienc directly, result in innov that can further person the experience. That' the reason they have been tri out event on both Facebook and Twitter.Ov the past month, Facebook sign on Major Leagu Basebal (MLB) for a game a week and Univis Commun for 46 Liga MX game (live game from Mexico' top soccer league). The Liga MX game are target at U.S. audienc onli with Tonia O'Connor, Univision' chief commerci offic and presid of content distribut expect it to better connect with and grow it English speak audience.Video Is the FutureFacebook ha launch a new TV app for AmazonAMZNFir TV, AppleAAPLTV and Samsung Smart TV, with possibl plan to further expand to other platform like MicrosoftMSFTXbox, SonySNEPlaySt and other stream devices. While thi will like enable/support longer video formats, Facebook ha said it intent is not to compet with Netflix but rather to enabl Facebook user to watch their prefer video on just about ani screen of their choic (and that includ TV screens).Of cours that' not the onli video announc Facebook made. The compani say that henceforth, video will play automat with the sound turn on by default (if the devic sound is turn on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watch the video while scroll through your newsfeed. Facebook say that test show posit reaction from user although it' obviou that not everyon will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedli in talk with music label to bring their content to the app, which seem like an open challeng to YouTube, Google' compet site. For labels, the new distribut channel will increas their leverag against YouTub for more favor terms. On the flip side, the chanc of piraci will increas given the natur of Facebook' free platform.Th increas scope for advertis is also an indic that the compani is gear up to grab it share of TV ad dollars.Tim for a VR Realiti CheckLast year saw a lot of hype relat to virtual realiti (VR), which wa bill as the next major platform for consumer-typ experi after the mobil revolution.

The longer term estim are even more optimistic: Citigroup reportedli say that the AR/VR market will gener $2.16 trillion by 2035.Near term, however, thing don't look so good, with the market do just $1.8 billion in 2016. The primari drawback to adopt seem to be compel content and softwar tailor for the VR experi and still-high price for a technolog that is still in it veri earli days.Suffici softwar won't be avail until there are big enough platforms, whether base on Occulu or Google' Daydream, which is whi the two compani are push away regardless.Devic price vari huge rang from the (HTC Vive at $799, PlayStat VR at $399 and Occulus' own Rift somewher in between at $599 without the $199 for the Touch motion controllers). Other like Microsoft, Appl and even Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl have invest in augment realiti (AR).Facebook chose the high end becaus it ha alway held that for VR to succeed, the feel must be good, not the quick-heating, nauseat experi enabl through smartphones. And becaus it want to ultim enabl social network use the technology. At ani rate, the compani ha now decid to scale back the number of Best Buy store-within-stor from 500 to 300. It' also decid to lower the price of Rift+Touch to $598. The strategi make sense: bring more peopl on the platform to financ it further development.Activist Don't Want Zuckerberg as Board ChairpersonA group of activist shareholders, part of a consum watchdog group call SumOfU have propos that an independ chairperson would better ""overse the execut of the company, improv corpor governance, and set a more accountable, pro-sharehold agenda.""

Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. Announces 7nm+ Technology,3/17/2017,"Contract chipmakerTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) ha been on a roll over the last sever years, bring out new manufactur technolog and subsequ enhanc thereof like clockwork.That pace of innov ha been one of the key reason that smartphon have gotten as ""smart"" as they are -- those advanc in manufactur have allow mobil processor design to build increasingli sophist processor while at the same time keep power consumpt low (and thu batteri life acceptable).Imag source: TSMC.makeArticleAd();TSMC is expect to significantli ramp up shipment volum on it 10nm manufactur technolog in the second half of 2017 (like in support of theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) A11 chip), and it' like that we'll see TSMC ship larg volum of it next-gener 7nm technolog in the second half of 2018 (in support of the Appl A12 chip).At a recent event, perEETimes, TSMC just out inform about the follow-on to it 7nm technology, call 7nm+. Let' look at what thi technolog promis to deliv and what it mean for TSMC and it customers, such as Apple.Area reduction, perform boostEETimesreport that TSMC is claim a 1.2 time increas in logic density, 10% more performance, or 15% lower power than the 7nm technolog that'll go into product next year.Such enhanc aren'thuge, but both the increas logic densiti as well as the higher-performance/low power should be clear wins. The addit logic densiti should allow compani like Appl to cram in more featur and function while keep chip size roughli the same and the improv transistor performance/pow should directli translat into faster processor (improv user experience) and/or lower power processor (improv batteri life).When will we see it?Accord toEETimes, TSMC plan to start risk product -- that is, small volume, trial product -- on thi second-gener 7nm+ technolog by June 2018. What' interest is that it often take about a year for TSMC to go from risk product on a technolog to mass production.If it take TSMC a full year to start mass product on 7nm+ from risk product in June 2018, that might caus schedul problem for Apple, which will need to receiv chip to build up iPhon inventori well in advanc of the typic Septemb iPhon launch time frame.That mean finish wafer of chip need to be roll off the line and be ship to Apple' contract manufactur by around June/Juli 2019, impli product start sever month beforehand.So, if I'm read what TSMC reportedli said correctly, the chipmak can't afford to wait a year to go from risk product to volum product on 7nm+ -- it'll need to pull it off in about nine month to meet Apple' need (assuming, of course, Appl stick to it typic Septemb iPhon releas schedule).Look good, TSMCOne of the thing that TSMC doe well is that it routin updat the invest commun on the progress it is make with respect to futur manufactur technolog on it quarterli earn calls. I suspect that the inform thatEETimesi report will be repeat on the company' next earn call (which should be in April), and I bet the compani will provid more specif product timelin as well as insight into the kind of demand it is see from custom for thi technology.10 stock we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Compani from the high-growth sector tend to re invest their cash into expand instead of return it to investors.makeArticleAd();However, 17 year after the dot-com bubbl pop in March of 2000, a group of former tech highflyer is quietli evolv into some of the best dividend payer in theS&P 500.Apple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a great example. Appl began pay a dividend in 2012, and now offer a 1.6% yield after grow it dividend by 27% in the last three years.With more than $200 billion in cash, I expect Appl to continu grow it dividend for year to come.Whil those stat are impressive, anoth legendari tech stock offer a better dividend yield and growth. Thi global leader pay out a 2.4% yield, a 50% premium to Apple' 1.6% yield. It ha grown it dividend by 44% in the last three years, a 63% premium to Apple.And finally, with just over $100 billion in cash on it balanc sheet, I am expect it dividend payment to grow more than 100% in the next five years.Th company,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the greatest growth stock in the histori of the Nasdaq. Sinc go public in 1986, share are up more than 66,420%.That mean $1,000 invest back then would now be worth $6.6 million today.

It' clear Microsoft is commit to reward investor with big-tim dividend growth. But thi is just the tip of the iceberg. Look forward, I am expect Microsoft' dividend to grow more than 100% in the next five years.Here' why.Whil Microsoft' day of mega growth are behind it, the compani is score big win in the high-growth cloud comput market. Accord to market research firm IDC, worldwid spend on cloud servic is expect to more than doubl by 2020 to $195 billion.Right now, Microsoft is the second-largest player in the industry, trail onlyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).

In light of thi shift. Microsoft should have no problem deliv record revenu and earn for year to come.That is go to have a big impact on the company' alreadi eye-pop balanc sheet. Microsoft current ha more than $100 billion in cash on it balanc sheet. That is a lot more capit than Microsoft could invest in growth even if it want to.Mi predict is that Microsoft will use it massiv and grow cash posit to reward investor with big-tim dividend growth - doubl it dividend within the next five years.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Still Ha More Room to RunAnd despit the strong outlook, Microsoft doesn't look overvalued. It P/E ratio of 21 is a small premium to the S&P 500' 18.Risk To Consider:Microsoft is bank on captur a larger share of the high-growth cloud comput market. It need to deliv on that goal to keep revenu grow and investor happy.Act To Take:Microsoft is quietli evolv into one of the S&P 500' best dividend stocks.

"Don't Be Fooled by the ""Tech"" Label. Apple Is a Buffett Stock.",3/17/2017,"""I don't think we'v gone crazy,""Berkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) Vice Chairman Charli Munger recent said at thi year' Daili Journal meeting, accord to aReutersreport. What wa he refer to? Berkshir Hathaway buy share of both airlin and a tech company,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , two type of busi Buffett said in earlier time he would never buy.BesidesIBM, Appl is Berkshir Hathaway' onli ""tech"" stock. Yet with tech infiltr virtual everi part of people' lives, it wa somewhat inevit that Buffett and Berkshir would go against what he'd previous said and buy more technolog focus companies.In a multi-decad invest career, one need to chang with the time and Buffett ha given us mani exampl of that.makeArticleAd();Buffett had been a vocal critic of invest inairlines,but recent reveal that last summer he invest in several. He also onc said hi favorit compani didn't requir much capital, then bought a capital-intens util and a railroad. Go even further back, Buffett origin hitch hi wagon to the Ben Graham ""cigar butt"" style of valu invest -- until Charli Munger help steer him to ""high-quality"" compani with ""moats.""Th moat philosophi is what ha been consist throughout all of Buffett' invest in the Berkshir era. What he and Munger aim to avoid most isobsolescence. When Buffett buy a stock, as he ha famous said, hi favorit hold period is ""forever."" ""If you aren't will to own a stock for ten years, "" he wrote in hi 1996 sharehold letter, ""don't even think about own it for ten minutes.""Thi is whi Buffett previous shun tech stocks. While he ha never disparag technolog for it benefit to society, tech invest is often difficult, as (a) the product detail can be difficult for non-tech-savvi peopl to understand; (b) technolog move fast, which mean that once-pow compani could be disrupt veri quickly; and (c) over time, technolog improves, but becom cheaper to make, lead to deflationari pressur in averag sell price and commoditization, which eat away at excess returns. Patent can provid onli minim protection, as technolog ""leapfrogs"" older designs, and enforc is difficult (and expensive). Indeed, candy, soda, and car insur are so much simpler.Thi is whi so mani peopl were confus by Buffett' purchas of 123 million share of Appl as of February. Ha old uncl Warren gone crazy? I'd argu no.First, I would say the era of smartphon ha been a subtl sociolog regim shift, and the smartphon era is onli 10 year old. These pocket-s supercomput are so integr to people' live that they realli are a differ categori from the flip phone of yesteryear, or an enterpris switch, or a cabl box, or a stereo, or a piec of fiber-opt cable. It is an object that peopl carri with them 24/7, that contain so much of their data, photos, video, email - basic one' entir life -- that it seem imposs to live without. Still, conced that smartphon are not mere a ""tech"" product, what is Apple' moat?Imag source: Apple.Buffett scholar and former Morningstar analyst Pat Dorsey discuss four element that can form a busi moat in hi bookTh Littl Book That Build Wealth. I would argu that Appl ha not one, but two of these moat-lik element work simultaneously. These are the power of brand and switch costs.A power brandWhil mani peopl associ brand power with how well-known a brand is, a brand moat advantag is onli present, Dorsey writes, if it chang the consumer' behavior in certain ways. The two way it doe thi are by allow the brand to sell a virtual ident product at a premium price and/or reduc buyers' search costs.An exampl of search cost would be, for instance, a price-consci consum go toAmazon.comand buy someth without even look at other websit base on the company' reput for low prices.Appl ha cultiv both of these advantag over three decades. Apple, under Steve Jobs' leadership, tailor it technolog to make it both attract and intuit for the ""everyman"" to use. While so mani compani would advertis on the basi of featur and tech, Appl reinforc it differentiated, customer-centr approach through it ""Think Different"" campaign in the late '90s, and turn it gadget into object of ador with a rebellious, cool image. As our live increasingli move to the digit world, Appl retain and reinforc it consist brand image, while other compani scrambl from one tech regim to the next, without a coher brand message.Thi is whi peopl continu to pay a price premium for Apple' product today, even if the phone ha featur similar to the cheaperSamsungGalaxy. While Appl ha onli a 12.5% share of the worldwid smartphon market, accord to Intern Data Corporation, as of the third quarter of 2016, it command an estim 91% of worldwid smartphon profits. On the latest confer call, CEO Tim Cook explain that Appl had the absolut highest number of switcher from other brand into the Appl ecosystem of ani quarter ever. Peopl buy it product without do a lot of research. It' lower buyers' search costs.Switch costsA second moat factor Dorsey discusses, which appli specif to the iPhone, is switch costs, which are how expens or complic it is to switch to a differ product. When Buffett and Ted Weschler, one of hi invest managers, have discuss Appl in recent interviews, thi is the point that come up most frequently.Imag source: Getti ImagesSwitch cost make product ""sticky,"" and are usual pertin to enterpris software, such as a database, or mainframe. Compani run so mani crucial function on these product that have to switch vendor could lead to a disastr busi disrupt or loss of data and would result in a need to retrain workers. Thi is what enabl enterpris softwar and hardwar vendor to rais their price everi year and gener fat profit margins.In a rare interview in Germany'sManag Magazin,Weschl discuss how Apple' product are abl to creat stickiness.Valu Walkran a press releas from the public that includ quot from Weschler:""A network speed ha gotten faster and faster, and with it the inform that peopl can absorb on the network, thing like photo applications, and apps, they creat a stickier ecosystem."" Statist show that there wa a high likelihood iPhon or iPad buyer would also purchas their next devic from Apple, he added: ""Onc you are fulli invest in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousand of photograph up in the cloud and you are use to the keystrok and function and where everyth is, you becom a sticki consumer.""In February, Buffett himself said in aCNBC interview:What I do know is when I take a dozen kids, as I do on Sunday out to Dairi Queen, they'r all hold their Apple, they bare can talk to me except if I'm order ice cream or someth like that. And then I ask 'em how they live their lives. And the sticki realli is something. I mean, they do build their live around it, just like you were describing. And the interest thing is, when they come in to ... when they come in to get a new one, they'r gonna get they overwhelmingli get the same product. I mean, they got their photo on it and, I mean, yeah, I know you can ... you can make some shift and all that. But they love it.Basically, as more life-crit featur are put onto smartphones, the pain of switch from one smartphon brand to anoth increases. Consid the fact that Appl is a mostli close ecosystem -- at least more so than other smartphon vendor -- the pain of switch is even more severe.Appl is build it moat on aspir product that are easi to use, which lure in peopl look to ""trade up"" and attract young people, and an ecosystem that get stickier as more of our live move onto smartphones.Given that Appl ha these two power moat factor work in concert, it' easier to see whi Buffett took a big bite.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Cypress Semiconductor Could Benefit From the Next iPhone,3/17/2017,"Imag source: Cypress Semiconductor.makeArticleAd();Cypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) share have gain more than 17% thi year thank mostli to strong fourth-quarterresultsreleas in earli February, with the semiconductor specialist trade close to it 52-week high as of thi writing.Cypress, however, is not done yet, as recent rumor regardingApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhon suggest that it busi could get a big shot in the arm.A design win would be a big dealTh Wall Street Journalha report that insid said Appl is go to ditch the Lightn connector for a USB-C port in the next iPhone. Though there is a preced for the compani use USB-C in the MacBook line, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believ otherwise. The KGI Secur analyst reportedli said in a research note obtain byAppleInsiderthat Appl could use ""Type-C power delivery"" for all the upcom iPhon thi year instead of ditch the Lightn port altogeth in favor of USB-C.It make sens for Appl to use Type-C power deliveri through the exist Lightn port instead of move to the USB-C standard, as the former is good enough to enabl fast-charg on the iPhone. The addit advantag of use USB-C is high-spe data transmission, but Kuo point out that thi is a nich applic for iPhon users, so he think Appl will stick to the exist standard.Additionally, Kuo' comment seem credibl becaus Appl ha a whole line of Lightn accessori under the MFi program on which it make money. The compani reportedli get a fee of around 10% of the wholesal cost of an accessori made under thi program. For example, an Apple-certifi Lightn to USB cabl cost around $6 at the minimum, so, that would give Appl 60 cent on the sale of each unit.But whatev the case may be, the next iPhon look to be a catalyst for Cypress. Invest research provid Needham & Compani estim that the semiconductor specialist' earn could increas by $0.11 to $0.19 per share on revenu gain of $87.5 million to $157.5 million dure the next iPhon cycl if Appl ditch Lightn for a USB-C port. By comparison, Cypress' adjust earn last quarter were $0.15 per share on revenu of $530 million.Even if Appl decid to continu use the Lightn port with Type-C power delivery, Kuo believ that Cypress will win a spot to suppli power deliveri chip to enabl thi technology. Cypress is a lead provid of Type-C control with $295 million worth of design win in thi market, so it could be on it way to take advantag of the next iPhone' upgrad charg technology.Cypress previou suppli onli compon for Appl accessories, such as a programm chip for the AirPods. Therefore, a spot in the next iPhon would be a big win for it as the Cupertino-bas smartphon giant is expect to make 250 million to 350 million unit of the device.Moreover, a closer look at the company' fourth-quart confer call transcript (viaSeek Alpha) reveal that Cypress might be gear up for the iPhon product ramp-up in the second half of the year. In respons to a question, Cypress CEO Hassan El-Khouri said:But if you look at the market for Type-C, the expect from my side is, that ramp is go to happen in the second half of 2017, and that' realli a typic design-in behavior. So we will see slight growth in the March quarter, but primarili would expect us to grow much harder in the second half.A potenti Galaxi S8 bonusAppl might not be the onli one drive growth in Cypress' Type-C controllers. Needham expect theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi S8 to come equip with USB-C charg capabilities. Thi isn't surpris as thi charg standard is fast replac the micro USB in Android smartphones.Leak imag of the Galaxi S8 indic that the Korean smartphon will inde come with a USB-C port and Cypress ha been a longtim compon supplier to Samsung, so a USB-C port win in the next flagship devic is quit likely.A thing stand, Needham expect Samsung to sell somewher between 30 million and 60 million Galaxi S8 devices, with Cypress get dollar content of $1 to $1.50 in each phone. Thi put it potenti revenu from the next Samsung flagship in the rang of $30 million to $90 million, with earn come in between $0.04 and $0.10 per share.Cypress Semiconductor seem on track for two big smartphon design win thi year that could substanti enhanc it financi performance.10 stock we like better than Cypress SemiconductorWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Risk for This Apple Inc. Supplier Emerges,3/16/2017,"For years,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) wa the sole manufactur ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) A-seri applic processors. However, begin with the A8 system-on-a-chip, Samsung lost that busi toTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) .Samsung would win back a portion of the follow-on A9 order (Samsung and TSMC split those orders, and it is believ that Samsung receiv a major allocation), but TSMC won the entireti of the A10 orders.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();It is gener believ that TSMC ha also won the entireti of the follow-on A11 processor orders. Those chip are expect to be manufactur in TSMC' new 10-nanomet manufactur technology.However, a new report from Korean public ETNew claim that Samsung is ""expect that it can recov Apple' foundri suppli that were taken by Taiwan' TSMC by oper 7-nano product lines.""Samsung' appar hunger to win back busi from TSMC is a clear risk to the latter.A12 probabl isn't at risk, but what about A13?Samsung went into mass product on it 10-nanomet LPE in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ha publicli said that it expect to begin volum product of the follow-on to thi technology, known as 10-nanomet LPP, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Samsung ha said that it aim to begin mass product of it 7-nanomet technolog in 2018, and given the schedul around 10-nanomet LPE/LPP, I'd guess that Samsung is aim forlate2018 product start for it 7-nanomet technology.What thi suggest is this: TSMC is unlik to be at risk of lose A12 busi to Samsung as the latter' 7-nanomet technolog will be too late to market to support the A12, while TSMC ha indic that it plan to begin mass product on it 7-nanomet technolog in the first half of 2018.It' the potenti A13 busi that could be at risk from an aggress push from Samsung.Don't count TSMC out, thoughSamsung seem to be plan some aggress technic move with it 7-nanomet technolog -- it'sreportedli planningto move to a new transistor structur call a Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor that promis to allow chipmak to continu to make transistor smaller.However, TSMC ha indic that in 2019 it intend to roll out a performance-enhanc variant of it 7-nanomet technology.Ther are a lot of factor that will drive Apple' decis of where it plan to manufactur it next-gener A-seri processor -- both busi and technic -- so tri to guess where Appl will build it next-gener processor is difficult.It' worth noting, though, that TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu said on the company' Q3 2016 earn call that he expect TSMC' market share dure the 7-nanomet technolog gener will be ""higher than 10-nanometer"" and that TSMC' aim is for each new manufactur technolog to enjoy higher market share than the prior-gener technology.It'd be hard for TSMC to achiev higher market share in the 7-nanomet gener rel to the 10-nanomet gener if it end up lose a signific portion of Apple' busi to Samsung. Thi lead me to believ that TSMC is confid that it can maintain it sole-sourc posit at Apple, but onli time will tell if that confid is deserved.10 stock we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It wa the most valuabl compani in the worldCisco' price surg to nearli $80 at the apex of the dot-com bubbl in March 2000, make it the most valuabl compani in the world with a market cap of $500 billion. However, that ralli wasn't sustainable, sinc the stock wa trade at nearly240 timesearnings. The bubbl popped, and Cisco' subsequ plung made it a cautionari tale of the dot-com bust.Cisco stocknev came close to it dot-com bubbl level again. Today, Cisco ha a market cap of just over $170 billion and trade at 18 time earnings.

It use to make camerasBack in 2009, Cisco tri to expand it presenc in consum electron by buy Pure Digit Technologies, the maker of the popular Flip Video camcorders, for $590 million. At the time, Cisco state that connect those camera to the internet would allow ""peopl to share, publish, and [easily] get access to video,"" which fit it ""vision of visual networking.""That proclam sound veri similar to the strategyGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) unveil five year later. At the time of the acquisition, Flip camera account for 75% of the handheld digit camcord market. But just like GoPro' cameras, Flip video camera were gradual render obsolet by smartphon -- and Cisco quietli kill the Flip two year later.5. It sold it set-top box busi to TechnicolorIn 2005, Cisco acquir set-top box maker Scientif Atlanta for $6.9 billion to beef up it video stream technologies. Those technolog strengthen Cisco' servic provid video and collabor products, but the set-top box themselv were a dead weight on it top line growth.That' whi Cisco sold the set-top box busi toTechnicolorfor $600 million in late 2015. That' also whi Cisco ha report two set of top line result over the past few quarters. Last quarter, it total revenu fell 3% annually, but onli fell 2% after exclud the impact of the set-top box busi across all compar periods.6. Cybersecur is it fastest grow businessCisco' fastest-grow busi is it cybersecur unit, which grew it revenu by 14% annual to $528 million last quarter and account for 6% of it product revenues. Cisco ha been aggress expand that busi through big invest and acquisitions.It also bundl it secur product with it network hardwar and software, which give it tremend leverag against smaller stand-alon secur compani likeFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) -- which is frequent cite as apotenti takeov targetfor the company.Th key takeawaysCisco may be a ""mature"" tech stock which is own for incom instead of growth today, but investor shouldn't neglect it color histori as a Stanford comput scienc project, the world' most valuabl company, an aspir connect camera maker, and a grow cybersecur company.

That would give us a lot more confid go forward; otherwise, our stop would kick in on the first few red days.Less than 30 day ago, I share atrad that wa design to be a sure thing. Almost $4 per contract in profit came fast. Today, with those profit in my pocket, I want to ""rang trade"" Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a littl specul risk in our portfolio.Th short stori of Alphabet is that fundament it' as solid as it gets. It' the king of search, and that' a cash cow that just keep get fatter. So with a trail price-to-earn ratio of 30, GOOGL' potenti is built in somewhat … but I think it' not fulli built in.

How GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Stage a Comeback,3/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) had a miser 2016. Amid a litani of problem - some a result of market forces, other self-inflict - GPRO stock lost more than 50% of it valu dure the cours of the year, despit start 2016 at histor lows.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThi is a new year, but it' off to a rocki start with the announc last night that 270 posit willb eliminated.But investor love it.GPRO stock is up by double-digitsin Thursday' trade. The bull see that the compani ha a new COO, after layoff and the shutter of an underperform division, it' leaner, and GoPro' Karma drone is back on shelves.What are the odd that thi is just the begin of a GoPro turnaround, and that GPRO stock actual make investor money in 2017?After 2016, a GoPro Recoveri Isn't OptionalIt' hard to come up with an exampl of a compani that ha stumbl so badli and so repeatedly. It seem as though GPRO could do noth right in 2016.You canread the full stori here, but as a recap, the compani face rapidli declin sale of it flagship action cameras. The replac Hero 5' upgrad includ be waterproof - but that featur caus problem in production, lead to constrain suppli head into the crucial holiday season. The Karma drone it wa count on for a more divers product line wa delayed, then releas with a design flaw that led to a recall.6 Tech Stock to Buy for the VR BoomA a result, there were no Karma drone to sell over Christma and GoPro sport a promin PR black eye. The year end with earn misses, layoff and a slump GoPro stock.Start off 2017 With a New COOIn January, GoPro announc a new chief oper offic after two year with the posit unfilled. GoPro veteran CJ Prober is the new COO. In aBloombergprofile, Prober say GoPro' layoffs, elimin of it entertain divis and a flatter organ will elimin the self-inflict problem like the Karma drone issue. Team will work togeth instead of independently. Hi mantra is for 2017 is to""do more with less.""Do more includ a new version of the flagship Hero camera, improv GoPro' softwar to make it more user-friendly, and expand it line of accessories. The strategi is all about attract new action camera buyer through a deeper ecosystem, convinc exist GoPro camera owner to upgrade, and sell new accessori to the holdout who alreadi have a GoPro they'r happi with.Do so with less took on new mean last night when the companyannounc an addit 270 posit will be eliminatedto reduc oper expense.Act Camera Market Satur and DJI' Drone DominanceOutsid of it own missteps, two factor are commonli cite for GPRO' misery. Ani GoPro turnaround is larg conting on whether the compani can overcom these factors.Th first is the consum drone market. Drone sale continu to grow at a rapid pace, despit their steep cost. In January,NPD Group releas a reportcal for U.S. sale dollar of drone to increas 177% from 2016 to 2018, with the bulk of those dollar be spent on hobbi drones. That would be good news for GPRO - it Karma drone is in that lucr hobbi drone zone - except the compani ha to convinc consumersnotto buyDJI. That' a tall order, consid that the Chines drone giant domin the industri to the point thatTh Vergesaysit biggest competitor is itself.When GoPro announc the fold Karma drone, DJI show off it' own Mavic Pro fold drone within days, undercut GPRO' price andbeat the Karma drone to store shelves. Gain a meaning foothold in the drone market is doable, but it' go to be an uphil battle.Th second problem is with it core product, the action camera.Last year, GoPro Hero sale tanked. Thi wa blame larg on a satur market for action camera with water resist smartphones, such asAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhon 7. Astudi from Tracticasuggest there is some hope - it predict sale of wearabl action camera will see healthi growth from the 7.4 million unit sold in 2015 to 24 million by 2021.Even if that is the case, however, a GoPro recoveri in the action cam market is conting on up it game. A recent comprehens test show the flagshipGoPro Hero 5 ha one of the lowest qualiti resultsamong action camera popular with drone owners. The Hero 5 score a 36 overal score in testing, just two point abov the bottom place and far behind the 65 score by DJI' Zenmus X4 camera.Mak the situat worse, new premium competitor likeNikon Corp (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NINOY) are introduc their own action cameras. So GoPro ha room to grow it action camera sales, but the competit it face will be tougher than ever and current outclass it flagship model.Turnaround in GPRO Stock: Ye or No?Despit the challeng it' face over the past year, there is the potenti for the compani to stage someth of a comeback in 2017.The organiz chang are painful, but will pay off with lower oper expens and should provid more focu to help prevent issu that should have been caught, like the Karma drone flaw. New flagship Hero camera should boost sales, assum the compani can avoid the product delay that affect the Hero 5 while improv quality. A renew focu on accessori will help to spur sale among it exist client base, even if they don't buy a new camera thi year. And 2017 will be the first year that GPRO goe into a holiday sale season with the Karma drone available.Oracl Corpor (ORCL) Stock: The Cloud Is Right, But the Price Is NotEven after today' 14.5% bump, at $8.42 (compar to histor high in the $90 range) GoPro stock doesn't reflect much in the way of investor confidence.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait,3/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) ha taken a bit of a breather thi month after a terrif run. Appl stock gain 30% just between Novemb and earli March, and is up over 50% from late June levels.makeArticleAd();Th latter run, incredibly, ha ad about $250 billion to the market valu of AAPL stock.Part of the gain have come from the fact that AAPL wa just too cheap, particularli below $100 thi summer. But optim toward the iPhon 8 ha boost hope that Appl stock can jump-start growth. (The issu at key competitorSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), includ theGalaxi Note 7 debacle, like have help as well.)So the question now for AAPL is when the iPhon 8 is come - and how much upsid might be left from a success launch and product cycle.For now, it look like there' still some gain left for Appl stock … but investor might need to have some patience.Wil the iPhon 8 Move Appl Stock?At the moment, it appear the iPhon 8 will be launch thi fall, accord to variou reports. But Appl ha said littl about the launch, leav a guess game for observ and investors. Even the name isn't clear: The next phone seem like to be call the iPhon 8, not the 7S, but that' not assur at the moment.Most observ are expect an iPhon 8, rather than a 7S, becaus the next-gen product will have major changes. The most notabl wa thought to be a curv OLE screen, but those report have been question of late. Iri recognition, facial scanning, and a larger screen (on a phone of similar dimensions) are all expect to be featur of variou version of the phone.7 Dividend Stock With Yield That Grow Like WeedsWhat might be most interest for Appl stock is the price. On Monday morning, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said supplier price support a possibl $1,000 price for the new iPhone. Other report of a high-end""Edition""hav specul an ASP over $1,200. Higher price for iPhon mean higher margin for Appl - and like a higher multipl for AAPL stock.Wil Investor Buy the Leak and Sell the News?Th biggest worri ahead of the launch is if there will be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" reaction from investors.It is clear that some of the optim over the past few months, in particular, ha been driven by consum reaction to the leak spec for the new iPhone. Indeed, Appl stock tradit ha been movedalmost sole by iPhon sentiment. Sale of other product have been pretti much flat the last four years.So if there is a larg base of investor bid up the Appl stock price ahead of the iPhon 8, the question then becomes: What might happen in Septemb when the product actual is released?Th higher expect get now, the greater the chanc of a disappoint later. Everi aspect of the new product will be dissect - and ani rumor spec (like, say, the $1,000 price tag) that aren't in the iPhon 8 will be consid a ""miss"" by Apple.What' Left for the iPhon 8?With Appl stock back near an all-tim high, that possibl would concern me over the next few months. For investor with a longer-term focus, however, there' still reason to see upsid in AAPL off the iPhon 8 launch.Again, AAPL stock gener ha match up well with iPhon product cycles, and that should keep the stock move upward if the launch and subsequ sale are a success.Th Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Ha Big ImplicationsMeanwhile, a big hit with the new iPhon could onc again separ Appl from Samsung. It would also differenti iO fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android ecosystem more broadly. That in turn might allow AAPL stock to onc again receiv a growth multiple, instead of the low-double-digit-plu cash earn multipl at which it current trades.In either direction, the iPhon 8 will matter, becaus the iPhon still is the major profit engin for Apple. Roughli 63% of fiscal 2016 sale came from the iPhon - and given margins, possibl a higher portion of profits. Appl need a winner in the iPhon 8 to drive Appl stock higher. And while earli specul look like the iPhon 8 will be a hit, the recent run in AAPL stock may have price in at least some of that success.Investor hope for more like will need to wait for Septemb - and hope Appl ha onc again deliv on it promise.Th author ha no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlaceHow GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Make a ComebackDo the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacl Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Interest Rate are Rise -- Is Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

"The Best ‘Trump Trade’ Right Now is Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL)",3/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsRockwel Collins, Inc.(COL) might not be as popular asBo Co(BA) orLockhe Martin Corporation(LMT), but the company' root can be trace back to WWII and the vener P-51 Mustang.makeArticleAd();In the '60s, it produc the Apollo spacecraft that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. By the late '70s, it wa commiss to spearhead NASA' Space Shuttl program, start with ""Challenger,"" and eventu build four other orbit that made hundr of trip into outer space.Th GP system use by so mani of our electronic, automot and aviat product might not even exist without Rockwell-Collins. It ""Navstar"" GP satellit were among the first commiss by the Pentagon.Bi mani measures, it ha produc some of the most impress and influenti aerospac and commun technolog of the 20th century.And even after sever merger and acquisitions, and an eventu spinoff in 2001, Rockwell-Collin is still an aviation, defens and technolog forc to be reckon with.But thi is more than just a compani with an impress lineage. It is the ""best-in-breed"" for it sector, heavili integr into aerospace, defense, infrastructur and even rail. Growth in these sector equal earn growth for COL.Given Presid Trump' effect on consum and defens stocks, and hi expect $54 billion increas in defens spend alone, I'd expect Rockwell-Collin to be highli valu like mani of it peer and trade at new all-tim highs, but share still have a littl way to go befor hit either benchmark.And even though Rockwell' share have ralli sinc Trump' election, there' still a disconnect between it valuat and that of it peers.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Thi disconnect is like becaus Rockwel sell direct to compani like Boe and Lockheed, instead of directli to the government. So when investor are research top defens contractors, Rockwell' name isn't the most readili apparent. As more the popular trade get crowded, the inform will trickl downTo get an idea of value, Rockwell' forward price-to-earn (P/E) multipl of 17.24 is 43% lower than it industri averag (Bloomberg). It ratio is also lower than both Boeing' and Lockhe Martin's, even though it incom stream are quit diverse.Oddly, the opposit tend to be the case when you look at other similar supplier-versus-end seller exampl such asAppl Inc.(AAPL) and it suppli chain companies.Analog Devices, Inc.(ADI), which suppli chip for Apple' iPhone, trade at a forward valuat nearli 50% higher than Apple's. Mani of Apple' other supplier also trade at a premium valuat as well.And just as the iPhon would fail to oper without it components, mani of the product made by Boeing, Lockheed, and other would fail without Rockwell.Conserv Outlook From Company, Analyst Up TargetsEven though Rockwel recent beat analysts' consensu estim for earn in the fourth quarter, manag temper the outlook for the come year.Th conserv outlook both on the earn call and in the company' annual report keep the expect low and allow the company' stock to appreci at a less volatil rate.Analyst still have been up their price targets, with a hand target price of $100 and higher.Rockwell' all-tim high of $99 wa made back in May 2015.

Spoiler alert: Probabl not.iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Declin iPad salesDeclin iPad sale are put pressur on Apple' tablet segment. Apple' iPad sale in the company' most recent quarter, or it first fiscal quarter of 2017, were down quit sharpli from the year-ago quarter. iPad unit fell 19%, and iPad revenu fell 22%.Apple' need for new tablet to help revit the segment isn't anyth new. iPad sale have been declin for years. For instance, Apple' iPad unit sale and revenu dure the entir trailing-12-month period were down about 14% and 11%, respectively. Go further, iPad unit sale have been declin on a trailing-12-month basi sinc the second quarter of 2014.So investor shouldn't expect possibl new iPad to suddenli revers thi trend. But thi doesn't mean investor shouldn't hope for some solid updat to the lineup.

When we look at the number of peopl buy iPad for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether thing are reach penetr point or not, the number indic that it' not close to that kind of thing. The custom sat number are through the roof. Literally, the custom sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It' stunning. ... But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm veri bullish on iPad.Cook could be right. iPad could still have some room to run.

Sinc that time, it ha trade as low as $3.70 and as high as $3.96. The stock close at $3.83 on March 3, 2017.On Februari 13, JP Morgan downgrad the stock to Underweight from Neutral.

On a year over year basi Januari 2017 saw an increas of 16.8% and Februari saw an increas of 41.6%.Let me write that one down again. On a year over year basis, Februari sale were an increas of 41.6%.

Volum spike to more than 4M shares, but it seem that expect might have alreadi been run high for the stock. The first week of Februari sat the stock trade comfort over $4 but ha yet to get back over that level sinc Feb 9.I dug into the report and found some inform realli hasn't been wide discussed.ASP' and Big ScreensTh first chart that I want to show you is ASP' per squar meter. Now normal I don't see ASP' (averag sale price) measur per squar meter, so I am hope that someth is ""lost in translation"" (mayb thi scene captur my lack of understandinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXGXZiX0pCA).Th next slide that I want to share speak to the screen sizes. Thi is the number that will be key in the upcom earn release. When the top two segment expand we know we have found a winner. The bigger the screen, the higher the price and almost alway the higher the margin.xxA Quick ComparisonI know that AUO isn't just in the OLE field, but it strike me as odd that the market is richli reward one stock in that space and anoth is realli be left out. To me, that mean there is some big opportun to find out if there is some real justif for the lower multipl or if AUO just isn't readi for prime time.In term of the number that the Zack Research System (ZRS) give me, I see AUO trade at 15x trail and 3x forward earnings. Compar that to OLE which hover at 81x trail and 57x forward and you start to think see the potenti here. Price to book ha AUO at 0.6x while OLE is at 7.4x. Price to sale ha OLE at a stun 19.6X while AUO is 0.4x.Those are drastic differ set of numbers. Keep in mind that AUO ha post some great sale number alreadi in 2017 while the consensu is call for OLE to see sale growth of about 22%.Just take a look at thi year to date perform chart of OLE and AUO. AUO ha move up 7% thi year accord to Googl Finance, but OLE ha rocket higher by more than 50%.

The compani expect to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also abov the $0.65 consensu estimate.In late after hour trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estim Like Move HigherWhen a compani rais guidanc over the consensu you can expect the analyst to adjust their models. These model help them deriv their earn estim which are use in the Zack Rank. Sinc there haven't been ani earn revis over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). In the come day I anticip the stock to see sever upward revis which should help boost the Zack Rank for thi stock to a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisit and they were touch on dure the confer call. Dure the call, manag talk about how the ObjectVideo acquisit will allow custom to track car and licens plate or even custom in a store.Th Icontrol Network deal close in the quarter and the compani mention how the Piper unit power a portion of the ADT platform. The industri had been view as ""we versu ADT"" but that ha chang with the advent of custom home protect servic offer by cabl companies.An analyst question if the compani wa look to a product offer around cars, and while the compani would not commit on a specif answer, it wa clear that it could be someth come down the road. Mani time dure the call manag note that they were maintain a healthi level of spend for R&D. Have an expand platform is key becaus the secur busi ha been chang veri rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookA we think about the chang in home security, it is clear that peopl are ad devic and servic thank to the rel eas of the internet. Manag note on the call that peopl want these product and servic to come from one source.A an example, I have a Googl Cam (formerli Dropcam) and while it is access via it own app I would like to see it be usabl via my Amazon echo. Ye the Googl Nest is control via the voic recogn tool, but I would like more functionality. I often search on Amazon for devic that are compat with Alexa sinc I have power out that is control by anoth company. It too ha it own app and with onli a few devic have multipl app is alreadi a pressur point for me.With the strong revenu guidance, manag believ that it product and servic will be well receiv by customers.Analyst Note ComingA I look at where most recommend are, I see a few potenti upgrad tomorrow. Goldman Sach start coverag of the stock with a Neutral rate on Januari 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm ask about the potenti for organ growth from Icontrol which allow manag to talk about how they were go to hold their cost structur constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translat to better than 20% margin. It is possibl that Goldman Sach up the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.Raymond Jame downgrad the stock back on August 16 as the move their rate to Market Perform from Outperform. Imperi Capit ha the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.Roth Capit start coverag on Octob 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target. Don't be surpris to see that price target move to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initi with a buy rate and $37 price target on Decemb 1. They are clearli the most bullish on the stock and for good reason. I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recent post results.Trad Range?Th stock ha a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surpris to see a new level reach tomorrow. Whi do I say this? Well back on Octob 31, 2016 some unusu call buy wa spot in ALRM. The call wa a $35 strike with a March expiration. At the time, the stock wa $29 and chang so it wa a pretti big reach. I see those same call close at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anyth to get too excit about.What did catch my eye on the option chain wa all the put that move the day of earnings. The 27.5 strike that expir on Friday saw 729 contract vs open interest of 898. Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium seller as the put wa pay $0.42.I like the chanc of sever price target increas come tomorrow. There is an outsid chanc we get an upgrad on the stock as well. Throw in the idea that some mildli aggress call were bought sever month ago I and I like the chanc of thi stock trade over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter.

Appl step up it game in India by doubl it advertis outlay, while also attract top talent -- employe benefit expens rose 25%.The impress growth come despit IDC' estim that featur phone sale grew by around 10% in India last year, even as smartphon growth slow down to just 8%.On the other hand, the Middl East and Africa (MEA) region is show greater affin for iPhones. Apple' shipment in thi regionshot up 133%in the third quarter of 2015, give it 3.9% of the market, accord to the last avail data from Counterpoint Research.Th latest data for 2016 is not avail yet, but IDC estim that iPhon sale will grow in the MEA countri thi year -- thank to the anniversary-edit iPhon -- despit the rage popular of featur phone there. While IDC also estim that shipment of featur phone shot up by almost 32% in Africa in the second quarter of 2016, thi doesn't seem to be have a neg impact on Apple.What' drive Appl in emerg markets?Apple' iPhon sale are strong in emerg market -- despit the avail of cheap phone and problem that are often relat to develop economi -- thank to improv spend power and infrastructur development.In India, for example, almost 79% of the popul had access to electr in 2012, up from less than 51% in 1990. African countri are also make great progress toward electrification, as the Republ of Congo' electr access ha grown to more than 41% from less than 25% over the same time period.Even Zimbabwe, one of the weakest economi in sub-Saharan Africa, ha seen similar growth in electrification. The challeng of charg a smartphon will diminish in such market in the long run as step are taken to provid electr to more residents, lead to 79% smartphon penetr in 2020 from just 52% in 2012.Improv spend power is anoth driver behind Apple' growth in emerg markets. For instance, consum spend in India ha shot up 23% in the past three years, and could grow anoth 18% in the next three years.A it turn out, India will be the second-largest smartphon market thi year, with shipment top 200 million unit by 2020. Thi is great news for Apple, as the project rise in consum spend could help iPhon sales. What' more, Indian custom can buy iPhon with interest-fre equal monthli instal that make them more more access for Indian consumers.On the other hand, Deloitt forecast that Africa' annual GDP (gross domest product) will grow by over a third in 2020 from 2015 levels. Thi could push iPhon sale there as young consum in sub-Saharan Africa are quit image-conscious, spend over 50% of their incom on person care.Th Foolish takeawayFeatur phone are not go to hurt Appl in emerg markets: Becaus consum will eventu enjoy greater spend power and a better qualiti of life, they will not stick with featur phone forever, lead to higher smartphon sales.Apple, on it part, is tri to increas access to it phone in these fast-grow area by set up manufactur oper and lower costs, which should boost iPhon sale in the long run.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The iPad Is Peaking,3/15/2017,"And I'm not talk about unit sales. That happen year ago, specif Q4 2013;Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) sold 26 million tablet that quarter, and unit sale have trend lower ever since.Rather, it seem like Appl may be run out ofproduct ideasfor the iPad. Not onli ha Appl start to elong iPad product cycles, which now seem to be occur everi two year or so instead of everi year, but the new featur and updat that the iPad get are increasingli incremental. Thi ha been true of iPhon and smartphon more broadli for quit some time, but at least in the case of the iPhon the devic continu to sell inrecord numbers.Consid the current round of rumor regard the iPad(s) that Appl is expect to unveil as earli as next week, accord toMacRumors.makeArticleAd();iPad Pro and Appl Pencil. Imag source: Apple.Rumor ha itThre new iPad model are reportedli imminent: a 9.7-inch model, a 10- to 10.5-inch model, and a 12.9-inch model. The smaller and larger version of the trio are differenti enough in form factor, but it' hard to imagin consum complain that their 9.7-inch iPad would be so much more use if onli the diagon measur wa 0.8 inch larger.A far as spec go, the newest model should receiv an A10X chip, which should be a more power version of the A10 Fusion that power the iPhon 7 and 7 Plus. Beyond the expect cadenc of spec bumps, there don't appear to be ani major new featur or function in store. There' also almost no way that Appl is readi to transit iPad to OLE displays, which are expect to appear (finally) thi year in the most expens iPhone. That' especi true sinc display are alway the largest cost driver, OLE display are quit expensive, and the iPad is much larger than the iPhone.I Appl focus on the wrong market segment?Judg by the steadi declin in iPad averag sell price (ASPs) over the year follow the introduct of the cheaper iPad Mini lineup, it should be clear that the smaller form factor is reson more with consum than the larger and more expens models.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarter shown.Yet the iPad Mini still get lower prioriti than the larger iPads. Instead, Appl is focus on move upmarket with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that is intend to cater to the enterprise. In order for Apple' enterpris strategi to work, it need to realli make the iPad Pro competit as a laptop replacement. Thi is a pitch that Appl ha onli recent begun making, histor posit the iPad as athirdcategori of devic that consum should buy, while rival have been pursu 2-in-1 form factor for much longer.Appl make it clear that it doe not target the sub-$200 tablet market. That' all fine and in line with Apple' premium brand positioning, but it could still tackl the $200-plu tablet market by simpli alloc more development resourc to the iPad Mini. On one hand, it make financi sens that Appl continu to priorit the iPhon as it largest revenu driver. On the other hand, the iPad arguabl need more attent so that iPad unit sale can perform better.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

George Soros’ 'The Way Ahead' Lecture,3/15/2017,"With my TV broken for the last sever month and a useless repairman back by a compani go out of business, I have had a lot of time to devot to learn and thinking. Recently, I realiz I need to dig into fundament and decidedGeorg Soro wa the best place to start. Thankfully, there are plenti of hi speech and lectur online.Soros' ""The Way Ahead"" lectur seri from 2010 is veri interesting. It cover histheori of reflex and how it appli to financi markets. The lectur contain some interest idea that have yet to happen, but seem to appli to the near future. You can watch the lectur below.makeArticleAd();To follow are my quick note and thought on the materi presented.Back in 2010, Soro felt the financi crisi wa not the end. He expect anoth crisi within a year or two. Obvious that did not happen, but he explain he did not see the recoveri from 2009. I am not say a crisi is around the corner, but we should never lose sight that one could be.Th billionair investor said that eventually, the U.S. will not domin the world as it ha in the past. If Soro is right, a new paradigm will emerge. There will like be mani potenti opportun to profit dure the shift. As a 13th gener American, I am sadden by the short-sighted of our leaders, but a new world order is not the end. Rather, it is an opportunity.Soro goe on to discuss the concept ofcentr and peripheri currenc flow .After talk about global financi regul need a forc with teeth, Soro mention how the system is current construct to give rise to ""financi protectionism"" that could disrupt the global markets.Soro discuss mani point in the last few minut of the lecture. The overrid theme is: what happen after the dollar rise and put develop countri in a bind? The world doe not seem to trust American leadership anymor and that could spell troubl forU.S. debt and dollar dominance. My intent is not to say that the follow will absolut happen, but rather togam scenario to see where thing may land. Ultimately, how do we profit from these event should they happen? I will tri to encapsul as mani point as possible:If the dollar continu to advanc higher, will the other power (includ China) want to oper under the Bretton Wood arrangement? Soros' suggest the world should move to an SDR basket as a reserv currency. But could thi realist happen? I doubt the current administr would be will to sit down with the Chines and allow a new world order where the dollar ceas to be the reserv currency. After all, the dollar' reserv currenc statu provid certain advantag to the U.S. govern (e.g. greater debt spend becaus foreign govern are will to buy in).Would it be inChina' best interest to join an SDR-like arrang ? With all the poverti still rack their country, I doubt they would want to give up their manufactur advantag by becom the reserv currency. Mayb they think they can do better than the American and prevent the hollow of their rust belt. But of course, I should mention America can still produc a lot. I see it everyday. However, I also happen to know by deal directli with the Chines that they are skeptic of autom (plant autom is my profession).Soro conced that if Obama fail to prevent a double-dip, the popul could becomesuscept to popul . We did not have anoth dip in asset prices, but the folk in the place that vote for Trump did not see it that way. Shortli befor the election, I interview an engin who work for the steel industri in western Pennsylvania. He told me he wa look for a job becaus a lot of plant had shut down and he knew he wa next. Thi is a common stori that illustr the peopl who vote for Trump did not care about stock prices.At the end of the lecture, Soro mention China will need a more open societi if it want to be consid a develop country. Thi point make me wonder whether a crisi will serv to open China up or make it more isolated. Thi is someth we will have to wait to see.Thes are just my own thought on the lecture. I would love to hear your as well. Pleas feel free to respond in the comment section below.(Th follow review is straight from Oper James, a member of theMacro Op Hub .

"Tech Roundup: GOOGL, MSFT, QCOM, HPE and More",3/15/2017,"Alphabet'sGOOGLCloud Next announc were huge, but didn't dwarf the other big news involv MicrosoftMSFTus QualcommQCOMchip in it servers, or Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEbuy NimbleNMBLor the CIA' alleg hacking.Her are the top stori from last week:Googl Cloud NextAt it Cloud Next confer in California last week, Googl demonstr that it final ha a big growth engin that isn't driven by the search servic it is identifi with. The cloud strategi ha been unfold over the past few year for both Microsoft and Google. But the compani have taken differ approach base on their exist strength and weaknesses. In Google' case, it intent becam clear when it hire VMware founder Diann Green roughli 16 month ago.Green ha clearli work to form, bring in asteadi flow of big clientsinclud Walt Disney, Home Depot, Appl and Snap. At the conference, Googl announc HSBC, eBayEBAY, Colgat Palmol and Verizon indic the grow confid in it platform.Googl also announc a bigcollabor with SAPthat will bring it enterpris applic to the Googl Cloud Platform (GCP). Thi will benefit custom in mani ways, give them access to real-tim insight base on big data and offload more complex task to GCP when constrain for memory. Within a coupl of months, SAP will make it own cloud run on GCP and soon start offer G Suit product includ Gmail and Googl Calendar to it own custom base of more than 345,000 companies, includ most of the world' top 2,000 firms.Ther were also some newenterprise-focus Googl Drive toolsinclud Team Drive (allow administr to create, add and delet team member and assign permiss to them within a share space that will retain share file even when member change); Googl Vault for Drive (that store data on Googl Drive for compani to export, search, hold and retain as required); Drive File Stream (alreadi avail for earli adopters, thi allow you to work directli with file on Drive use applic like Microsoft Word and Adob Photoshop, which updat the chang automat to Drive for access from ani of your devic later); and Quick Access with Team Drive (that use artifici intellig base on an analysi of activity, interact between colleagues, and workday pattern to serv the most relev Googl Drive file at ani given time.And that' not all: Hangout also got an enterpris version calledHangout Chatthat could help with corpor communications.A far as acquisit are concerned, the compani announc a couple: AppBridge, which ha a tool of the same name to facilit migrat of data (along with file permissions) from other storag solut whether it' on-premis devices, cloud services, or hybrid solut to Googl Drive. The second wa Kaggle, which host data and facilit machin learn contests.Wintel Weaken Further as Microsoft Demonstr Qualcomm SoCAt the Open Comput Project (OCP) confer last week, Microsoft wa final abl to demonstr a Window server use the Qualcomm Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-compat server-grad 10nm system-on-chip. Centriq also work with accelerators, multi-host NICs, and storag technolog for workload optimization. The product is part of Project Olympus, Microsoft' next-gener hyperscal cloud hardwar design. To demonstr it commit to the project and open sourc in general, Qualcomm also join Facebook'sFBOCP Foundat as a gold member.For the time being, Microsoft say it will use the server internally, but it' not a big stretch to see thi as a trial run for broader deploy to serv it cloud customers. Microsoft is also work with Cavium' ThunderX2 64-bit ARMv8 server chipset and AMD Napl server processor in order to identifi the best fit and the best valu proposit in differ situations. A suitabl second-sourc to IntelINTCmay lower cost for players, especi in an open sourc environment.Cost reduct is the most import consider at the moment becaus of the huge amount of data that must be made avail for machin learn applic and better web ad targeting. That data is in addit to the amount gener from corpor workload continu to shift to the cloud.If ARM design are to make inroad into the server market, the best place to start is not the enterpris (where comput power is a bigger requirement) but the cloud where less complex oper are requir to be carri out at a faster pace. And that' exactli whi ARM-bas chip from a rang of supplier have been fight for a toe hold.Intel hasn't yet been displac as the performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar leader, which give it tremend leverag to hang on to it nearli 100% market share. It can be said with reason certainti that displac Intel entir won't be easi becaus most of the relat softwar is written for it x86 design and few compani have their own softwar stack make the shift to ARM design cost prohibitive.Key Comments-Microsoft Azure' Leendert van Doorn:""W found that [ARM servers] provid the most valu for our cloud services, specif our intern cloud applic such as search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machin learning. These workload all benefit from high-throughput computing,"" and ""But thi is for intern use only, and that is an import bit, becaus we see an opportun for these class of devic for our own datacent use, but we don't realli see much traction on the enterpris side. We have no plan at thi point to produc an enterpris version of Window Server on ARM.""Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice presid of Qualcomm Data Centers: ""We'r not interest in fell the giant in one fell swoop… We'r go to be chip away.""Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insight & Strategy:""Qualcomm' recent announc Centriq 2400 is bill as the world' first 10nm server processor-bas on an instruct set from ARM Holdings. While Intel' Xeon processor are base on a 14nm architecture, we do not yet know Centriq' die size, power, price or perform , so there' no way to empir compar yet. Also, I am not in the camp of 10nm is alway better than 14nm as Intel' 14nm is superior to other with high performance, high-leakag designs. I am look forward to more Centriq details.""Intel statement:""W oper in a highli competit market and take all competitor seriously,"" and ""We are confid that Xeon processor will continu to deliv the highest perform and lowest total cost of ownership for our cloud customers. However, we understand the desir of our custom to evalu other product offerings."" New chip consolid technolog from it Altera and Nervana acquisit are in the works.HP Buy NimbleHP is fatten up, but in a nice way.Aft split away from the client and printer business, CEO Meg Whitman went on to spin out and merg the enterpris servic busi with Comput Scienc Corp, follow that up with the spin off and merger of it softwar busi with U.K.-bas Micro Focu International. At one time, Michael Dell indirectli comment on the slim strategy, say it wasn't the best way to pursu growth.And now it' appar that that' not the onli thing on Whitman' mind. After snap up Silicon Graphics, SimpliVity, Cloud Cruiser and Niara, the compani ha now gone for one of the hottest tech startup call Nimbl Storage.HP will be pay $1.09 billion in a deal expect to close next month. It will also assum or pay off $200 million in unvest equiti awards.Nimbl broaden HPE' all-flash portfolio for enterpris custom by fill the gap between it 3PAR (StoreServ) high-end array and entry-level MSA storage. It also bring on board the industry-lead predict analyt and manag tool InfoSight. Plus, there' Nimble' Cloud Volum that allow data storag in the public cloud near Amazon AW and Microsoft Azur data centers, facilit data portabl between AW and Azur and cloud-bas computation.No wonder Whitman says, ""Nimbl Storage' portfolio… will help us deliv on our vision of make Hybrid IT simpl for our customers.""To further sweeten things, Nimbl ha said that it current ha more than 10K customers.It' easi to see whi Nimbl would sell out: the compani wa grow revenu strongly, but wa far from profit (30% revenu growth for a 41 cent loss in the last quarter). It also got an offer it couldn't refuse. HPE' global distribut strength, strong brand, and enterpris relationship are thing that can help it scale.Moreover, Nimbl is develop it own hyper converg offer and that is a segment where the realli big player are fight for share. By team up with HPE, it may be abl to fund the signific invest requir (CEO Suresh Vasudevan says: ""We believ that join forc with HPE enabl us to further acceler the pace of innov that ha been a hallmark of our valu proposit to customers"").HP on the other hand is in an increasingli competit market with Dell-EMC, Pure Storage, Kaminario, IBM and NetApp. Cisco is anoth competitor in the hyper converg space. Nimbl doesn't just increas it product breadth and increas it analyt capabl but also bring it greater flexibl to decid it hyper converg strategy. Onli time will tell if the hefti price tag it' pay for Nimbl will be worth it.CIA Hack Affect Big Tech CompaniesAppleAAPL, Google, Samsung, Sony, HTC, Microsoft and Facebook user were appar affect by massiv hack oper of the CIA and other intellig agencies, accord to WikiLeaks, which report the matter in 7,818 web page and 943 attachments. The hack relat to the CIA' Center for Cyber Intellig between 2013 and 2016. The NSA and the UK' GCHQ are also involved. CIA spokesman Heather Fritz Horniak ha said, ""We do not comment on the authent or content of purport intellig documents,"" which mean that the alleg haven't been confirm or proved.But the detail of the report and the promis of more revel in the futur indic that there is suffici reason for concern.Th content is that the CIA discovered, bought or otherwis obtain and exploit secur flaw in Android and iO devic without point them out to Apple/Google. As a result, it is thought that some flaw weren't pick up by their intern team for patching, thu leav them vulner to exploitation. Even encrypt messag on WhatsApp were pick up by the CIA befor they could be encrypted. And even Smart TV were exploit use a techniqu that indic the set wa off when it wa actual on and listen to the convers in the room.Appl is the onli compani to have come out and claim that iO 10 user weren't affect although it couldn't confirm a similar situat with older versions.

For longer-term investors, you can consid thi a chanc to buy discount merchandis - to be pick up at a later date.makeArticleAd();Let me explain.Invest firm RBC Capit came out Wednesday morn with abullish note and price target revisionfor Appl stock.

After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and Fitbit wasn't one of them! That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on Feb. 24, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Welcom toIndustri Focus, the podcast that dive into a differ sector of the stock market everi day. It' Friday, Feb. 24, and we'r talk tech and Fitbit' latest earn release. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join on Skype byFool.comsenior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how' it going?Evan Niu:Good! I'm readi for the weekend. It' been a long week.Lewis:Yeah. I think everyon could use a littl break. It seem like Fitbit could definit use a littl bit of a break after releas quarterli number that were, frankly, pretti rough for them.Niu:Yeah. I don't think there were ani big surprises. Even though it wa a pretti bad quarter, the market didn't react much becaus they issu preliminari guidanc at the end of Januari that warn everyon how bad it would be, and it wa pretti much right in line with expectations.Lewis:Yeah. The company' top line came in at $574 million, which is down 19% year over year. That wa well within the revis guidanc they offer of $572 [million] to $580 million. But that revis guidanc wa walk back from origin expect of $725 [million] to $750 million. So, it wa a big adjust that took place in the market. If you look back to late Januari or earli February, that' where we saw the high teens, near 20%, sell off in the stock. There wa no immedi reaction despit the disappoint results. If you'r look for some of the other big number from the quarter, gross margin wa one of the big surprises. That came in at 22.4%. Usually, we tend to see that up somewher in the high 40% range.Niu:Right. That' a function of a bunch of these one-tim charg that they took. Again, they warn about that stuff. They had a big writedown for tool equipment. They also had to increas return reserv becaus channel inventory. They had to increas warranti reserves. All three of those item are ad to cost to get sold. Then, on the flip side, they also had a bunch of price promot becaus they had to start discount stuff to get stuff moving. And that item come as a reduct of revenue. So, you have all these charges, one of them push down revenu and the other three push up cost to get sold. So, it realli pinch their margins. And, like you mentioned, it came in at about 22% on a GAAP basis. Typic they'r around 49%. In fact, if you back out all these items, they would have had about 49%, which is pretti compar to what they normal have. Sinc one of these item affect revenue, it also affect your averag sell price calculation. They came in at around $85. It would have been $95 without these charges. Which, again, is pretti compar to what they normal have. But the fact is that these charg were mostli becaus they realli overestim demand, they realli fill their channels, and these devic were not selling.Lewis:Yeah. I think it wa easi to get caught up in high expect look at the growth trajectori that thi compani wa on. In 2015, thi compani post 150% year over year revenu growth. So, for them to even slow down somewher into the doubl digits, you would think it' fairli reasonable. Look at the full-year result here, revenu came in at $2.17 billion, which wa up from $1.86 billion in 2015. But that' onli a 16% hike. You'r see a lot of the effect of them overestim demand. We can get into why. But, it certainli weigh on financi results, particularli in the holiday quarter, which is typic when we see a lot of these consum devic compani do a ton of their business.Niu:Yeah, exactly. They were veri up front, they own it. They admit that they were realli caught off guard by how weak demand was, and they over-forecast it, and they were a littl too ambiti with their own expectations, internally. They fell short of their own expectations. They had to own it.Lewis:Yeah. I think one of the thing I do realli appreci is they signal thi to the market ahead of results. Issu preliminari results, particularli for a realli import quarter like the calendar Q4, it wa great to give peopl a heads-up of what to expect. There wasn't as much of a shock to the system when they issu their result later on in the month. I think someth else, and I think the ultim caus of a lot of thi stuff, thi quot from manag in the commentary, ""The satur of the Innov and earli adopt segment of the market wa basic the cause."" That' what they'r see as the revis growth rate and realli what push result down for them.Niu:Yeah. There' certainli a nich group of realli activ fit user where that' just part of their lifestyle. And that' a good market for them. But they need to break into the mainstream. Everyon want to get healthier, and most people, even after they make that decision, they kind of let it go. How mani time have you said you were go to start go to the gym, or whatever, and then two month later you give up? It' a common thing. Think about the New Year' spike in gym memberships. Everi New Year, peopl are like, ""Mi New Year' resolut is that I'm go to get healthy,"" and then by Februari they give up. So it' certainli a characterist of the market that it' hard to keep peopl engag in term of their health, but that' thi company' whole point. So, it' an uphil battl in some ways, just by natur of the way that peopl are.Lewis:And one of the benefit that we get from look at their full-year result is they disclos user base inform when they do the full-year reporting. I think they just disclos they have roughli 23 million activ users, and 50 million regist devices. Do you want to touch on how that trend compar to previou years?Niu:Yeah. They give thi number everi year. I like to look at what proport is activ of their total regist base. Right now, like you mentioned, if we have 23 million activ user and about 50 million regist devices, that' under half of the devic that are be active, it' like 45%. Over the past three years, thi number is usual around 60%. 2013 through 2015, it' about 60% plu or minu a coupl percentag points. That' a pretti big drop in term of engagement. Fitbit ha said befor that they don't want you to look at that ratio as the engag proxy, becaus they argu that some peopl go inact but then they reactiv and becom activ again, and it tend to be bumpi so don't look too deepli at it. But at the same time, I still think there' valu in look at thi metric as a proxi for engagement, even if it' mayb not perfect. I think there are still import thing to note. I wa look through the number a bit more carefully, too. One thing they mention that stood out to me wa 26% of activ in 2016 came from repeat customers. Of those, 20% were reactivated. If we go back to that 26% of activations, last year, there were a total of about 21 million activ devices, if you just look at how mani more devic were regist throughout the year. If they'r say that 26% of that is from repeat customers, then the other three-quart is new customers. That' about 5.5 million repeats, almost 16 million new customers. Yet total activ user -- which includ repeat and new -- onli increas by around 6.3 million. So, you have all these new custom come in, almost 16 million who bought a new Fitbit last year. But your total activ user onli increas by 6 million. So, there' a big disconnect there with how mani peopl are buy them and how mani are still use them at year end. And I think that' a pretti troubl disconnect, a big discrepancy.Lewis:And I think those number realli speak to the idea of, there is a dedic group of consum that, the Fitbit product meet their need veri well. These are peopl who want metric on their workouts, their heart rate, the number of step to take a day. And their product are perfect for that. That seem to be more of a nich group than a larg address market as, perhaps, origin predicted. When you see that that' the group which is realli drive a lot of those engag numbers, you have to think that, mayb the ceil is a littl bit lower than we thought for what the total address market is here, and really, the long-term growth prospect on the consum side of the busi for them.Niu:Yeah. I total agree. I think we'v talk about thi with other compani before. It depend on what your growth expect are. You can build a great busi around thi nich group of peopl that' realli active, and you can count on them to start subscrib to the servic that Fitbit want to start selling, like Fitstar. You can count on them to upgrad more regularly. But there' a lot of peopl that are fickl about their health, who are like, ""Oh, I'm go to tri thi Fitbit out,"" and mayb they give up on it. And yeah, Fitbit get that sale, and mayb they'll keep tri to appeal to that customer. But if they just temper down their expectations, there are a lot of peopl who are go to tri and are just not go to stick with it. If you just bake that into your expectations, and adjust your busi strategi accordingly, versu tri to spend all thi money to keep tri to win back all these custom if they'r resist to actual commit to improv their health with these devices, then there' not realli a whole lot you can do. It' a tough dynam to overcome.Lewis:Well, I think that wrap the looking-backward part of our conversation, Evan. I think we'r go to talk a littl bit about what growth might look for them down the road, how they might be abl to reignit it with both the consum segment and some other options. But befor we get into that discuss and see what might be go on in 2017 for Fitbit, I just want to give Fool a littl head up. If you'r interest in incom investing, we have a brand-new servic calledMotley Fool Total Income. It incorporatesdividend stocks, options, bonds, real estat and more. If you want to check it out, all the detail are attotalincomeradio.fool.com.So, Evan, in addit to some of the growth strategi thi compani talk about in their earn release, they also offer up guidanc for 2017. It look like we'll be see revenu somewher in the neighborhood of $1.5 [million] to $1.7 billion, and gross margin return to what we would reason expect, somewher between 42% to 44%. That top-lin number is a 20% dip from what they post in 2016.Niu:Yeah, it' get harder befor it' get easier. Last year, they put up about $2.2 billion, almost. And they'r alreadi predict anoth decline, a declin is definit not a good sign in term of investor sentiment.Lewis:And I think, when you look at some of the strategi that they'r outlin here for the turnaround plan, mayb it' not all that surprising. CEO Jame Park talk about some of the differ thing they'r go to be pursuing, and one of them wa increas their promot activity. Thi is someth that we saw a littl bit in Q4, and I think we'r go to continu to see into 2017 with some of their exist products. They talk about the idea of have more in-stor promotions, work with retail partners. And really, the aim of all of that is to clear out the inventori channel. Of course, when they do that, that' someth that' go to push down averag sell price on devices.Niu:Yeah. They realli overload their channel dure the quarter. They'r get these writedowns, they have reserves, they have to start give discount to their channel partners. Like you mentioned, it is go to take a coupl quarter to clear it out and get channel inventori back in line with a balance. But, it doesn't look too good right now.Lewis:On of the other thing that they'r talk about do is improv effici across the company. We'v seen thi a littl bit alreadi with some reorgan within the business. They'v made some staf cuts. But one of the other thing they talk about wa restructur their accessori business. They move to thi partner and licens model instead of the design and produc accessori in-hous approach. That obvious give them a littl bit less control, but it might help them out on the cost side, a littl bit.Niu:Yeah. It' just outsourc it, more or less. I think that' probabl the right move, becaus they obvious have better thing to focu on right now. And yeah, come back to thi idea, they just bet too heavili on growth. You mention headcount, their headcount increas by 60% last year. That' whi they realli need to cut back those oper expenses, and that' also whi they laid off about 107 people. But, at the same time, they also did a bunch of acqui-hires. They acquir Pebbl and Vector within the past coupl of months, and that certainli add to your headcount, also. But those are much more strateg in nature, becaus those will help the develop of the smartwatch, which they'v been talk about. But yeah, they just need to cut down these cost to realli get back in line with more reason expectations.Lewis:Yeah, and you talk about that be a focus decision, too. I think realli not have to worri about that stuff allow them to focu on two core things. One of them is, the product that they are offering, and mayb build out some more all-in-on smartwatch-lik products, and the other one be other way for peopl to be use their product that are beyond the base consum approach that most peopl are commonli use them for now. So, we talk about thi a littl bit in the first half of the show, but they'v mention that they have captur thi innov group already, peopl that are earli adopt and want fresh gadget and fresh technology, and the affin group of peopl who want fit trackers. They'v talk about the idea of need to transit to that mid-to-l adopt market, and then meet them with product that are go to be attract to them. Jame Park had thi quot in the confer call where he said, ""Increas the valu proposit of our softwar beyond just track is key to bring more custom to the Fitbit famili and reignit growth."" I don't know about you, Evan, but to me, that sound like it' go into smartwatches.Niu:I think it' both. There' a coupl thing go on here, I think. They do want to get more into thi premium subscript servic game, which is whi they bought Fitstar in 2016. It' one of those mani mobil app where you subscrib and it give you workouts, and all these other things. I don't think it' realli taken off. They relaunch it, and the recept is pretti good so far, but we'r not realli see a lot of revenu or number come from it. But, I think they'r make progress on that front. And then, the other piec of it is the smartwatch idea. They'v been realli cogniz of the overlap of basic wearabl tracker and more full featur smartwatches. And they have a coupl product that are watches, but they don't even consid them smartwatches, they consid them, like, a GP watch, for example. And that wa a big part of whi they bought Pebbl and Vector. But Pebbl specif ha a platform that offer third-parti apps. It' one of those kind of platform that' on top of a platform, so if you have an iO or Android device, you use to go and download the Pebbl app. Insid the Pebbl app is an app store. It wa never veri big, there wasn't a whole lot of stuff in there, but the point is, they had one. So Fitbit want to use that as a foundat to build their own third-parti platform. It' unclear if they'r go to tri and do it on their own, or if they'r go to tri and take the same approach of a platform on top of the platform. But either way, that' definit a big part of their strategy. They want to expand into creat a third-parti ecosystem, which is realli when, gener speaking, you see a lot of innov on top of platforms, is when you realli open up to other developers. They want to get into services, they want to get into software, and realli creat thi smartwatch platform. So, those will be the realli big, import thing go forward. And also, that would help them diversifi a littl bit away from hardware, becaus right now, the whole busi is built on hardwar sales. With consum electron product companies, it' a realli fickl market, it' realli hard to reli on recur revenu when you'r a hardware-bas company.Lewis:Yeah, it can be a littl bit tougher to anticip what consum upgrad cycl might look like devic to devic and how long they'll hold on to them. Additionally, work in softwar and servic offer Fitbit a total differ margin profile. We talk about how they had to do some heavi discount in order to clear through some inventory, and that' someth we'r go to continu to see in 2017. That whole product segment won't be subject to the same wild swing and margins, if they'r abl to build it out to be a meaning part of the business.Niu:Right. And definitely, it' scale much better. If they could realli get Fitstar off the ground...but that' a realli competit market. There are so mani app out there nowaday that are realli gear toward fitness, and they'r subscription-based. There' alreadi a lot out there. Fitbit is enter a pretti crowd market. I guess the challeng will be, how do they differenti themselv in that market? And certainly, they have some advantag becaus they integr with the devic itself, and they have their other platform that track your biometr data and all these other things. But it'll be tough. I think it'll be pretti import to see if they can pull it off.Lewis:Yeah. Outsid of that consum realm, one of the other thing we got some color on in the manag commentari follow result wa the push into some of the health tech initi that we saw some of in 2016, and I think the compani is go to continu to push. As an exampl of where thi come into play for the company, last year, they announc a partnership withMedtronic, and basically, that partnership sync up Medtronic' continu glucos monitor with Fitbit' activ tracker as thi integr solution. The idea wa that it help individu with type 2 diabetes, to help with their manag of that, and give a better diagnost on gener activity, and might have improv outcom as well. For context, there are ten of million of individu with type 2 diabet in the U.S. alone. That is a veri larg market. Obviously, these are some veri earli partnerships. They also have some stuff go on in the insur space withUnitedHealth. But, in my mind, that is realli where some of the big growth opportun might be for them. And they spent a decent amount of time highlight that on the confer call.Niu:Yeah, I think that' definit anoth area of opportun for them. If you can integr with these other exist health providers, you can realli differenti to a greater degree, and realli build up your presence. At the same time, there are these corpor well initiatives, which, again, is also veri competitive, too, becaus you have much larger compani likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) that have also been work activ to work with corpor well programs. Appl ha a deal withAetna, and Fitbit ha a deal with UnitedHealth. Both compani are tri to get into thi corpor well stuff, becaus compani see that as a way to reduc their healthcar cost over time. So, I think there' definit an opportun for both, and that' probabl grow enough to where both can succeed without necessarili be a zero-something. The pie is grow so big that there' probabl enough to go around, consid how young the wearabl market is. I think corpor well is really, as an industry, is onli now start to realli embrac some of the technolog that' be offer out there. I think we'r still in the earli inning of that.Lewis:Yeah. And insur are ultim look for as much data as possibl when it come to the popul of peopl that they'r provid coverag for. I'm sure that' an appeal option to a lot of those insurers. That' all to say, with the healthcar applic and with what they might be do on the consum devic side and some improv in their product line, it seem like there are still some opportun for Fitbit. Thi is a beaten-up stock. I know there are a lot of Fool that own it and realli like the busi and have been follow it for a while. Look at guidance, the compani is trade at 1X 2017 sale at thi point. We can't do a P/E valuation, we have to do a price-to-sal becaus the earn have turn negative, and will, over 2017. But that' a pretti darn cheap business.Niu:Yeah. That' the thing. I don't think Fitbit ha thi great busi go on. I think they have a pretti solid business, but I don't think it' someth where I'm like, ""Woah, that look awesome."" I'm pretti neutral overall, I would say, and specif becaus it' so cheap, it' hard for me to be bearish, given how cheap the stock is right now. Given the current valuation, the expect are pretti low. You don't have to realli execut that well to meet low expectation. If the stock were higher, like it wa a year ago, I would probabl be a littl bit more bearish. But I'm not bullish, either, becaus they have a lot of uncertainty, they obvious just had a realli terribl quarter, and it' not clear if they'r go to realli be abl to pull off some of these big strategi they'r tri to pull off to grow. And they have opportun that we'v talk about. But, yeah, I'm kind of neutral, becaus they'r realli cheap, but I don't see a whole lot of upside. There' not even a lot of upsid in their own guidance, as you can see. So it' not like they have thi huge runway ahead of them, necessarily. But, I'm kind of in the middle.Lewis:In the past, I'v liken them toGarmin, the GP company, in that earli on with Garmin, that seem like a transform technology, and it was, and the growth wa huge in the first coupl years. And then thing level off, partial becaus the GP technolog got integr into smartphones, but they wound up serv a realli hyper-focus nich of peopl that need perform navig devices, peopl that want realli high-perform smartwatches, peopl that want navig for more extrem weather and sail and stuff like that. It' a busi that ha a core group, and that core group isn't necessarili go anywhere. That is kind of what I see with Fitbit right now, with the caveat that they do have a larg opportun in the health tech space. I think that Fitbit, as it continu to be -- as it look right now, if it continu to be thi company, I don't love the growth prospects. If they'r abl to make that pivot over to the digit health world and becom more of a softwar servic and gener platform compani that ha these health partnerships, then it becom realli interesting. They need to do quit a bit to make that move, though. On my end, I'm not realli look at them until I see some solid evid that that transit is take root.Niu:Yeah, I think it' go to be realli tough to transit to smartwatches. Appl is go to be a huge presenc in smartwatch specifically. It' go to be so hard for Fitbit to compet against them. We were talk about thi befor the show. Fitbit' total market cap is, like, $1.5 billion. Appl make 5X that in a singl quarter. So, in term of resources, you just can't compete. And Appl certainli start off with smartwatch without do anyth like the basic stuff. Now, Fitbit made it name with basic wearabl and basic trackers, and now they'r tri to move up-market to challeng Appl in the smartwatch market. Not that the smartwatch market is do veri well right now. It kind of stumbl last year. But conceptually, it' go to be realli tough to compet with Apple.Lewis:Yeah. So, ultimately, thi might be a busi that wind up servic it core user base for an extend period of time, and do a veri good job at that. There are growth opportunities, but they have to be quit a bit to realli make them materialize, and make them into larg ramp for thi business.Niu:Right, and they have so mani differ area that they have to execut on to realli pull thi off. The question is, can manag actual focu on each of these areas? It' a lot to juggle.Lewis:Yeah. We will look to futur earn result and see.

For starters, the compani is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Appl could go on a transform M&A spree - even with the repatri tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potenti for a tax repatri holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple' in even better shape.Additionally, Appl is a cash cow that continu to bring in billion of dollar each quarter, which should help continu to fund dividend and stock buybacks. Plus, it cash hoard should continu to grow over time.Despit ralli more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trade with a below-market valuation. Sport a price-to-earn ratio of around 16, it' hard to consid Appl overvalued.And the valuat argument is important. Too mani investor tri to justifi a higher Appl stock price by appli a market-averag multiple. That' an inaccur measurement, as Appl tend to trade between a P/E rang of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rare will it trade in-lin with the averageS&P 500stock.With that said, have a low valuat is part of what make Appl stock attractive. Share go through pretti extrem up and downs.

While we just highlight it P/E ratio as a positive, itisclos to the top of it five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compar to the averag stock, but get expens compar to it histor average.Additionally, Appl stock ha gone on a massiv rally.

Instead, their respect product are innovative, utilitarian and just downright cool. Wall Street thought the same thing and pump the price of Fitbit stock aggressively.Unfortunately, that wa nearli two year ago. Among tech circles, that' about a decade.

Thi is the recommend cours of action for GoPro, and by deduction, FIT stock. The core complaint about both compani - copycat competitor - will eventu devalu the firm as mere commodit assets.

But among the rattl consum tech stocks, I give FIT stock a solid chanc of success recovering.Primarily, the reason to own Fitbit product is self-evid - we eat too damn much! We'r stuck in the cubicl smash away at spreadsheet and word processors. We don't engag with our fellow human be unless it is through a digit platform. Quit frankly, we don't get much sunlight. Our nation is ""The Walk Dead,"" but we don't realiz it.Whi Ford Motor Compani (F) Stock Is Still a Scream Good BuyI also fundament disagre that Fitbit stock is a commodit investment, and that it' face a shrink market. Look at the produc price index for sport andathlet goods. In two years, it ha jump 8%. So even though we have an obes problem, the PPI demonstr that American do care about their health.

However, our health and fit club make up 19% of totalfit centersworldwide. Additionally, we have 55 million member who are sign up at a gym, which is 36% of the global gym member population.When analyst propos the argument that FIT is commoditized, they'r say that the compani can be undon by low-pric leaders. That may be true initially, but what about the long run? Becaus the avail data suggest the opposit story. More peopl are will to spend their discretionari item specif for health and well reasons.

Now I'll dive into what I think the risk of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMi biggest concern with GOOGL stock ha alway been that it is effect a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digit advertis billboard in the world, with about 88% of it revenu come from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock' growth ha been driven by thi spectacular seizur of internet territori from competitors.In fact, dure the financi crisis, ad revenu still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despit a worldwid ad revenuedeclineof 11% that year.GOOGL Stock and Digit AdvertisingNow, digit advertis wa still in it hyper-growth phase back then. Should anoth major crisi hit, I'm not so sure that Alphabet won't see a decline. Yet what' so astonish about GOOGL stock is just how much money it make from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% declin in total revenues, which would bring it roughli in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still gener net incom of $15 billion or so, and oper cash flow of $26 billion or so.Thi is hardli a catastrophe, which show that for now at least, GOOGL ha a lock on substanti growth in ad revenue. However, that advertis is the result of peopl use Google' search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Googl ha more than 80% search engin marketshare. It' so popular that we now use the product' name as a verb.7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackI think it will be veri difficult to supplant Googl as far as search engin usag goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less relianc on the search engin and, therefore, fewer eyebal for ads. Mobil app have obvious explod in number and usage. The more adept and fulli function that app become, the less Googl may be used.Soci media is onli go to grow, and the more that these product offer in term of either their own search engines, or place for advertis to divid their ad spend, the wors it is for GOOGL.There' also some interest competit in the form of product searches, and of course, that competit come fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Accord to a 2016 PowerReviewssurvey, 38% of user use Amazon as a place to search for products, and Googl come in second at 35%. I think about my own usag when it come to product searched, and yes, I alway start with Amazon. Inventory, price and review are the reason whi peopl start there. The larger that Amazon grows, the stickier it will becom as far as product searches, and that could mean fewer eyebal for GOOGL.Obviously, Alphabet Inc. ha plenti of money and can ramp up competit in mobil access, butAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) obvious have a corner on that market so far.What Nvidia Need to Avoid a Breakdown (NVDA)Ther is some regulatori risk, as well. The EU slam Alphabet Inc. for tweak search result to direct peopl to it own shop sites. The FCC is an unknown beast - it could end up regul the internet in way harm to GOOGL stock.However, when it come to buy the stock, I don't see immedi danger to GOOGL that make it valuat less attractive. At 18x next year' earnings, and five-year annual analyst project of 19.3% growth, it' alreadi undervalued. When I give it a 10% premium for global brand name, cash flow and cash on hand, it becom a true growth and valu play.

Intel' revenu today come primarili from sale of personal-comput processors, processor for enterpris and cloud servers, and network applications.Qualcomm, on the other hand, make most of it profit from licens wireless technolog and patents, and gener most of it revenu by sell chip that go into smartphon and, to a lesser extent, other mobil devic like tablets.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();For years, it ha been wide known that Qualcomm wa work on processor design to attack Intel' data-cent dominance; first commerci shipment are expect to begin in the second half of 2017. And for years, Intel ha been go on about tri to attack Qualcomm' wireless-chip busi -- achiev it first real success last year when it captur cellular-modem share from Qualcomm inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7-seri smartphones.In other words, these two chip giant are on a collis course. Let' look at what each side could lose, what each side stand to gain, and what thi come battl might mean for investor in either company.Intel deal it major -- but potenti onli -- blowIn the past, Intel had told investor that it expect to compet broadli across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the compani said it wa develop a whole stack of chips, design to span everyth from low-end smartphon to what the compani refer to as ""hero devices.""In addit to those chips, Intel had been pursu stand-alon cellular-modem effort for quit some time, though with littl success until recently.Investor might be awar that Intel cancel it pipelin of mobile-processor product and substanti reduc it invest level there. (Intel said at it most recent investor meet that from 2015 to 2017, it spend in mobil will go down about 55%.)So, Intel is, by and large, neutral as a threat to Qualcomm' mobile-processor business.However, the compani won a larg portion of the cellular-modem spot insid Apple' iPhon 7 seri of smartphones, which led to a reason bump in revenu for Intel and a correspond decrement to Qualcomm' revenues.Qualcomm sharpen it knivesThough Intel' mobil effort ultim translat into Qualcomm lose some busi at Apple, Qualcomm' ambit are much more significant.Qualcomm announc that it will be work with softwar giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to bring person comput run Window 10 on Qualcomm' Snapdragon 835 processor to market dure the second half of 2017 -- directli attack Intel' largest business.To make matter wors for Intel (and perhap sweeten the deal for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seem commit to develop data-cent processor for now. Signific share gain on Qualcomm' part (and correspond share loss on Intel' part) -- should they occur -- aren't like to happen overnight.However, Qualcomm' upcom Centriq 2400 chip havealreadi gotten Microsoft' blessingfor it intern use, which lend credibl to the notion that major data-cent custom may be will -- and, frankly, eager -- to work with altern supplier rather than Intel.Th upsid and downsid for each companyFor Intel, the onli upsid I see in thi contest is it potenti to gain some addit cellular-modem share from Qualcomm at Apple. The opportun like isn't that big from the standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenu would like come at a much lower margin than Intel' corpor average. Right now, Intel' abil to hurt Qualcomm in it core wireless-chip busi seem limited.Th upsid for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seem greater. It can take share from Intel in the latter company' core busi of personal-comput chips, as well as it data-cent business, start from essenti zero share.Intel certainli ha signific resourc with which to defend itself, so it' probabl not prudent for investor in either compani to model in substanti market-shar shift to Qualcomm anytim soon. But, in term of which compani ha more to gain and which ha more to lose: The answer come up Qualcomm and Intel, respectively.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own,3/14/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBi most accounts, the futur look bright forAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Citi recent up it price target on Appl stock in anticip of a massiv wave of upgrad from iPhon owner who have age models, and the company' plan to doubl it high-margin servic revenu over the cours of the come four year doesn't seem un-doable.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAft all, AAPL ha been beef up it app and digit content busi at a rather brisk pace for some time now.And yet, to observ not look at the compani through rose-color glasses, there' potenti troubl ahead. Here' a closer look at three headwind that could slow AAPL share down more than most trader might expect.Thre Troubl Realiti for Appl StockLast week, analyst with Citi rais their price target on Appl stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintain the research outfit' ""Buy"" rating), think a wide swath of the 715 million iPhon owner out there right now are on the verg of final upgrad their device, as31% of those owner haven't upgrad in a coupl of years.It' not bad logic; we know the company' best new custom are it old ones.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowMeanwhile, though it wa littl more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook ha put plenti of emphasi on sale of servic and digit content. He' onli scratch the surface, however. After gener roughli $25 billion in revenu in 2016, Appl is aim for $50 billion in servic revenu by $50 billion. That' still onli a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenu Appl muster in 2016, but digit sale now make up the company' second-biggest segment; the iPhon is still the biggest.Befor we pop the cork on the champagn bottl though, there are three red flag everyon would be wise to process.1. The iPhon 8 (probably) cost too muchWhil the launch of the iPhon 7 in the fall of last year could be consid a success in that the compani sold arecord-break 78.2 million unit in the previou quarter, given thehyp surround the device, the compani should have blown away sale figur for it iPhon 6.Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materi for the 7 wa ultim displac to the iPhon 8, which is suppos to be unveil in Septemb of thi year. The word is that the admittedli impress devic is go togo for a cool $1000 each. At that price, even the most loyal of Appl fan could balk.2. The popular smartphon is preemptiv cannib itselfAsid from sticker shock, would-b owner of the upcom iPhon 8 may keep their wallet close for the same reason mani potenti buyer of the iPhon 7 didn't pull the trigger - they'r wait for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.To that end, what' current be refer to as the iPhon 9 alreadi promis (in rumors) to be an amaz piec of hardware,complet with a fold screen. That may postpon purchas of the iPhon 8 later thi year, though 2018' iPhon 9 could see softer demand becaus whisper of the iPhon 10 rumor will be circul by then.It' a viciou cycle, with Appl arguabl unabl to ever realli log a blowout iPhon launch.Fitbit Ha BlackBerri Syndrom (FIT)3. The Googl Pixel is really, realli impressiveFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiari Googl was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analyst estim the companyonli sold about 2.5 million of the device.Bear in mind, however, thi is Google' first direct foray into the smartphon world, and could be consid littl more than a dri run.Th Pixel 2 is slate to debut sometim thi year, and it' a good bet the compani ha made a point of learn a lot with it first outing.Bottom Line for AAPL StockInvariably, some (or several) owner of Appl stock interpret these concern as a call that the compani is doomed, and then proceed to ""color disagree."" So, let me clarifi someth that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock' worst day it' still essenti unstopp to other smartphon players. Don't read too much into the worries.On the flipside, in that Appl stock is all too often found on investors' pedest - lift there by assumpt that the compani is infal - it' never a bad idea to recogn all plausibl risks. These three risk could each end up stir up surpris headwinds, and noth take a toll on a stock like an unexpect disappointment.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You Back7 Futur Blue-Chip Stock You Need to BuyTh post3 Reason Appl Inc.

It's Time To Use This Winning Trade Again,3/14/2017,"Earn season is virtual over, and with 99% of the compani in the S&P 500 reporting, result are a littl better than expected. About two-third of compani beat analysts' expectations, in line with the long-term averag rate. Earn per share (EPS) came in about 4.9% higher than they were a year ago, the first time we'v seen year-over-year growth in earn for two consecut quarter in two years.It seem as if the earn outlook should be bullish for the stock market base on the growth in EPS, but mani analyst are warn that the market is overvalued. Such warn are often base on chart like the one below, which show the price-to-earn (P/E) ratio is higher than average.Thi chart look back at the past 10 years. Interestingly, to me, the P/E ratio reach it high in the first quarter of 2010, as the stock market wa bottoming. Bear were argu the market wa overvalu when it wa at the begin of what would prove to be an extend bull market.Y could argu that the recess wa an extraordinari time for the economi and no one could forecast what would happen next. The president, Congress, the Feder Reserv and regul were all do what they could to boost the economy.I would argu those same sentiment appli to 2017. No one know what will happen next on tax policy, regul or even interest rate policy. Washington is in turmoil, and upcom chang could boost earnings, which might make the current P/E ratio of 21.5 look like a bargain.W know there is talk of a tax cut. Corpor rate could fall from 35% to 20% or even lower. These rumor chang are expect to happen by August, and I believ it will be retroact to the begin of the year. A tax cut of that magnitud would rais EP sharply.For now, analyst expect EP of $131.28 for the compani in the S&P 500. To be conservative, we can assum the drastic reduct in tax increas earn by just 8%, an amount equal to about one-third the reduct in rates. Thi would boost earn to $142 a share.A decreas in regulatori cost could also increas company' bottom lines.It' import to rememb these chang don't occur in a vacuum. Real action from Congress should increas consum sentiment, which would be reflect in higher sale and earn for larg companies. In short, the economi could grow much more than expect thi year, and EP could be much higher than expect when the fourth quarter is actual reported.Stock are price in higher earnings, and some analyst believ current level are dangerous, as price could declin if Congress becom deadlocked. I see opportun for now but am watch close for sign of irrat exuber in the market.Whil I am bullish in the long run, I do believ caution is warrant in the short run. Stock have move up quickli sinc the election, and we'v had more than two weeks' worth of consecut record high in the Dow Jone Industri Average. Now is a time for caution, and I want to turn to a trade with a high degre of safety, a short-term put sale in Appl (Nasdaq:AAPL).I'v success sold put on AAPL five time sinc Juli 2016 for annual return of 44.8% 27.4%, 25.7%, 64.3% and even 78.9%.

The answer aren't clear, and thi could be whi Pandora stock seem to be stuck in a rut outsid of the pocket of time when buyout specul start to percolate.Pandora ha a problem with user growth. It had 81.1 million activ listen a year ago, so it audienc base ha stalled. Folk on the platform still spend a lot of time on Pandora, but it could be becaus they can't or won't pay Apple, Spotify, or other tech giant in thi crowd field for on-demand streaming.There' no deni that on-demand stream is hot.

How Apple Inc. Can Keep the Premium iPhone a Step Ahead,3/13/2017,"Later thi year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to launch a premium iPhon in addit to two direct successor to today' iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plus. The differenti featur of the new iPhon are expect to be the use of an OLE display (in contrast to less advanc liquid crystal displays) as well as a newer, more premium-look industri design.However, at some point -- quit possibl with iPhon model that will launch in the fall of 2018 -- the more ""mainstream"" iPhon model will see design makeov and incorpor the newer OLE display technology.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();How, then, after introduc a ""premium"" iPhon in the fall of 2017, can Appl continu to bring out differenti premium iPhon model in the year ahead that will be worthi of a meaning premium to the ""standard"" models.In thi column, I'd like to go over a coupl of way that come to mind.Bett camerasOn of the big sell point of thi year' iPhon 7 Plu wa the addit of a dual camera system. Appl use the dual camera to enabl a 2X optic zoom featur as well as a depth of field featur (Appl market it as ""portrait mode"").Given that Appl report that the iPhon 7 Plu is prove to be the company'sbest ""Plus"" model everin term of mix within the company' iPhon 7-seri shipments, it' probabl reason to assum that potenti custom are will to pay more for interest camera features.Go forward, I could see Appl introduc three tier of camera functionality: a baselin camera tier for the standard iPhone, an upgrad version for the Plu variant, and then a still more feature-rich camera subsystem for the premium iPhone.Indeed, as Appl will obvious want to charg more for said premium iPhone, it should have greater room in it bill of materi to use more expens technolog (imag sensors, lenses, etc.)Bett processorsToday, Appl use the same A-seri chip for it standard iPhon and it Plu iPhon model. The onli iO product that get a fundament better processor is the company' iPad.Go forward, though, it might make sens for Appl to differenti it lineup base on the processor insid -- classic perform segmentation. The standard iPhon model could use the standard A-seri chip (i.e. A11, A12, etc.) while the premium iPhon model could get, say, a ""+"" variant of that chip (i.e. A11+, A12+, etc.)Appl wouldn't need to go crazi in necessarili build an all-new chip just for the premium iPhon (though there might be a compel case for that), but what it could do is be more aggress about pick the veri best A-seri processor that roll off the line and run them at higher speed than what the ""standard"" A-seri chip run at to deliv better performance.A slightli faster chip by itself like isn't go to convinc mani to go with a premium iPhon if they had no intent of do so anyway, but such a market point could tip the scale if a custom is tri to figur out if the better, higher-pr model is realli the way to go.Bett displaysToday, Appl alreadi differenti it iPhon model by display qualiti -- the Plu model use sharper display than their standard counterparts. And, of course, Appl seem to be readi to segment by display technolog even further in the come product cycl (i.e. OLE for the premium model, LCD for the standard models).Appl should continu to do that go forward. Even onc the mainstream iPhon model have gotten their eventu OLE upgrades, Appl can still differenti it premium iPhon with other display enhanc such as curv displays, higher resolut displays, brighter displays, and so on.Foolish takeawayAt the end of the day, Apple' job is this: it need to build increasingli compel product to drive iPhon upgrad (and potenti share gains), and it need to segment it product line more aggress to drive upsel and therefor maxim averag sell prices/profit for a given level of unit shipments.Appl appear well on it way to fulli exploit the potenti that exist here, and I think over the next coupl of year -- begin with the come iPhon cycl -- investor will see an acceler in these effort that may ultim enhanc sharehold value.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rather than impos a fairli simpleexcis taxon alcohol beverages, Japanes beer ha agrad policy. Thi ha prevent mani of the nation' beer stock from truli reach their potential.makeArticleAd();Source:Moyan Brenn via FlickrBreweri in Japan are regul by malt content - the greater the malt, the more tax you pay.If you thought that wa weird, hold on - it get worse! Real Japanes beer is label at the groceri market as such: beer. But for those that want to avoid the oner taxat of standard malt beverages, breweri can produc beer knockoffs, or deris known as ""happoshu."" These beverag integr peas, corn, or soybeans, essenti anyth undesir to drop the malt content.In fact, the ""Big Four"" of Japanes beer stock -Asahi Group Hold Ltd(OTCMKTS:ASBRF),Kirin Hold Co Ltd(ADR)(OTCMKTS:KNBWY),Suntori Beverag & Food Ltd(OTCMKTS:STBFY) andSapporo Hold NPV(OTCMKTS:SOOBF) - have an unwritten polici of flood the market with happoshu. Thi way, they can still sell their alcohol beverag while get underneath the taxat threshold.Japanes Beer Stock Versu the GovernmentTh current iter of Japanes beer law date back to 1953, accord toJapan Inc. Sinc then, two revis were introduc - one in 1962, and one in 1989.

Unfortun for Japanes beer stocks, their brew wa not affected. Decid not to take the dispar lightly, STBFi wa the first among the beer stock tointroduc happoshuin 1994. Shortli thereafter, ASBRF, KNBWi and SOOBF follow suit with their own variant of cheap beer.What wa a creative, but liter distast way, of get around Japan' archaic alcohol law wa a short-liv victory. The suit in Tokyo caught on to the scheme, and began adjust their malt threshold lower. In response, Japanes beer stock becam creativ in their concoctions. The back and forth provid job for research and develop teams, but wa a nightmar for anyon who enjoy a cold one.Inarguably, though, Japan' craft breweri industri absorb the most pain. Becaus craft beer containsexot ingredients, the govern often classifi them as happoshu. That wouldn't be a problem except for one thing - craft beer is expens to make. But sinc they'r label as happoshu, domest powerhous STBFi overwhelm them. After all, whi pay more for cheap beer?For independ Japanes beer companies, the choic are limited. Domestically, the term happoshu ha a neg connotation. Internationally, they would get clobber by the mainstay beer stock ASBRF, KNBWY, and SOOBF.Beer Stock Critic for AbenomicsFortunately, chang is on the horizon. Accord toBloomberg, the ""Financ Ministry, in an effort to boost the competit of Japanes beer in the intern market, will chang the tax rate for beer and the substitut start in 2020, continu through 2026.

Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL),3/13/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world' largest technolog company, and it onc wa one of the best growth stock on the market. It ha shift gears, though, and now Appl stock is one of the more promis dividend growth play on the market.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrAAPL paid it first dividend - at least sinc 1995 - on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investor 38.9 cent per share on a split-adjust basis.Th payout ha been hike four time since, and current sit at 57 cent per share. That' a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017' dividend increas expect to be similar. After all, AAPL stock onli ha a payout ratio of 27% of it trail earn and a 1.6% yield.When you look at sharehold yield - dividend plu buyback - Apple' record is even more impressive. The compani spent $12.2 billion on dividend and a whop $29.2 billion on share repurchas in 2016. That work out to a sharehold yield of 5.6%.AAPL is return capit at a blister pace.10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the BillsHowever, while most sharehold are ecstat with the dividend on Appl stock, allow me to present an altern argument:Appl should cut it payout … and mayb even elimin it altogether.Apple, Meet AlphabetLet' take a minut to compar Appl to one of it peers,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Alphabet' dividend polici is pretti clear. It saidin it 2016 10-K filing, ""We have never declar or paid ani cash dividend on our common or capit stock. We intend to retain ani futur earn and do not expect to pay ani cash dividend in the forese future.""Alphabet can easili afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.Th reason behind thi is simple. Alphabet is aggress invest in the kind of project that can realli boost it top line. It ha been work on a self-driv car sinc 2009. It invest more than$6 billion on Googl Fiber. Alphabet also team up withFidelitytoinvest $1 billion inSpaceX.In total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and develop in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capit expenditures.Appl is still invest in the future, but not as aggress as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and develop and $13.5 billion on capit expenditur in 2016, despit make a net profit of $45.7 billion.In other words, Alphabet reinvest $24.1 billion back into it busi in 2016 while earn $19.5 billion. Appl reinvest $23.5 billion while earn $45.7 billion. AAPL bare reinvest half of it earn back into it business.AAPL Need to Make Some AcquisitionsAppl doe have some excit plans. One of the tech world' worst-kept secret is Apple' plan to somehow be a part of thecar of the future. It ha also been work in thevirtu realiti space, and mani expect big improv toAppl TV. These invest are great. But I don't think they'll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.It' time for Appl to go shopping.Appl could easili take the $41 billion it gave back to sharehold in 2016 and use it to make a huge splash.Say Appl agre to buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) at a 50% premium to today' price - so, roughli $91 billion. AAPL could pay off the deal in just a few year from it exist cash flow alone, and would own a compani that ha doubl revenu in the last three years.Intel Corpor (INTC) Buy Mobiley NV (MBLY) to Win the Auto MarketApple' main growth driver today is servic revenue. In it most recent quarter, AAPL grew it top line 3% on a quarter-over-quart basis.It grew servic revenu by 18%. Acquir Netflix would would not onli supercharg that division, it would give Appl access to Netflix' whole librari of content.Th Bottom Line on Appl StockThere' a reason whi AAPL trade at the same multipl as the rest of the market. Investor assum - right so - that it is a matur compani with no immedi growth prospects. If Appl slash it dividend and announc it wa use that money for acquisitions, investor would sit up and take notice.There' no guarante such sentiment would send Appl stock soar right away. In fact, it'd be easi to see the market take the short-term view that someth is amiss, and sell AAPL as a result.But if execut right, such a strategi would make Appl sharehold richer in the long run.A of thi writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

Here' my take.Curv or not, thi is a big jumpTh OLE iPhone, whether it ha a curv display or not, is like go to be a real improv in form factor and aesthet compar with the current-gener models. The OLE display itself should enabl much improv imag qualiti (if Appl can make thi display HDR-capable, then that'd be an even bigger bonus), and the form factor is said to includ a stainless-steel frame as well as a higher screen-to-bodi ratio than the current iPhon model do.Th display and form factor changes, coupl with what are sure to be solid improv in camera capabilities, intern specifications, and even the rumor 3D sens capabilities, are probabl go to be enough to trigger a so-cal iPhon ""super cycle"" -- at least if such a cyclecanstil occur these days.If Appl can ship the devic with a curv OLE display, that'd be nice, but thi is unlik to make or break the commerci success of the device.Sav curv display for next time?Interestingly, a report from The Bell (via MacRumors) claim that Appl aim to switch over complet to OLED-bas display for it iPhon product line by 2019.I suspect that onc Appl introduc thi rumor premium iPhon in it product stack, it is go to want to continu to have product at that price point in futur gener even as technolog origin introduc at that premium price point trickl down into the more mainstream models.Imag source: Apple.What Appl could do, then, is ""save"" the curv display for the premium iPhon that it introduc next year, while transit it mainstream iPhon product to flat OLE displays. That way, Appl improv the appeal of it product across it product stack while keep the best technolog goodi in the most expens products.An excit product cycl ahead for AppleTh main point is this: Appl appear to have an excit product cycl ahead of it as it introduc the premium OLE iPhon alongsid what are expect to be refresh version of the current iPhon 7/7 Plu designs.What remain an open question, though, is how Appl intend to maintain/grow iPhon demand follow the potenti upcom ""super cycle.""Appl may be abl to further stimul demand by bring flat OLE display to the ""standard"" price point while introduc 3D curv display in the next-gener premium model, but without a signific delta in features/function between the ""premium"" model and the ""standard"" models, Appl might risk see a mix down in it product shipment in the follow cycle.That said, I have some thought on how Appl can counter that -- but that' a topic that I'm save for my next Apple-rel column.

The Next iPhone Could Be a Big Catalyst for These Apple Suppliers,3/13/2017,"Rumor ha itApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) 10th anniversari edit iPhone, expect thi year, is go to be groundbreaking. From it have a glass bodi to sport more memori to have an edge-to-edg OLE display, the rumor around the next iPhon are aplenty. One rumor that seem to have gain some credibl of late is the inclus of wireless charg in Apple' next flagship model.JPMorgananalyst Harlan Sur believ that at least one of Apple' iPhon thi year will sport custom wireless charging. Sur' forecast is in agreement with what other analyst have been saying. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Secur expect that all the iPhon Appl releas thi year will have the wireless-charg feature.Wheth wireless charg will be part of the next iPhon and whether that would boost sale is unknown. But it' not just Appl fan who will be watch develop closely.Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) andDialog Semiconductor(NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) also stand to benefit from wireless charg in iPhones.makeArticleAd();Broadcom can make big money from Apple' wireless chargingSur' research note say that Appl and Broadcom have been work on wireless-charg technolog for a coupl of years. Apple' partnership with Broadcom doe not come as a surprise: The latter compani wa one of the first mover in thi space.Imag source: Broadcom.Around three year back, Broadcom launch a multistandard wireless system-on-a-chip (SoC) -- the BCM59350 wireless-charg power manag unit -- for use in smartphones. Broadcom' product wa compat with all of the wireless-charg standard -- includ the Wireless Power Consortium' -- so that it can be use by differ smartphon OEMs.At that time, Broadcom had said that it wa sampl the power manag unit with ""select customers,"" but there ha been no updat on the chip since. Thi leav open the possibl of Appl enter into an exclus arrang with Broadcom; the smartphon giant ha been known in the past toforc it suppliersinto such deals.Additionally, CNBC report that Appl ha enter the Wireless Power Consortium, which set one of the standard that Broadcom' chip supports. Moreover, Sure also said that the rumor glass case on the back of the upcom iPhon will support wireless charging, sinc it is prone to less interfer than a metal case.Th likelihood of Appl use Broadcom' chip to enabl wireless charg is definit there. If thi turn out to be the case, Sur said, Broadcom' iPhon revenu opportun from wireless charg could be worth $500 million to $600 million. But Broadcom might not be alon in the race for Apple' wireless-charg riches.Thi Appl supplier could also be in the frayDialog Semiconductor reli heavili on Appl for revenue.

Why Apple Should Be Scared of This Company,3/12/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) reign at the top of the smartphon market is under threat. Slowli but steadily, Chines telecom giant Huawei ha been spread it wing across key global markets, in a bid to displac Appl and Samsung from the top of the smartphon heap.makeArticleAd();Huawei' ambit of becom the second-largest smartphon compani in the world receiv a shot in the arm in 2016, as it smartphon sale increas close to 27% from the year before. In stark contrast, both Apple' and Samsung' shipment fell 4.3% over the same period, accord toGartner. The strong growth in shipment gave Huawei 8.9% of the smartphon market in 2016 compar to 7.3% a year ago.Bi comparison, the market share of both Appl and Samsung took a beating. The Cupertino-bas smartphon giant' share of the market fell by 1.5 percentag point to 14.4%, while Samsung' market share fell by two percentag point to 20.5%. Huawei, however, ha manag to consist increas it smartphon shipments, lead to market-shar gains:Data sources: Strategi Analyt and Counterpoint Technolog Market Research. Chart by author.Hav alreadi occupi the third place in the smartphon race, the Chines vendor will now go all out to achiev it lofti ambitions. In Novemb 2016, the chief execut of Huawei' consum busi group told Reuter that it want to becom the second-largest smartphon compani in two years. But will it be abl to meet thi aggress target?China and India will be tailwind for HuaweiTh Chines compani ha been seek growth in it home market. Last year, Huawei ship 76.6 million phone in China and sat in the second place with a market share of 16.4%. Meanwhile, Apple' Chines shipment drop an alarm 23% to 44.9 million units, give it a single-digit market share of just 9.6%.Thi mean that Huawei ha open a huge gap over Appl in China, as it smartphon shipment there are up almost 22% in 2016. China will be the key to Huawei' global smartphon dominance, sinc it is the world' biggest smartphon market and account for 21% of global shipment last year.What' more, the grow adopt of LTE connect in China mean that smartphon demand in the countri will remain strong. GSMA Intellig forecast that China will have 1 billion 4G connect by 2020, compar to 762 million at the end of 2016. The increas adopt of 4G mean that custom will need toupgrad to smartphonesfrom featur phone as they move away from legaci technolog such as 2G and 3G.On the other hand, Huawei is also look to make inroad into the Indian market. Last year, it said that it aim to have 10% of the Indian smartphon market by the end of 2017. In fact, Huawei' Indian consum oper report directli to the Chines headquarters, show the compani recogn the import of thi market.Thi is not surpris as annual smartphon sale in India are expect to top 200 million unit in 2020 (rise from 102 million unit last year), make it the world' second-largest market. If Huawei manag to carv out a 10% share for itself in India, it can add 20 million unit in smartphon sales.Thi look like an uphil task sinc it had just 0.5% of the Indian market in the first half of 2016. But in Septemb 2016, Huawei began it smartphon manufactur oper in India, and it plan to manufactur 3 million unit by the end of 2017. If it is abl to convert all these unit into sale thi year, the company' Indian market share will gain respectability.Bi comparison, Appl is yet to get it manufactur oper in India into full swing. Though it manufactur partner Wistron ha set up a plant in the southern part of the country, it will onli produc around 300,000 to 400,000 unit of the iPhon SE initially. Thi is a far cri from Huawei' manufactur capacity.Th secret behind Huawei' growthHuawei ha a smart formula to win over custom in big smartphon market -- offlin sales. In China, Huawei plan to set up 1,000 store across all counties, apart from strike partnership with distributor and retailers. It also plan to deploy 460 servic store in 45 nations.Meanwhile, Huawei ha partner with more than 50,000 retail outlet in India and is go to set up more than 200 servic centers. The company' offline-stor strategi for emerg market is a smart one, allow it to gain more eyebal and eventu increas sales.In fact, offlin sale in market such as India have been the key to the success of Chines smartphon companies, sinc custom have been abl to touch and feel their phone befor buying. And, just 35% of the Indian popul had access to the internet last year, which could be anoth reason that Huawei ha been busi open retail outlet in smaller cities.A similar scenario is unfold in China, where offlin smartphon sale are gain momentum. The grow shift toward offlin smartphon sale ha encourag Huawei to drastic ramp up it company-own stores.Huawei had bump it global store count by 116% to 35,000 toward the end of May 2016. The compani ha further strengthen it retail presenc as it plan to open anoth 15,000 store in 2016 itself. Around half of it store are on the Chines mainland and across the rest of Asia, with the next-largest fraction in Europe.Bi comparison, Appl ha 491 store spread across the globe, and over half of them are in the U.S. What' more, it store presenc in market such as India and China is neglig compar to Huawei's. Appl reportedli had 40 store in China by the end of June 2016, when Huawei had over 11,000 store on the mainland. On the other hand, Apple' plan to open store in India have been slow by regulations, though it might open up three of them thi year.Huawei' strong retail presenc is complement by the company' strategi of offer both budget and premium smartphones. The Honor 5C, which some review count among the top budget phones, cost less than $170 in India at current exchang rates, place it way below the global-averag smartphon price of $256.In fact, Huawei also sell featur phone in emerg market that cost less than $100. These budget phone help bring custom to it store and improv brand awareness. The compani is now gradual move into the higher segment of the market by launch more mid-rang and premium phones, which should eventu improv the averag sell price of it phones.Imag source: Huawei.Th takeawayA strong retail presenc and an extens product portfolio that cover all segment of the smartphon market have been the catalyst behind Huawei' growth. In fact, the company' two-prong strategi ha put it in the limelight, as the valu of it brand grew 28% in 2016 on the back of high-end devic and market campaigns.Appl and Samsung, therefore, have a fierc competitor that look capabl of break into the top two in the smartphon market.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Andrew Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respect name in the field, perhap put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech recognition, depend on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So mayb it get one word in 20 wrong. That' realli annoy if it get one in 20 wrong and you probabl don't want to use it veri often. That' probabl where speech recognit is today.""Th second hurdl is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remain a strong chanc it will bemisinterpretedwhil undergo natur languag understanding, a process in which the assist attempt to comprehend what we want use the sequenc of word (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctli understood, an assist may still simpli be unabl to solv for the request due to technic constraints. Exampl of both case can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sens of how frustrat the encount can be.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneEncount like these make us feel as though we'r wast our time trust our phone to do what we could have done ourselv with onli a littl more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventu discourag us from even tryingto use our assist for anyth complex, instead reli on them onli for the most trivial of tasks, like set alarm or creat reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdl are solvabl with data, third-parti partnerships, and time, each of which the major player in thi space have been activ accru for years. Return to our example, sinc Siri wa introduc to the world in 2011, virtual assist have grown far more capabl of correctli interpret request thank to advanc in deep learning, a thrive field of AI be util byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and other to improv speech recognition, natur languag understanding, and other compon of voic comput at astound rates. (Click herefor an outstand stori byTh New York Timeson Google' signific role in make thi happen).Equ as important, decis by Appl and it competitor to open their platform up to third-parti servic have made today' voice-bas assist feel far more capabl than in year past. These decis allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride use your Uber account, or order a pizza through your storedDomino'sinform -- not unlik anactualsecretari would do.A the potenti behind voic comput becom increasingli obviou in the come month and years, we should expect more and more third parti to hop on board, eventu expand the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of order an Uber, imagin order a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-parti command avail on Amazon' voice-bas assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technic achiev and partnership will continu compounding, eventu make for a highli practic voic comput experience. Even margin improv in the technolog will convinc user to begin use voic as an interfac more frequently. In the same talk regard the current state of the voic industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as speech recognit accuraci goe from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from bare use it today, to use it all the time."" He added, ""Most peopl underestim the differ between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer.""Although we'r not yet abl to predict when the technolog will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is ani indic -- sinc Ng' speech, Baidu ha built a program capabl of dictat English three time faster, and with 20% less errors, than human be -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguabl far more import hurdl stand in the way. It' a problem share by everi other major comput medium in use today, onli voic is actual solv for it.An instantan comput experienceNo matter the medium, we'v alway interact with comput by issu commands. In the 1950s, we meticul punch those command into card befor feed them into hulk machines. Now, technolog allow us to simpli type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despit these advancements, today' medium still subject user to a uniqu set of delays, a sort of friction that inher slow down the process betweenthinkinga command and actual be abl tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decad ago, that friction most like entail track down a PC with internet, use the mous to open a browser, use the keyboard to run a search, and then sort for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simpli mean reach into our pocket for our phone, scroll with our thumb, and tap away.It' a process so effortless, the averag American now check their phone an estim 46 time per day. It' even becom fashion to argu there' no longerenoughfrict separ societi from our devices; that we'retooplug in to the digit world.So when you consid that voic computing' primari advantag iseliminatingfriction, it becom tempt to dismiss the technolog as a solut to a trivial problem. What that argument critic fail to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simpl convenience, and that ani amount of friction, no matter how small, fundament limit the dynam between a user and their comput medium in two ways.Let' take the smartphon for example.Imag Source: PixabayTh seemingli trivial motion we make when reach for our phone still requir us to be in immedi proxim of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to rememb it' on the counter even befor we can do that. Then, onc we'v reach our phone, we'r requir to physic handl it, a process that gener requir we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limit forc our comput experi to revolv around the locat of our device, as oppos to it revolv around us.They can creat roadblock for those with disabl affect their vision or hand (or really, even those who just have sticki hands, wet hands, or their hand full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immedi comput need.There' a reason speech is our most instinctu form of communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouth and ask. We do that becaus it' instantaneous. Now contrast that with have to locat your phone, have to type in your password, have to navig to an app, have to tap, type, or speak your command. These behavior are not instinctual,but we put up with them becaus the peopl around us usual don't have the answers, and becaus smartphon are our best alternative.But they don't have to be.Th rise of voiceIt' not obviou quit yet, but today' physic bound medium have left a larg hole to fill and voic comput is start to fill it.Ov the past two years, the technolog ha begun manifest itself in the form of always-on, always-listen devic abl to virtual bypass the friction inher in today' major comput mediums. Currently, these devic are best exemplifi by Amazon' line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voic recognit technolog allow user to command Alexa from across multipl room and through variou background nois at ani time simpli by call for it out loud.Imag Source: Amazon.com.Put anoth way, for as littl as $50, Amazon' Echo is give consum their first glimps at a frictionless comput experience. Follow it initi setup, there' no press buttons, no look around for the device, and no navig through screen to issu a command. When it work correctli (like Siri, Alexa is still veri much in it infanc and subject to misinterpret commands) it realli doe allow user to convert their thought to a command in the time it take to form a sentence, captur the essenti promis of voic as a medium.And if the earli estim adopt rate for the devic is ani indic -- Amazon hasn't offici releas sale figures, but as of Januari 2016, Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) estim a stagger 8.2 million Echo have alreadi been sold in the U.S. (a number that pale in comparison to Morgan Stanley' estim of over 11 million), suggest the devic ha achiev well over 5% household penetr -- earli demand for a seamless comput experi is strong, and will like grow stronger as capabl competitor race to introduc their own offer (see Google' Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu' Littl Fish), and as voic recognition, natur languag understanding, and third-parti support continu improv at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figur are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devic will never replac today' exist comput mediums, but will rather augment them. While screen will remain the prefer medium for our more detail and visual comput needs, voic will begin it ascent by take on an increas share of our more ""conversational"" demands, common request we want address with the immediaci we expect from dialogu (""Cancel my doctor' appointment.""

The 3 Best Stocks to Profit From the Rise of China,3/11/2017,"With a massive, grow economi and a balloon middl class, China repres a major opportun for mani American companies. Here' whyWalt Disney(NYSE: DIS) ,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , andChenier Energy(NYSEMKT: LNG) are well-posit to benefit from the continu rise of China.Th world' most belov entertain companyBeth McKenna(Walt Disney):I can't think of a better way to profit from the ever-ris number of Chines citizen join the middl class than to invest inDisney stock. Last June, the legendari entertain giant open it first theme park in mainland China, the massiv $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney, as it aim to captur the balloon dispos dollar of mani Chines consumers.So far, Disney Shanghai' result have surpass the company' expectations. The park had host more than 7 million guest at the time of the company' first-quart earn call on Feb. 8. Disney' manag ha said on the last two quarterli earn call that the park is expect to come veri close to break even in fiscal 2017, which is impress given how new it is and it humong cost to build. This, of course, mean that the park should start contribut to Disney' profit in fiscal 2018.makeArticleAd();Disney Shanghai. Imag source: Disney.Disney ha been delight peopl in the Western world for gener with it icon theme parks, as well as it movies, TV shows, and dizzi array of consum products. So, there' everi reason to believ that the Chines peopl and visitor to China will come to love Disney Shanghai just as much as American and visitor to the Unit State ador Disneyland and Disney World. That, coupl with Disney' unmatch intellectu properti of charact make Disney a great stock to own as China' economi continu to expand in the decad ahead.Troubl and opportunityTim Green(Apple):Appl ha been have all sort of troubl in China lately. Total sale in China drop 12% year over year dure Apple' first quarter despit a rise in global revenue. Thi disappoint result wa actual an improvement: Fourth-quart sale in China tumbl 30% year over year, and third-quart sale crash 33%.Apple' weak perform in China dure the past few quarter doesn't mean the company' growth opportun in the countri are dead. Appl face intens competit in China from local compani as well asSamsung, and it brand doesn't quit have the same power as it ha in the U.S. But an innov product -- perhap a revamp iPhon 8 later thi year -- could revers it fortun and forc it rival to scrambl to keep up.Imag source: Apple.Regain market share in China won't be easy, and it' possibl that competit is just too fierc for the compani to both grow sale and maintain it margin in the country. Flagship phone from Chines compani sell at a fraction of the price Appl charg will be tough to beat. Appl will need to come up with someth truli uniqu to drive sale higher. It certainli ha the resourc to do it.Fil one of China' largest needsTyl Crowe(Chenier Energy):Ther are countless stori about the size and scale of China' thirst for commodities. Ever sinc China switch gear to a more market-driven economy, demand for basic materi and energi ha grown by a stagger amount. Recently, though, we have seen a shift in the type of commod China wants, and those shift trade wind are open up new opportunities, name in liquefi natur ga (LNG).One thing that China ha been work on rather remark in recent year is reduc pollut in it cities. The biggest culprit for air pollut ha been burn coal for power, make steel, and other industri practices. So the countri ha been shift away from coal. In fact, in Januari China announc it wa cancel prior plan to instal 120 gigawatt of coal-fir power plant -- that' equival to 10% of the U.S.' total gener capacity. With incom grow and urban still happen at a rapid rate, China is go to need to fill those energi demands, and LNG is go to be one of the major power sourc to fill that gap.We'r alreadi see thi happen. In 2016, total import of LNG into China increas 32.8% to 26.06 million metric tons, and that is expect to grow to more than 105 million metric ton per year by 2030. There are few compani out there better posit to take advantag of thi come LNG boom than U.S.-bas Chenier Energy. As the U.S.' first LNG exporter, the compani alreadi sent 10% of it 2016 cargo to China, and that wa onli from two of the possibl 11 liquefact train that Chenier ha on the docket to develop over the next half decade.Som might argu that Chenier will struggl to deliv to the Asian market becaus of it locat in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Transport LNG via ship is expens and there are a lot of LNG export termin come onlin in the Pacif Rim. That ha yet to be an issue, as the company' access to cheap domest ga offset these costs. In fact, 28% of it 2016 sale were to the Asia Pacif region, so that higher transport cost hasn't realli becom an issu for the compani yet.China' polici can shift on a dime from time to time, but bet on LNG and Chenier Energi is a smart move as the countri clean up it energi act.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Growth Stocks I'd Buy Right Now,3/11/2017,"The recent bull market ha push mani growth stocks' valuat into the stratosphere. Thankfully, not everi growth stock is price for perfection.Skywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) ,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: REGN) , andUnd Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) all hold promis growth potential, yet are current trade at attract valuations. Here' whi I'd happili buy ani of them today.Imag Source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th smartphon slump is overSkywork Solut is a lead manufactur of radio frequenc chip that help devic connect to the internet. While thi company' stock ha been ralli for sever year now, it put investor on an unpleas roller coaster ride in 2016. Share were slam over concern that demand for smartphon wa slowing. Those fear prove to be well-founded. The compani went on to produc a seri ofearn reportsthat saw it top line head in the wrong direction. That' not someth growth investor want to see, lead mani trader to hit the sell button.Thankfully, the worst of the smartphon slowdown appear to be over. When Skywork report fiscal first-quart result in January, manag predict that revenu in the upcom quarterwould rise by 8%. Better yet, manag credit it upbeat guidanc to an ""expand product pipelin and acceler design win momentum."" That hint that it effort to diversifi it busi away fromAppleandSamsung-- which are two of it biggest custom -- are start to pay off.Look ahead, investor have reason to believ that the top-lin growth is here to stay. Skywork is well posit to benefit from the ""Internet of Things"" trend. In addition, the rollout of 5G wireless technolog also promis to be a massiv tailwind. When ad in the potenti for margin improv and the company' habit of buy back stock, analyst believ that Skyworks' bottom line will grow by nearli 15% annual over the next five years. That' quit a fast growth rate for a compani trade for less than 14 time forward earnings.New drug to the rescueWhil long-term investor in biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceut haveenjoy a phenomen run, the company' recent perform hasn't been all that impressive. Share are down more than 34% from their high in 2015. What gives?Y can blame the downfal on a number of factors. First, the compani report ahandfulofclinicalsetback in 2016 that gave investor pause. Next, the FDA reject sarilumab -- a hope treatment for rheumatoid arthriti -- becaus of manufactur concerns. Finally, the compani is lose a legal battl withAmgenov it new cholesterol-bust drug, Praluent. When ad in slow sale of it top-sel drug, Eylea, it' no wonder share have head in reverse.Despit all of the bummer news, I think there are reason for optimism. First, Regeneron andSanofiar slate to receiv a go/no-go decis from the FDA in the come week about their new eczema drug candidate, Dupixent. Mani believ thi drug hold blockbust potential, so get the green light could help to reignit investors' enthusiasm. Next, sarilumab should be resubmit to the FDA soon now that the manufactur issu are completed. Finally, while Eylea' state-sid growth rate are stalling, the drug is still grow by double-digit overseas.When ad together, Regeneron offer reason to believ that it is still a growth company. Market watcher appear to agree. Current estim call for bottom-lin growth of nearli 19% annual over the next five years. With share trade for 25 time forward earn estimates, I think thi is a growth stock worthi of your capital.Thi growth stori isn't bustedTh last year hasn't been kind to sharehold of Under Armour. The company' stock ha shed more than half of it valu after manag took an ax to profit growth projections. The origin forecast call for $800 million in profit by 2018, but the compani ha sinc abandon that target. When ad in a holiday quarter that featur sale growth of just 12%, it is understand whi some investor fear that thi growth stori is over.Despit the pain, I refus to give up on Under Armour. In fact, I think the huge sell-off is actual a great opportun to get in.Whi am I still bullish? First, whi sale growth wa disappoint in the fourth quarter, there are a hand of factor that explain the slowdown. North American retail store in gener perform poorli dure the holiday season, and 85% of Under Armour' revenu is deriv stateside. That mean the compani isn't immun to the slowdown in retail. In addition, 2016 also featur a number of high-profil bankruptci from retail like Sport' Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sport Chalet, and more. Those headwind should abat in 2017, and a new partnership withKohl'sshould also help to shore up the company' retail presence.Second, while overal result were weak, Under Armour did have a few pocket of strength. Intern sale were especi strong, rise 63% last year. That tell me that thi brand ha oversea appeal, which is most certainli a posit sign.Finally, the company' direct-to-consum strategi also appear to be working. Revenu from thi channel grew 23% last year and compris 40% of total sales. Continu growth here could go a long way toward offset ani futur retail sale weakness.Whil Under Armour' stock doesn't look classic cheap --it never does-- I still think thi compani ha enough growth potenti left to more than justifi an investment.10 stock we like better than Under Armour (A Shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Top Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Now,3/10/2017,"Keep tab on what icon billionair investor Georg Soros, Warren Buffett, and Carl Icahn are do with their money can help you find new money-mak ideas. What have Soros, Buffett, and Icahn been buy lately? Accord to reports,Celgen Corp(NASDAQ: CELG) ,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) , andBristol-My Squibb(NYSE: BMY) are among the stock they'v recent been ad to their portfolios. Sinc these compani have catalyst that could send share higher, it might be time to buy them in your portfolio, too.Soro buy CelgeneGeorg Soro is known for a rapid-fir invest approach, and that mean the stock that get bought by Soro Fund Manag might not stick around too long.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Celgen Corp.Although Soro short-term style mean follow in hi footstep might not be the best way to build a long-term portfolio, there are reason whi you might want to follow hi lead and buy Celgene' shares, and then hold onto them even after Soro sells.Accord to quarterli file with the SEC, Soro Fund Manag bought a small stake in Celgen dure the fourth quarter, and while the posit wa tini rel to Soro money under management, it could still prove to be veri profit-friendly.Celgen is arguabl the best in it industri at develop and commerci billion dollar blockbust drugs. It market top-sel medicin use in multipl myeloma, pancreat cancer, and psoriasis, and in February, it report data that could eventu lead to it have a best-sel in multipl sclerosis, too.Specifically, manag told investor last month that a pivot trial for ozanimod, it oral multipl sclerosi drug,wa a success. Ozanimod reduc MS relaps more than Avonex, an injection-bas therapi that gener $2 billion in annual sales, and importantly, it did so with safeti data strong enough to have me think it will disrupt thi $19 billion per year market.Th oral MS drug that are current avail gener over $8 billion in annual sales, but there are concern over their safety. Tecfidera, the top-sel oral MS drug, ha been associ with a rare brain disease, and Gilenya, the second-best sell oral MS drug, can caus a worrisom drop in heart rate. If ozanimod notch FDA approval, then I think it could win away consider market share from those two drugs.Ozanimod could also be a blockbust becaus of ongo trial that may expand it use into ulcer colit and Crohn' disease.Becaus Celgen think it revenu will surg from about $11 billion thi year to $21 billion in 2020, and it earn per share will more than doubl to at least $13 dure the period, there appear to be no shortag of growth on the horizon. Sinc it boast one of the industry' best balanc sheets, it ha a proven track record of success market new drugs, and it ha ozanimod in the wings, I think there' plenti of reason whi thi Soro buy can be ad to everi day investor portfolios.Warren Buffett take a big bite of AppleWarren Buffett still use a flip phone to make calls, but that didn't stop him from make consum devic giant Appl one of hisbiggest stock holdings.Imag source: Getti Images.Appl show up inBerkshir Hathaway' portfolio earli last year, and sinc then it' becom hi second largest position. Berkshir Hathaway' quarterli 13F report with the SEC show he own 57 million share of Appl in December, but recent Buffett told CNBC that hi Appl stake ha climb to more than 130 million shares.Buffett' interest in Appl could be driven by optim that consum who had previous held off on upgrad their iPhone' are final do so. Last quarter, Appl report that iPhon revenu began to climb again, reach a record. He may also be attract to the company' huge user base, which provid plenti of profit-friendli growth opportun for Apple' services, includ iTunes. Furthermore, he may be drawn to Apple' massiv cash flow. Last year, $27 billion in cash flow help it increas it cash and invest stockpil to a breath-tak $245 billion.Clearly, there' a lot to like about Appl right now. If the compani can keep it foot on the innov pedal, it should maintain the financi flexibl necessari to return increasingli more money to investor via it dividend. At current share prices, the company' dividend yield is 1.6%, but that dividend rate could grow if Appl increas it dividend payout. The compani last increas it dividend by 10% in 2016, so anoth dividend increasecould be in the workssoon.Icahn target Bristol-My SquibbIn February,Th Wall Street Journalreport that icon activist investor Carl Icahn is cozi up to biopharma giant Bristol-My Squibb. Icahn is quiet about hi intentions, but hi track record suggest profit-friendli chang could be come at the drugmaker. In the past, Icahn' use hi sway to shake-up C-suites, win seat on boards, arm-wrestl spin-offs, and convinc compani tosel themselv outright.Who know what hi strategi is for Bristol-My Squibb, but the company' got a lot go on that make it an intrigu target for Icahn (and potentially, you).It best-sel drug is Opdivo, an immunotherapi that make it more difficult for cancer cell to avoid detect by the immun system. Opdivo' won FDA approv in a few cancer indications, but it' wide use in battl advanc lung cancer and melanoma. The drug' abil to combat those cancer ha made it a blockbust seller, with annual sale of $5.2 billion exit the fourth quarter.Whil Opdivo unquestion remain a top-sel medicine, Bristol-My Squibb' share tumbl last year when a trial design to further increas Opdivo' use in lung cancer fell short, and a competitor trial succeeded. The news wa disappointing, but it' arguabl turn Bristol-My Squibb' share into a bargain bin buy.Bristol-My ha dozen of ongo trial that could expand Opdivo' use, includ addit trial in lung cancer that could make last year' failur a moot point. Furthermore, Opdivo isn't it onli fast-grow drug. It also co-market the top-sel anticoagul Eliqui with Pfizer. Last year, Eliqui sale jump 80% to $3.3 billion.Becaus Bristol-My Squibb is forecast sale growth again thi year, but it' lost $30 billion in market cap sinc last fall, it' valuat ha becom much more attractive. It trail 12-month price to earn ratio, for example, ha fallen from abov 30 to about 21. The sell-off in it share ha also result in it dividend yield grow from less than 2% last year to nearli 2.7% now.Admittedly, onli Icahn can tell us what hi plan are to rekindl Bristol-My Squibb' share price, but with big-tim drug alreadi on the market, and a far more reason share price than a year ago, thi stock might be worth invest in.10 stock we like better than Bristol-My SquibbWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Verizon expect to sustain thi trend to continue, which could drive revenu growth back into the red.Bottom Line on Verizon StockTh best part about Verizon stock, though, is that even if none of these growth avenu pan out, the compani will still reward loyal investor with a consist quarterli payout. Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividend in 2016 and current sport a forward annual dividend yield of almost 5% and plenti of cash to keep that chugging.

CELG stock tack on 1.9%, with solid investor particip as the broader market spun it wheel Thursday.What wa behind the bullish move?I suppos some investor may have like what they heard or read as part ofCelgene' presentationat the Cowen Healthcar Broker confer on Wednesday? Or mayb UB wa an influence? The broker initi coverag of CELG on Thursday with a""buy"" rate and $140 price target.Alternatively, is it possibl Celgen investor felt some relief as""ObamaCar Lite""pass through two key Hous committees? If the hardlin ""repeal and replace"" stanc is eventu repackag as ""revised"" legislation, could drug compani with target on their back for egregi price practic also find themselv in a better posit to negoti without too much harm to shareholders? Maybe?What is known with more author is this; investor can buy a best-in-bre in biotech right now. And that meansbuy CELG stock for it growth at a reason price- as well as a breakout that suggest slightli less reason price in the week ahead.CELG Stock Daili ChartBack in November, in front of the presidenti election, there may have been some doubt about CELG stock' prospects. The area highlight in yellow doesn't exactli suggest bull were go to stage a party. Nonetheless, thi strategist wa optimist on share of Celgen and wrote as much in an articl atInvestorPlace.It turn out the technic prognosi on CELG wasn't for naught. A secondari down channel breakout wa quickli follow by a massive-s Donald Trump effect bullish price gap which ha gone on to build a construct ""W""-shape base.In Thursday' session, confirm for the bullish pattern emerg as CELG stock broke abov it handl on heavier and above-averag volume. The next test for share will be a move through the high of the base, but it' expect it won't prove much of a fight.Look forward, given Celgene' larg correct move from 2015 into 2016 and describ healthi base breakout, the former high of $140.72 set back in Juli 2015 and roughli 12% higher is a good initi price target for intermediate-term traders.CELG Stock Bull Call SpreadGiven our bullish outlook for Celgen and after review CELG stock' options, the April $125/$130 bull call spread is thought to be a reason attract play.Pric for $2.15 with CELG trade at $125.02, thi bullish trader need share to ralli by 1.7% to break even at expir in April. Even with the April vertical' shorter-term lifespan, that shouldn't pose a problem for a breakout like Thursday's. And realistically, nor should the requir 4% need to maxim the vertical' profit potenti of $2.85 and return of 133%.An Appl Inc. (AAPL) iPhon Factori in America?

Munger use Berkshir Hathaway' purchas ofExxonMobilstock as an exampl in how Buffett' invest process ha changed:[Y] know whi Warren bought Exxon? As a cash substitute. He would have never done that in the old days. We had a lot of cash and we thought Exxon wa better than cash over the short-term. That' a differ kind of think than the way Warren came up.makeArticleAd();Mung isn't kidding. Thi is veri differ than how Buffett ha tradit invested.Th Exxon tradeIn 2013, Berkshir paid $90.86 per share for it multibillion dollar Exxon stake. In the fourth quarter of 2014, when Berkshir liquid it investment, Exxon share trade for an averag of $93.27 per share, accord to a report byBloomberg. Thus, Buffett purchas and subsequ sold about $4 billion of Exxon stock in a round-trip that earn Berkshir sharehold a single-digit return after dividends. Most importantly, Berkshir wa in and out in less than two years.Thi quick trade is veri uncharacterist of Buffett, who is famou for take the long view. In hi 1996 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote: ""If you aren't will to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about own it for ten minutes.""That advice, it seems, no longer appli to how Berkshir manag it portfolio.Imag source: Getti Images.On of the most import lesson I'v ever learn as an investor is that there are no accid in disclosure, whether the contextu clue appear in SEC file or the document that accompani them. That' whi I find it so interest that Buffett went out of hi way to clarifi how Berkshir view it stock portfolio in hi annual letter to sharehold thi year.Buffett wrote the follow on page 20 of hi annual letter:Sometim the comment of sharehold or media impli that we will own certain stock ""forever."" It is true that we own some stock that I have no intent of sell for as far as the eye can see (and we'r talk 20/20 vision). But we have made nocommitmentthat Berkshir will holdanyof it market secur forever.H added, ""[W]e regard ani market secur as avail for sale, howev unlik such a sale now seems.""With that, Buffett make it clear that it portfolio of public stock is alway for sale, if the price is right, or if Berkshir ha better use for the cash. It' a curiou new detail, one that come just month after Berkshir put more than $16 billion to work purchas share ofAppleand four airlines, industri that Buffett might be will to invest in, but onli if he doesn't have to commit to hold forever.10 stock we like better than Berkshir Hathaway (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It ha alway play up the secur of the iPhon and evenrefus an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneus by a shooter in 2015' San Bernardino terrorist attack.Appl CEO Tim Cook releas a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. govern ha ask us for someth we simpli do not have, and someth we consid too danger to create. They have ask us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""Th WikiLeak Vault 7 releas made it clear that iO wasn't as secur as Appl had thought.How Appl Could Come Out AheadWikiLeak is bad news for Appl in the short term.

Appl quickli went on record as say mani of the vulner identifi in the WikiLeak Vault 7 documentswer alreadi address with iO 10.

As a result,nearli 80% of all iPhon are current run iO 10.Googl also releas new version of Android yearly, but larg reli on smartphon manufactur and wireless carrier to approv and push updates. They have littl incent to do so, sinc lack the latest Android featur could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildli vari assort of smartphones, updat can often be problematic, lead to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajor are run softwar releas in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddress most of the issu in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundr of million of Android devic that could still be affectedbecaus they'r run old software. Most iPhon users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assur that Apple' consist program of releas will address ani outstand issues.Appl ha a similar approach with macOS. It updat it Mac comput oper system regularli and push out secur updat as issu are discovered. With the smart home,Appl take extrem secur measures, includ costli custom chips, factori inspect and end-to-end encrypt between connect devices. Thi approach ha meant slower adopt for it HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of be far more secur than the competition.A for smart TV eavesdrop on you, that' just anoth reason to buy a rel inexpens stream box - like an Appl TV - instead.Th Age of Privaci Is OverMani peopl had been live with a probabl naiv expect that everyth they did with their smartphon wa privat and secure, especi when use encrypt apps. The latest WikiLeak dump should end that notion and leav peopl watch their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc.

Thi is all well and good, but it is realli not suitabl advic for the averag investor.makeArticleAd();Th most famou invest guru got where they are today by be good investors, but that is not to say there wa not a degre of luck involv as well.What would have happen toWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) if hisAmerican Express(AXP) invest had not work out and the Salad Oil scandal had taken down the company?

If either of these scenario unfolded, Buffett would not be where he is today.To give anoth example, what would have happen toCarl Icahn(Trades, Portfolio) if lawmak had view hi action at TWA as crimin and thrown him in jail?Ther are certainli case where thi ha happened, but becaus the rank of the world' most famou investor are stalk by survivorship bias, it is difficult to realiz that for everi one Buffett there are ten of thousand of fail investors.That is whi diversif is so import and critic for long-term invest success.Numb don't lieResearch by Arizona State Univers financ professor Hendrik Bessembind show exactli whi thi is the case. To tri and figur out the averag return of singl stock over the long term, he studi the return of 26,000 equiti over the period of 1926 to 2015. Over thi nine-decad period, equiti creat $31.8 trillion of wealth. The shock thing is that all of thi wealth wa gener by just 4% of equities; 96% of stock achiev nothing. Includ inflation, the real return on 96% of the univers wa actual negative. To put it anoth way, the averag investor ha a one in 24 chanc of pick a stock that will gener posit return over the long term.ExxonMobil(XOM) alon account for 3% of the wealth creat over the period andApple(AAPL) account for about 2%.These find are onli reinforc by a report issu by JPMorgan last year. Accord to the report, titl ""The Agoni & Ecstasy: The Risk And Reward Of A Concentr Stock Position,"" the return on the median stock sinc it incept versu an invest in the Russel 3000 Index is -54%.Furthermore, sinc 1980, 320 compani have been remov from the S&P 500 due to reason of ""distress.""

Even more, while IBM' 44% payout ratio -- the percentag of annual earn it is pay out in dividend -- is well abov Apple' 27% payout ratio, it' still low enough for investor to expect meaning dividend growth for year to come.Indeed, IBM' dividend ha grown at a veri healthi averag annual rate of about 14% dure the past five years.

In 2016, IBM' dividend increas 7.7%, down from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songo transformationha put pressur on net income.Despit the slowdown in IBM' dividend increases, the company' 21 consecut year of dividend increases, along with it low payout ratio, set a solid preced for ongo dividend increas over the long haul.Microsoft: endur cash flow from a profit busi modelMicrosoft' abil to gener headi level of cash flow from it profit busi model is undeniable. For the past 10 years, Microsoft' gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentag of revenue, ha been between about 61% and 81%. Sure, the softwar giant' gross profit margin is on the low end of thi rang today -- at 61%. But the inher profit of Microsoft' software-focus business, combin with the sticki of it Offic suit and it enterpris applic and services, mean it can count on endur cash flow for year to come, to continu feed investor solid dividends.Imag source: Getti Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offer investor a better dividend yield than Apple, but it' still well behind IBM' 3.1% dividend yield.

Recent one-tim charg against earn and restructur charg have suppress net incom and push the company' payout ratio higher. By comparison, Appl and IBM are pay out 23% and 41% of their free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft' most recent annual increas wa 8% -- and the company' financi look set to support similar increas over time.In general, incom investor may not find mani great dividend stock in tech.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 at Its Own Game?,3/9/2017,"The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.Th import stock index consist of 500 of the largest compani that are list on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and secur are weight in the benchmark by market capit levels. Currently, top stock in the benchmark includ Appl (AAPL) at about 3.6% of the total, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.5% of the total, and Exxon Mobil (XOM) at 1.65%.But while thi approach is a great baromet for market health, is it the best way for investor to put their money to work? Investor have numer option in thi department, includ product likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simpli follow the benchmark exactli as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potenti better way?Ent Equal WeightIn thi edit ofth Dutram Report, I look for an altern approach in a talk with Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manag of INDEX Funds. Hi key product, the Index Fund S&P 500 Equal Weight (INDEX), take the same S&P 500 stocks, but invest in them equally.Thi mean that instead of Appl account for nearli 4% of the total, or Microsoft make up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughli 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalanc dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and everi stock come with thi same weight, give the fund an equal interest in giant like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 compon alike.Whil thi might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how thi actual end up be someth veri import to overal returns. Michael discuss how nearli half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tie up in about 50 companies, and that the remain 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argu that the equal weight is a much more balanc way to achiev exposure, while thefund' fact sheetshow that thi approach ha outperform the market over long time periods.W also talk about the pro and con of thi approach, such as it potenti heavier weight in mid-cap secur and what thi mean for investors, as well as some import fund specifics. Thi includ inform regard the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for select a fund structure. We then go over the way that INDEX differ from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), look beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compar to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqu weight invest is an overlook strategi for target stocks, but it is clearli one that can lead to outperform over long time periods. If you are curiou about thi approach, check out thi podcast for everyth you need to know about how it works, and if thi can help improv return for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to thi edit ofth Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pro and con of thi approach are for those seek a differ way to play the S&P 500.

Warren Buffett Isn't Trying to Beat the Market,3/9/2017,"If you'r expect high return fromBerkshir Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) stock portfolio, you may want to pay attent to what Charli Munger ha to say, and then care reconsid your assumption.At the recentDaili Journalmeeting, Warren Buffett' sidekick, Charli Munger, explain that Buffett doesn't necessarili have high return in mind when he buy a stock for Berkshire' portfolio. Munger use Berkshir Hathaway' purchas ofExxonMobilstock as an exampl in how Buffett' invest process ha changed:[Y] know whi Warren bought Exxon? As a cash substitute. He would have never done that in the old days. We had a lot of cash and we thought Exxon wa better than cash over the short-term. That' a differ kind of think than the way Warren came up.makeArticleAd();Mung isn't kidding. Thi is veri differ than how Buffett ha tradit invested.Th Exxon tradeIn 2013, Berkshir paid $90.86 per share for it multibillion dollar Exxon stake. In the fourth quarter of 2014, when Berkshir liquid it investment, Exxon share trade for an averag of $93.27 per share, accord to a report byBloomberg. Thus, Buffett purchas and subsequ sold about $4 billion of Exxon stock in a round-trip that earn Berkshir sharehold a single-digit return after dividends. Most importantly, Berkshir wa in and out in less than two years.Thi quick trade is veri uncharacterist of Buffett, who is famou for take the long view. In hi 1996 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote: ""If you aren't will to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about own it for ten minutes.""That advice, it seems, no longer appli to how Berkshir manag it portfolio.Imag source: Getti Images.On of the most import lesson I'v ever learn as an investor is that there are no accid in disclosure, whether the contextu clue appear in SEC file or the document that accompani them. That' whi I find it so interest that Buffett went out of hi way to clarifi how Berkshir view it stock portfolio in hi annual letter to sharehold thi year.Buffett wrote the follow on page 20 of hi annual letter:Sometim the comment of sharehold or media impli that we will own certain stock ""forever."" It is true that we own some stock that I have no intent of sell for as far as the eye can see (and we'r talk 20/20 vision). But we have made nocommitmentthat Berkshir will holdanyof it market secur forever.H added, ""[W]e regard ani market secur as avail for sale, howev unlik such a sale now seems.""With that, Buffett make it clear that it portfolio of public stock is alway for sale, if the price is right, or if Berkshir ha better use for the cash. It' a curiou new detail, one that come just month after Berkshir put more than $16 billion to work purchas share ofAppleand four airlines, industri that Buffett might be will to invest in, but onli if he doesn't have to commit to hold forever.10 stock we like better than Berkshir Hathaway (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc.

Despit be name along with numer other giant of tech, the latest WikiLeak dump actual highlight a key advantag for Appl in particular.And while it aura of secur may emerg tarnished, the iPhon may actual come out ahead over the long term thank to WikiLeaks.What Wa in WikiLeak Vault 7?The latestWikiLeak dump involv 8,761 documentsoutlin a wide rang of CIA hack tools, includ viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojan and remot control systems.In addit there are 14 iO exploit listed, sever dozen Android vulner and method for access encrypt chat (essenti read the contentsbeforethey are encrypt by gain access to the host device).9 Stock to Buy That Are Grow Faster Than AmazonIt' not all smartphones, either. The CIA ha developedmalwar to infect computersrun macOS, Window and Linux. It' even capabl of turn Samsung Smart TV on their owners, use them as listen devic to record conversations.Thi Doesn't Look Good for AppleAppl ha long posit itself as a privaci advocate. It ha alway play up the secur of the iPhon and evenrefus an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneus by a shooter in 2015' San Bernardino terrorist attack.Appl CEO Tim Cook releas a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. govern ha ask us for someth we simpli do not have, and someth we consid too danger to create. They have ask us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""Th WikiLeak Vault 7 releas made it clear that iO wasn't as secur as Appl had thought.How Appl Could Come Out AheadWikiLeak is bad news for Appl in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hack of mobil devic and consum electron could actual be good news for the compani in the long run. Appl quickli went on record as say mani of the vulner identifi in the WikiLeak Vault 7 documentswer alreadi address with iO 10. And it is work to identifi and patch ani new issues.Appl and Googl chose veri differ strategi when it come to smartphones. Appl control everi aspect of iO - it mobil oper system - as well as the hardware. It push out new major new iO version yearli and updat releas (the kind that fix bug or secur issues) on demand. As a result,nearli 80% of all iPhon are current run iO 10.Googl also releas new version of Android yearly, but larg reli on smartphon manufactur and wireless carrier to approv and push updates. They have littl incent to do so, sinc lack the latest Android featur could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildli vari assort of smartphones, updat can often be problematic, lead to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajor are run softwar releas in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddress most of the issu in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundr of million of Android devic that could still be affectedbecaus they'r run old software. Most iPhon users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assur that Apple' consist program of releas will address ani outstand issues.Appl ha a similar approach with macOS. It updat it Mac comput oper system regularli and push out secur updat as issu are discovered. With the smart home,Appl take extrem secur measures, includ costli custom chips, factori inspect and end-to-end encrypt between connect devices. Thi approach ha meant slower adopt for it HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of be far more secur than the competition.A for smart TV eavesdrop on you, that' just anoth reason to buy a rel inexpens stream box - like an Appl TV - instead.Th Age of Privaci Is OverMani peopl had been live with a probabl naiv expect that everyth they did with their smartphon wa privat and secure, especi when use encrypt apps. The latest WikiLeak dump should end that notion and leav peopl watch their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc.

Sever have even remark that diversif is a wast of time and the onli way to make money in the market is to have a concentr equiti portfolio. Thi is all well and good, but it is realli not suitabl advic for the averag investor.makeArticleAd();Th most famou invest guru got where they are today by be good investors, but that is not to say there wa not a degre of luck involv as well.What would have happen toWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) if hisAmerican Express(AXP) invest had not work out and the Salad Oil scandal had taken down the company? Or ifCoca-Cola(KO) wa hit with such a massiv bout of neg public it could never recover? If either of these scenario unfolded, Buffett would not be where he is today.To give anoth example, what would have happen toCarl Icahn(Trades, Portfolio) if lawmak had view hi action at TWA as crimin and thrown him in jail?Ther are certainli case where thi ha happened, but becaus the rank of the world' most famou investor are stalk by survivorship bias, it is difficult to realiz that for everi one Buffett there are ten of thousand of fail investors.That is whi diversif is so import and critic for long-term invest success.Numb don't lieResearch by Arizona State Univers financ professor Hendrik Bessembind show exactli whi thi is the case. To tri and figur out the averag return of singl stock over the long term, he studi the return of 26,000 equiti over the period of 1926 to 2015. Over thi nine-decad period, equiti creat $31.8 trillion of wealth. The shock thing is that all of thi wealth wa gener by just 4% of equities; 96% of stock achiev nothing. Includ inflation, the real return on 96% of the univers wa actual negative. To put it anoth way, the averag investor ha a one in 24 chanc of pick a stock that will gener posit return over the long term.ExxonMobil(XOM) alon account for 3% of the wealth creat over the period andApple(AAPL) account for about 2%.These find are onli reinforc by a report issu by JPMorgan last year. Accord to the report, titl ""The Agoni & Ecstasy: The Risk And Reward Of A Concentr Stock Position,"" the return on the median stock sinc it incept versu an invest in the Russel 3000 Index is -54%.Furthermore, sinc 1980, 320 compani have been remov from the S&P 500 due to reason of ""distress."" So, dure the past three-and-a-half decades, 64% of the index ha been turn over. Base on these figures, JPMorgan calcul the chanc of actual find an extrem winner is just 7%. Sinc the 1980s, 40% of all compani experienc a sever loss and never recovered.Th bottom lineDiversif is not a bad strategy. Some of the world' most famou investor may advoc concentr portfolios, but as the figur abov show, you have to be veri lucki to correctli pick a stock that produc posit return over the long term. The chanc of pick a winner are so low it is hard to justifi even trying.

He let insur do what it' suppos to. He bookeda $5.6 billion chargeagainst earn last month, result ina $3 billion loss for the company' fourth quarter, becaus the compani it insur against properti and casualti claim suffer losses.That' the way insur is suppos to work. You bet that peopl won't suffer the catastroph their action could cause, but when those catastroph happen, you lose your money. Of course, when thing work out that way, Wall Street punish you.Lif is as unfair in New York as in Hollywood.Hancock' CrimesHancock' action were conserv in the best sense. He had previous paidBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) $10.2 billion to take 80% of AIG' reserv risk against it U.S. commerci insur exposur befor 2016.7 Cheap Dividend Stock to Buy NowTh reserv charg came to about $1.2 billion per year for 2013 to 2015, slightli more for 2016, and it should set the industri on cours to rais rates, and book fat profits, start later thi year, assum loss ratio return to normal.Hancock call hi decision""a dramat move to reduc uncertainty,""predict better time ahead. But Icahn doesn't want reduc uncertainty. What he want is a breakup of the compani so it will no longer be ""system important,"" allow it to reduc it capit cushion and allow him to book a fast profit.Icahn also want Hancock' head on a platter, and thi is be deliv to him,a soon as the board can instal a replacement. Hancock had been name CEO in 2014 to replac the late Robert Benmosche, after run AIG' properti insur unit for four years.Mayb AIG' properti insur price wa low under Hancock, but in a competit market you take the price you need to get the business, not the price you want. When invest return are great (a they have been for year now), a lot of player will take low prices, expect invest return to make up for ani losses.Ther is one area where Hancock wa charg rightfully.Th company' tech platform is a mess, and Hancock took the resign of CIO Philip Fasano over it earli thi month. Technolog is veri complicated, and AIG ha gener been late to the technolog disrupt party.A a result of it IT problems, the physic breakup of AIG will be harder than Icahn thinks.Icahn Bad for the EconomyIcahn' think is great for Icahn, but bad for the economy.Break up AIG mean it can hold less capit against losses, but it make all the piec more vulner to those losses. Instead of the one big collaps suffer by AIG' dumb bet on mortgag insur in the last decade, you could have a bunch of smaller collaps caus by rise risk to all insur from the Trump administration' denial of global warm and it pend militari buildup.Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Q4 Earn Beat, But They'r AWFULOf course, Icahn is as giddi as those schoolgirl over Presid Donald Trump.Our Tyler Craig recent call AIG""atrocious,""suggest an option trade to captur a downturn, but the Hancock resign revers the trend.

Make ""bets"" on a stock base on it recent percentag move doesn't make much sense, though, in a rage risk-on environ such as we'v seen sinc last November.makeArticleAd();Ov my career, I have found that appli a multi-time-fram approach to stock trade and invest not onli allow for better perspective, but as a result, also result in superior risk manag - and dare I say ""timing"" of trade entri and exits.I make it a point in thi column to often remind ye faith that stock are a highli correl asset class, particularli compar to other asset class such as commodities. While the price of pork belli ha littl correl with the price of gold, within the stock market, around 80% of stock tend to rise and fall togeth at ani given time. I point thi out becaus while the year-to-d ralli in AAPL stock is impress and worth respect until it reverses, there also ha been a broader stock market risk-on trade thu far in 2017.More than anything, I highlight thi for perspective.When I last discuss Appl stock onFeb. 2follow the latest earn report, I said that share were reach a critic technic area of resist through a multimonth lens. While AAPL ha sinc margin push abov thi technic area, the tale of two time frame remains.7 Cheap Dividend Stock to Buy NowToday, I would like to reiter and updat thi analysis.AAPL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekli chart, we see that Appl over the year ha greatli respect it 200-week simpl move averag (red), which wa a sourc of technic support in 2013 and again just last year.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, we also see that each time AAPL stock get overli extend abov thi move average, it tend to fall into a consolid phase. Currently, the stock trade roughli 30% abov thi move average; at past extremes, Appl trade as much as 50% abov it.From thi perspective, AAPL stock could have further to run on the upside.On the other hand, the MACD momentum oscil at the bottom of the chart ha now reach level that in the past led to some downsid pressure.Lastli - and I believ most importantli - the rate of chang (i.e., the near-vert ralli over the past coupl months) ha push AAPL stock back abov it 2015 highs. While thi in and of itself is a posit development, previou import high rare if ever are overcom on a sustain basi until and unless some consolid near those previou high ha taken place.Appl stock ha yet to consolidate. Thus, it like will find the current upsid momentum unsustain over the next few week or even months.Appl Inc. (AAPL) iPhon 8: New Name, Late Release?On the daili chart, we see that AAPL gap higher again follow it Jan. 31 earn report, and despit alreadi be overbought by plenti of measures, kept push higher as the broader stock market anim spirit brought in fresh momentum.Click to EnlargeNot that except for a coupl day in earli January, AAPL stock ha now held abov it 8-day simpl move averag (blue) sinc earli Decemb 2016. That is alongstretch to be trade abov such a near-term move average. I feel it increasingli beg for some consolid lower.At the same time, until thi move averag is broken on the downside, one must continu to respect the uptrend.Through thi near-term lens, if AAPL can close abov $140, a next squeez higher into $143 - $144 look plausible. Alternatively, a break and hold below $138.50 could set in motion a better consolid move lower with first downsid target near $136 and $132.Like what you see?

But like the proverbi frog oblivi to the rise in water temperatur until it' too late, say Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manag at BlackRock, investor are start to experi a stealthi increas in prices.Se Also:Rocki Road Ahead for Bond InvestorsTh consum price index rose 2.1% in 2016, way ahead of the 0.7% rise in 2015 and the 0.8% increas in 2014. One key reason is the rebound inoil prices, which have climb from $27 a barrel in earli 2016 to $53 today. Hous cost are rise at the quickest pace in nearli 10 year (seeHom Price Keep Climbing), and medic costs, which had been mostli moder sinc 2008, are tick higher again. Overall,Kipling see consum price rise 2.4% in 2017.The new presid will sure keep inflat on the front burner. ""Donald Trump ha put forward a set of idea that may involv higher fiscal deficits, a larg infrastructur build-out and protectionist trade policies, all of which could support higher inflation,"" say Orhan Imer, who special in inflation-link strategi at Columbia Threadneedl Investments.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');No one is talk about a return to the double-digit inflat of the late 1970s. Interconnect global market and technolog innov that improv product are power forc for hold down price increas for good and services. But that doesn't mean you can let your guard down. ""Even low level of inflat can be an insidi drag on your portfolio and erod your buy power,"" say Joanna Bewick, comanag of Fidel Strateg Real Return Fund (symbolFSRRX). Investor who have not done so alreadi should consid protect against such eros with some of these in­flat hedges.What to buy. Among your bond holdings, consid ad Treasuri inflation-protect securities. The princip valu of these govern issu is adjust each month to keep pace with inflation--so yield of 0.4% for TIP matur in 10 year look paltri befor you add the inflat rate. You can buy TIP directli from Uncl Sam atwww.treasurydirect.gov. Plan on hold your TIP until they mature.Investor who don't hold the bond to matur or who invest via fund should be awar that TIP prices, like those of most bonds, fall when interest rate rise--which is what normal happen when inflat is accelerating. GivenKiplinger' forecast for higher rate in 2017, fund investor should focu on portfolio that invest in short-term TIPS. Those fund will yield less than those that own longer-term TIPS, but they will be less sensit to rate swings. A good choic is Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protect Secur (VTiPX) or it exchange-trad namesak (VTIP, $49). Yield for both version are negative, but the fund should deliv posit return onc the inflat adjust are made. (Price and yield are as of Januari 31.)You can take advantag of the higher rate that go hand in hand with inflat with a floating-r fund. Such fund hold debt with rate that adjust along with a short-term benchmark. Mani of these fund invest in loan made by bank to compani with substandard credit ratings. But with the economi growing, default should remain manag for now. Fidel Float Rate High Incom (FFRHX, yield 3.3%) and PowerShar Senior Loan ETF (BKLN, $23, 2.6%),a member of the Kipling ETF 20, hold secur that are a littl higher in qualiti than some of their peers. If you want to minim credit risk and are will to accept a lower yield, tri IShar Float Rate Bond ETF (FLOT, $51, 1.1%), which hold bond with investment-grad ratings.Stock will crater if there' an in­flat shock--someth on the order of an oil embargo or food crisis--but should beat inflat over the long haul. However, some stock sector do better with inflat than others. InvesTech Research, a market research firm, look at eight period of acceler inflat from 1950 through 2012 and found that energy, materi and industri stocks, among the most sensit to swing in the economy, were top performers; rate-sensit sector such as util and telecommun lag the market. When consum are watch everi penny, ""you want to go with compani that have good brand and a competit advantage, that can rais price and make them stick,"" say Chri Zaccarelli, chief invest offic at Cornerston Wealth, base in Charlotte, N.C.Think compani such as Appl (AAPL, $121) and Walt Disney Co. (DIS, $111). Strategist at Goldman Sach recommend compani with low labor cost as a percentag of revenues; their bottom line won't suffer as much as those of high-wag firm as pay rises. The group includ insur Aflac (AFL, $70), food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM, $44), pharmaci benefit manag Express Script (ESRX, $69) and homebuild PulteGroup (PHM, $22).Commod price respond quickli to increas in demand when the economi is growing. They'r often the first signal of rise inflation, as well as a hedg against it. The downsid is their notori volatility. Commod price have been on the upsw sinc earli 2016, revers a nearli 50% slide from April 2014. Harbor Commod Real Return Strategi (HACMX) is a commod fund with a twist. It manag use some of the fund' asset to buy deriv that track the price of oil, metal and agricultur commodities. With the rest of the assets, they assembl an activ manag portfolio of TIP and other bonds. You can gain exposur to commod indirectli via SPDR S&P Global Natur Resourc ETF (GNR, $43), which hold stock in the energy, agriculture, and metal and mine sectors.Y may be surpris to learn that gold is not the inflat hedg it' crack up to be. It ha outpac in­flat onli about half the time in success 12-month period start in Decemb 1973. Still, if inflat expect acceler sharply, gold, which also provid portfolio protect in time of geo­polit upheaval, would like perform well, say BlackRock' Koesterich. Consid put a small amount of asset in a low-cost exchange-trad product, such as iShar Gold Trust (IAU, $12), which charg 0.25% annually.R estat is a classic inflat hedge, as anyon who own a home is well aware. You can also own real estat indirectly, through a real estat invest trust that own commerci properties. REIT give investor a twofer in time of rise inflation, say Kevin Brosious, an invest advis in Allentown, Pa. The valu of the underli real estat appreci along with inflation, while rent paid by tenant rise, too. One fund worth a look is T. Row Price Real Estat (TRREX, 2.3%), whose manager, David Lee, ha been at the helm sinc 1997. He seek REIT that he think will grow consist and that trade below the valu of their underli assets. If you prefer an index approach, check out Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH, $41, 3.3%),a member of the Kipling ETF 20. It charg just 0.07% annually.Fidel Strateg Real Return offer a one-stop inflat solution. The fund, which yield 1.0%, ha roughli 30% of it asset in TIPS, 25% in floating-r loans, 25% in deriv that track price of a basket of commod (split evenli among energy, metal and agricultur products) and 20% in real estate-link stock and bonds. The fund' 10-year return of 2.4% annual won't blow you away, but it four-prong strategy, test back to 1973, would have beaten inflat in 81% of 12-month periods.Se Also:8 Dow Stock Rais Dividend for 25 Year"

Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Is Becoming a ‘Battleground Stock’,3/8/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ha pull back sharpli over the past few weeks. Nvidia stock hit an all-tim close high of $119.31 on Feb. 8. At that point, Nvidia had risen $370% in just a year, and wa up nearli six time in the past 24 months.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGiven the optim toward NVDA, a revers in that trend seem highli unlikely.Sinc then, however, NVDA stock ha pull back sharpli - in a bull market, no less.Nvidia trade more than 15% lower than it did bare three week ago. A modest selloff follow Q4 earn in earli February, despit number that came in well abov expectations. Sinc then, a seri of analyst downgrad and overal valuat concern have pull the high-fli stock back to Earth.From here, the declin seem to make some sense. Nvidia ha done a fantast job of drive growth the past few years. Fiscal 2017 (end January) revenu increas 55%; net incom more than doubled. But valuat matters, too, and NVDA stock had reach at a point that in retrospect look unsustainable.With Nvidia still trade at 36 time FY18 consensu EPS, there could be more downside.Th NVDA Stock Bear AwakenTh first sign that NVDA wa see valuat question came after it Q4 earn report earli last month. The headlin number in the quarter were huge impressive. EP of $1.13 beat estim by 30 cents; revenu growth of 55% wa more than four point higher than expected. In morn trade the next day, Nvidia stock clear $120.The 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut it couldn't hold those gains; share wound up declin 2% on the day. Nvidia declin anoth 7% in the next session, with investor appear to take profit after the huge bull run.Two week after the earn report, NVDA wa rock by two analyst downgrades:Instinet analyst Romit Shahcut the stockto ""Reduce,""larg cite valuat concerns. Shah point to two previou product cycl - motherboard CPU in 2007 and the Tegra chip line in 2011 - which had driven similar optim toward NVDA stock. In both cases, NVDA multipl had compressed. In thi case, with Nvidia' enterprise-value-to-sal ratio have jump from 2x to 7x in just a year, Shah argu a similar, potenti dangerous, cycl wa occurring.BMO Capit Marketsad it own downgradeth same day,cit a ""perfect storm"" of fundament that had driven the stock higher. BMO' target wa actual lower than that of Instinet: $85 versu $90. The firm, like Instinent, highlight valuat concerns, while also see tougher competit in 2017.The combin of two somewhat rare ""Sell""-equival rate sent NVDA stock almost 10% in a singl day.Do the Bear Case for Nvidia Stock Hold Water?Oth analyst have come to Nvidia' defense. Goldman Sachsmaintainedth stock on it ""Convict Buy"" list. Mizuho & UB both respond with ""buy the dip"" arguments. All three analyst set a target price for NVIDIA stock around $130, impli close to 30% upsid from current levels.But the downgrad clearli have made a dent in the narr surround NVDA - and with good reason, I believe.Valu wa stretched, with the stock at $120 trade at 40x 2017 EP even exclud the company' $8 per share in net cash. As strong as FY17 result were, Nvidia still is a semiconductor company. That' a difficult, highli cyclic business, one where growth is difficult and multipl stay compressed.Product cycl tend to limit long-term growth trajectories. Moore' Law - and competit - both mean that price gener declin over the cycle, pressur margin and profits.That' whi even grow chip maker tend to have low valuations. BothCypress Semiconductor Corporation(NASDAQ:CY) andMellanox Technologies, Ltd.(NASDAQ:MLNX) trade right around 14 time forward earnings.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is valu even lower, though it ha some growth problems. (Instinet analyst Shah suggest investor swap INTC for NVDA, in part due to valuation.)Th pullback in Nvidia stock make some sense, simpli from a valuat standpoint. Even NVDA bear are forecastingsomegrowth - it' a question of how much, and at what price.And competit isn't to be ignored. Most notably, in automotive, Nvidia will go head-to-head with industri leaderMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY).I think MBLi is overvalued, and similar over-enthusiasm may be boost NVDA stock as well.How to Buy Advanc Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock the RIGHT WaySimpli put, growth will get more difficult for Nvidia go forward. That' the natur of the semiconductor space. And slow growth isn't price into NVDA stock - even after the 15% pullback.How to Play NVDA From HereAt thi point, Nvidia look more reason valu - even if I think it' a bit overpriced.A short of Nvidia stock seem too aggress at thi point, to be sure, but a long play might be too early. It seem like that NVDA will be a battleground for the next few months, with bull and bear argu over the outlook. That will drive some volatility, but like not much in the way of movement.I'd think bull and bear alik might consid let the dust settl here, particularli until first-quart earn in May. Both side make some good points, and both side will continu to make those points.I doubt either the bull or the bear will make much progress, however, until at least the next earn report.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Stock to Buy That Are Grow Faster Than AmazonI Caterpillar Inc.

If Appl doe not increas Cirrus' content in it phone or cut it product volumes, the latter' financi perform get sever impacted.

Consensu estim indic that it revenu will grow onli 6.5% in fiscal year 2018 as compar to estim gain of 31% in the current fiscal year.Cirru need the power of diversif in order to sustain it strong revenu growth and avoid Apple-rel fluctuations. The good news for Cirru investor is that there are two key technolog that could help it diversifi not just in smartphon but into other industri as well.Voic biometr will be a big dealCirrus' research in voic biometr will play a major role in it push to diversifi itself as thi technology, which allow peopl to interact with their devic via voice, will find applic in a varieti of fields.

Banks, for instance, are increasingli deploy voic biometrics. BothBarclaysandHSBCstart use voic recognit to secur identifi custom last year.What' more, the adopt of voic biometr in mobil devic is also expect to pick up pace go forward. Appl itself file a patent last Februari relat to voice-recognition-bas authentication. Apple' patent file say that:A devic can be configur to receiv speech input from a user. The speech input can includ a command for access a restrict featur of the device. The speech input can be compar to a voiceprint (e.g., text-independ voiceprint) of the user' voic to authent the user to the device.Cirru can capit on the possibl of Appl deploy voic biometr in it futur phone as it is all set to ""tape out"" it first compon in 2017. Cirru manag say that the compani will start sampl it voice-biometrics-en compon in the quarter that run Juli Septemb of 2017.Cirru believ that it could start gener revenu from thi technolog after the next fiscal year ends. Therefore, it won't be surpris if Cirrus' growth get back on track after a weak fiscal 2018 onc it launch it voic biometrics-en chips.Act nois cancel is a more immedi catalystTechSci Research forecast that the market for earphon and headphon could surpass $19 billion in revenu over the next five year as smartphon maker tri to deliv a superior audio experi to customers. The use of activ nois cancel (ANC) technolog is one way to deliv an immers audio experience.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , for instance, is expect to sell ANC-en wireless headphon alongsid the upcom Galaxi S8. Samsung believ that the use of ANC will allow it to cut out ambient nois by a maximum of 20 decibel and result in a better audio experience, which will give it a differenti factor against rivals.An immers audio experience, however, will not come cheap as Samsung is expect to charg 130 euro (or $138 approximately) for the headphones. Now, Cirrus' first headset with ANC technolog is expect to be launch soon. As Samsung is one of it customers, it is like that a Cirru chip is power the Korean giant' ANC-en headphone.What' more, Cirru is alreadi in talk with more custom for it ANC headset and seem to have land a few design win already. As the design win materi and the adopt of voic biometr and ANC gain traction, Cirru Logic will find new avenu to augment it growth.

The backlash wa bad enough that CEO Ek wrote anoth blog post, aptli call ""SORRY"" in order to explain that user don't have to share thi inform if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permiss befor access ani of thi data - and we will onli use it for specif purpos that will allow you to custom your Spotifi experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Ov the past few year or so, Spotifi ha been on the hunt for new funding. The compani close fund round in 2012 and 2013, rais $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotifi complet a whop $526 million round of funding, put it at a valuat of roughli $8.5 billion, a move that show investor it desir for expans and new form of content-a few month befor thi fund round, Spotifi announc it plan to add video and podcast from partner like ESPN, NBC, Comedi Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the compani rais $1 billion in convert debt on the promis that it new investor will receiv a 30% discount on share when it file for an IPO. Spotifi will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more everi six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goe public.Thi decis to rais money through convert debt wa a smart move, as Spotifi wa abl to maintain it high valuat without dilut it exist shareholders. It doe suggest the compani is serious think about an IPO, sinc the latest round of fund encourag Spotifi to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that' what wa origin thought.Accord toTechCrunch, Spotifi is appar consid delay it IPO to 2018, with sourc say the compani want to use the time to ""build a better balanc sheet and work on shift it busi model to improv it margins.""

Nevertheless, it impress valuation-aTechCrunchsourc hope to target a valuat between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popular will work in their favor when their public debut comes.

"Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?",3/8/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcom flagship smartphon continu to be the subject of intens speculation. With the countdown on to final design and start product of the new iPhone, two detail in particular have seen conflict theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggest AAPL will go with the iPhon Edit - instead of iPhon 8 or 10th anniversari iPhon - for it flagship model.Th websit also feel it ha nail the display size, and agre with a previou report that the new iPhon could arriv significantli later than usual.iPhon 8 = iPhon Edition?What to call the new iPhon is actual a big deal thi year. The regular name sequenc will continu with the iPhon 7s and iPhon 7s Plus. Those are the phone for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expect to releas -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebr a decad in the busi (and hope help to propel sale to stratospher levels)?Th iPhon X, 10th Anniversari iPhon and iPhon 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversari iPhonenextyear? And iPhon 8 would mess up Apple' name scheme for it mainstream models.Appl Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhon Edition. The premium Appl Watch model is the Appl Watch Edition, so the preced ha alreadi been set and it would be consistent. Thi would also solv the continu problem associ with name a new iPhon specif around the 10th anniversary, without mess up the current iPhon name scheme. iPhon Edit make sense.About the New iPhon DisplayOutsid of whether it would be curv or not, or OLE or not, there have been conflict report about the display' size. Most analyst have been call for a 5.8-inch display with bezel practic eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhon that' smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhon 7 Plus.It' a similar approach to whatSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appear to have taken with the Galaxi S8.However,Mac Otakaraha alway maintain - and still insist - that the new iPhon will have a 5-inch display. Which seem weird, given the consum prefer for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnect the dotsand theoriz that the inform given to the Japanes websit is for theusablespace. The remain display area would be where AAPL ha a row of virtual button - a featur that ha alreadi been mention as replac the Home button and mimick the function of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Tak a 5.8-inch display, reserv the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effect a 5-inch display in term of what the owner can make use of.Th math is start to add up.iPhon Edit Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagre with the grow number of analyst who are predict the iPhon 8 - or iPhon Edit - is go to face a delay release.A few day ago,9to5 Macreport the iPhon 7s seri would go into product in July, as expected. But there are rumor that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integr into the new iPhon Edition' display is prove challenging. The ad manufactur complex may push mass product for the new flagship model to September. That would mean sever suppli constraints, includ the possibl that theiPhon Edit would not begin ship until a month after the iPhon 7s, with onli earli pre-ord be deliv in 2017.If the product issu turn out to be true, the result could be problemat … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Appl would face the possibl that potenti iPhon 7s buyer hold off until they can physic compar it against the iPhon Edition, delay that wave of upgrades. Potenti iPhon Edit buyer could also shrug and order the iPhon 7s instead, not wish to wait a few month for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhon Edit together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularli record-smash launch sale weekend it is gun for to celebr that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sale that accompani everi new iPhon releas could be extended. The iPhon 7s would get the first rush, follow by the iPhon Edition.It' possible.A always, stay tuned. At thi stage, everyth we ""know"" about the new iPhon is speculation. But with AAPL' suppli chain start to crank up for production, the piec are begin to fall into place.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Intel Corporation Is Unlikely to Lose the Apple Inc. Mac Anytime Soon,3/6/2017,"Rumor are swirl that microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be on the verg of lose it spot as the supplier of the processor that powerApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products.Hypothes rang from Apple' design it own chip for the Mac to specul that Appl will use chip from altern processor vendors. However, I believ that base on Intel' recent commentari at it Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlik that the compani is go to lose these orders.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel' CCG financi guidanceIf Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor orders, thi would manifest as a reduct in the company' Client Comput Group (CCG) revenu and oper profits. If we estim that Appl pay an averag of $200 for Intel processor and relat components, then that' $4 billion in revenu that could potenti be at risk.Put anoth way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop significantly), then Intel could potenti see more than 10% of it CCG revenu vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world, but it' the sort of thing that would sting.At it investor day, Intel said that it expect it revenu in CCG to declin at a ""low-single-digits"" pace -- or an averag of 1%-3% annual over the next three years. If we compound the low and high end of that range, Intel is plan for between a 3% and a 9% declin in CCG revenu from 2016 level by the end of 2019.Here' a translat to hard dollar figures: Intel is plan for CCG revenu to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3 billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the midpoint.At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in hi investor meet present that he expect the PC processor total address market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2 billion down from where the compani peg the total address market in 2016.Put the number togetherIf Intel expect the PC processor total address market to drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is plan for ""low-single-digit"" declin in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion declin at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the compani is guid for signific personal-comput processor revenu share loss.Now, it' worth note that forecast thi long out aren't go to be perfect, but Intel like ha visibl into the personal-comput design win pipelin at it variou customers, includ Apple. If Appl were prepar to shift away from Intel processor for Mac releas over the next coupl of years, then Intel would like be awar of that immin shift and should have includ that expect in it multi-year forecast.Bas on thi analysis, I don't think Intel investor ought to worri too much about Apple' switch away from Intel processor anytim soon in it MacBook or iMac products.Ov the long term, however, anyth is possible, so Intel will have to make sure that it ha an increasingli compel product pipelin to keep Appl interested.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extrem well. It' good to hear your voice. It' been awhile, a month or two, sinc we last had a podcast, and I miss you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it' been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-import question.Rosevear:What' the question?O'Reilly:You'r the onli guy I know who can answer thi for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it' veri tiring, I want to know when I'm go to get my self-driv car.Rosevear:Well, it depend on what you mean by get, and realli depend on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touch the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let' back up and defin some term here. Thi system of classif for thing that assist driver ha becom pretti universal. It wa develop by the Societi of Automot Engin in the U.S. The U.S. govern ha adopt it, other govern have adopt it, it' the way all automak talk now. They categor it in six level that are help number from zero to five. A level zero system, there' no automation, the driver doe everything. Thi might even includ warn system like lane departur warning. But, the driver actual ha to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assist that parallel park for you, that kind of stuff. That' a level one system.O'Reilly:Do that includ anti-lock brakes? I'm surpris that' on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Ey of the beholder?Rosevear:Th driver is still execut that. They count that as an intervent system. It' when the car decid to break for you that it start to becom assisted. These emerg stop system that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the level one through five requir some level of sens what' go on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park system where the car spin the wheel for you and back into the spot, that kind of thing, that' a level one. Level two is where it start to get interesting. Thi is the system where you'r on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, mayb the earliest version of Tesla' autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust it speed rel to the car around to you, and it will keep itself in it lane. It' do a littl steer and a littl acceler and deceler on it own. But there still ha to be a human driver, the human driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these system requir you to actual touch the wheel everi minut or two, or someth like that. Level three is when it kind of get into self driving. Thi is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, thi is where Tesla' autopilot is start to go, thi is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruis that will come out on Cadillac soon, thi is where it end up, level three.O'Reilly:Sup Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That' what they call it. That' what they'v been call it for a few years, I'm not complet sure that' what they'r go to call it when it come to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it' self-driv until suddenli it isn't, the driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. That make it a littl tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.O'Reilly:Th Motley Fool' Dan Spark did that articl about a year ago, he live out in Colorado and he ha a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touch the wheel on the freeway with that thing.Rosevear:Tesla' offici instruct with the origin system where you'r suppos to touch the wheel regularly, they consid it an advanc level two system. I think now they'r into level three territory. The border here is a littl bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is drive itself, period. It doe not need you, but it' limited. Usual what it mean is it' limit to an area that' been mapped, we say it' been geofenced. These system tend to depend on veri highli detail 3D map that show stuff that normal map don't show, like exactli where the curb is within a coupl inch and so forth, so the car can navig precisely, especi on a citi street. So, it' full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steer wheel, but it onli work where the car ha a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to thi in a minut -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherev you want under ani conditions. If it' snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.So, what we'r talk about in the near futur is level four, a car that will self-driv itself. Thi is come soon. But it' limit by it maps. The idea is, gradual the map will expand over time and you'll be abl to drive --O'Reilly:Ar there citi that are be map right now? I'm actual surpris to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is be mapped. Thi is where Uber is do their testing, a lot of it. Thi is actual where Ford' new compani they creat as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google' self-driv car project run it. Thi is basic Ford' softwar team for self-driving, and they'r in Pittsburgh. There' been a lot of map done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, becaus the artifici intellig lab at Carnegi Mellon is the sourc of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the peopl are there. There' some map go on in San Francisco. I know GM' cruis autom subsidiari is do test of level four assist in San Francisco, so they have map go on. Then, there are compani map all over the place. Tesla, I think, is autom some of thi map with the sensor on their exist cars. A compani calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) is go to start do map with sensor on their customers' cars, these are sensor for level two system but they can help do the map for level four. Thi is go to start veri soon, probabl next year for Mobileye. There are privat compani tri to do this, too, hope to be abl to sell the map to the automak or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in thi is, of course, Waymo. Google' been map for year and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You'v seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of camera on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That' how I can see what my dentist' offic look like from across the street. They'r map citi with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybodi is. And it' not just map for Googl Maps, it' map at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car know what to expect as it' driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from it sensors. If it' dark out, if it' foggy, if the lighter system is be buggi for whatev reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Becaus these are safeti systems, there ha to be redund built in. That' the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is thi stuff come out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantli doe these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolut for sure when they'll be readi to ship it. There' also an interest question there that with their owner of their current models, they'v been ship stuff that mayb ha some bug still in it for the owner to bang on. And becaus Tesla owner tend to be earli adopt types, they'r mostli cool with that. As Tesla move into the mass market with it upcom Model 3, someth els we'v talk about, I don't know if they'r go to tighten it up a littl bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, thi partnership of giant auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machin vision specialist that ha done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicli traded, right? For our listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, becaus if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that' as close as it gets. The third compani in thi isIntel, which is design the processors. They'r work togeth on a level four system. We'v talk about thi before. They will have thi avail to ani automak who want it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the car are go to ship in 2019. These thing are incorpor as the car are developed. So, probabl late 2020, earli 2021, peopl will be ship car with thi system in, but those car may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here' what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, ""We'r go to mass produc a level four vehicl start in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we'r not go to sell it at retail. Thi is go to be for car share use in citi and ride hail services, Lyft and Uber and so on."" It' becaus of the maps. They onli want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Field at Ford ha said, ""We'r not even go to give it a steer wheel in this,"" so obvious it ha to have the maps. Again, as the map expand, there'l be more. Ford is say right now that they think they'll have level four function in their retail vehicl 2025-ish. But they alway say that, Bill Ford, execut chairman of Ford, alway says, ""We throw out these dates, but it' alway earlier than I expect."" So, we'll see. Right now they'r say 2025. So, yeah, he says, ""Thi stuff move much faster than we expect."" There' also some other stuff go on. The thing to emphas here, I should back up a littl bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech compani talk about what they'r doing. There will be surpris here. Thi is just, what ha been announced, what we have seen, what we gener know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, onc you go public with someth you get held to it in some capacity, and nobodi want to get egg on their face.Rosevear:Right. And GM origin said they'd launch Super Cruis in 2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a differ name for that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They'r a level three system. They came out a while back and said, ""Wait a minute, we'r not happi with it, we'r go to do more work and make it more advanced. We'r not go to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probabl around there."" But again, they are not hold themselv to a firm date on that. In fact, they'r not hold themselv to a firm date on a lot of thi stuff. Mari Barra' thing is, ""We'll ship it when it' ready."" But what we do know is that GM is plan to actual start build a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedli in the thousands. These will be the electr Chevi Volts. They will be fit with prototyp level four systems, and they will go into thi massiv test with Lyft in sever differ cities. So, when will you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is whi they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it' someth like that. It' a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a drive car? If you'r in D.C., you might get one in sever month from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphon and a Chevi Volt comes. Uber is alreadi do thi on a tini scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 car or someth that are prototyp self-driv vehicl in their fleet. With these things, there are two engin on board. One is readi to grab the wheel and the other one is take note on everyth that' happen with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driv vehicles. So it might not seem all that excit becaus there' somebodi in the front seat, but the car is drive itself, is the idea. Thi is a way to rack up a whole lot of test mile quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these thing out there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless car handl all the roundabout in D.C., that'll be a treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotari up here in New England, we have lot of them too. It'll be interest to see how they handl Boston, which is coloni era street in some area of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they'r made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definit not driverless cars. But, there' other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiari that use to be the Googl Self-Driv Car Project and ha now been set up as a compani to go into busi and commerci thi in some way. Who will partner with them? They had thi littl deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivan as test vehicl that took on their latest prototyp system. They'v been talk toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there' a certain view in the auto industri that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil becaus Googl will want all the data. And then you'r an Android phone maker, and Google' make all the money. That is a great fear. I think everi auto CEO in the world is mind of the exampl of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actual a lot of the sell proposit of the Delphi-Mobiley system, thi is a system develop within the establish auto industri supplier structure. We'll share the map among our fellow automak and so forth, but we'r not sell the data to Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think ha been go on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Googl ha those tini littl white go-kart look driverless car for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them tri to make a buck off of them at all. It' weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and execut name John Krafcik. He had been the presid ofTrueCar, and befor that, he had been in the busi for years. He wa with sever automakers, in manag capacities, execut capacities. He' a guy who know the business, a good guy, smart guy. Hi job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring thi stuff to market somehow. He' been out there talk to automakers. He actual did a realli big present at the North American Intern Auto Show in Detroit in Januari -- I wa go to say last month, but it' March now. He wa talk about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototyp level four system. I think he wa there, in part, fish for automak who might want to have conversation. It' possibl those convers have happen and nobodi is talk about them. The one that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, becaus the latest test vehicl are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:W don't have thi as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listen are on the tip of their tongu with this, they want to hear, what is Appl up to? They have that big plan, and I'v got a push notif fromTh Wall Street Journala year ago that Appl wa go to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pull back on it, they'r do test again. What is Tim Cook scheme right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I rememb when thatWal Street Journalth came out.O'Reilly:Y got the notif too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actual poke a few sourc and end up write a big piec for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morn after that broke, sort of, what doe thi mean, can they actual do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Appl ha so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I rememb you talk about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it' about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factori and they'r bang out car and it' realli high level of qualiti and so forth. Full boat. That' Tim Cook' lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margin in the car business, by Apple' standards, are pretti lousy. A luxuri car busi might make an oper margin of 10-12%. If you'r Porsche, you might make 16%. That' kind of the upper limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possibl that Googl and Appl wind up drop the brain in these car and call it a day? Googl already, they must have ton of data on these car operating.Rosevear:Googl ha made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, ""We'r not build cars, we'r not go to build a car factory, we are not build cars. We'r look for partnerships, we are not build cars."" Appl hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, thi program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the peopl who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the busi have been let go. Peopl work on electr self-driv car are in veri hot demand these days. So, none of these peopl are want for employment. But it wa thought that a lot of those folk were let go, and they realli ratchet down the ambit of the program. They may be aim to do someth where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple- a self drive car built by somebodi else. It' possibl that they will find an automak to partner with, and mayb offer that as a delux ride hail option. My thought when they were origin talk about thi wa that they were go to build the delux Appl version of robot Uber, where it' a littl bit more money but it' a nicer car, and it recogn all your Appl devic and it' thi seamless experience, it see your iPhon and it automat set your seat and your climat and your music and everyth els and all thi stuff, it take exactli where you want to go, and it' just a subscript model, $500 a month for the Appl Car service. That' where I thought they were go to go. Other disagreed. Some of my fellow Fool who are also veri close watcher of thi kind of technolog and particularli close watcher of Appl thought they might actual build a car for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We'r about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magic go to get my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it' probabl a few year beyond that. Somebodi may surpris us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that ha a fairli big map. But I'm think it might be over the next coupl year after that that these start to be avail for retail. I suspect the first one that come out, it will be an expens option on a luxuri car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, onc again, for your time.Rosevear:It' alway a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagin that as thi continu to ramp up, thi will not be our last show about thi topic.Rosevear:Oh, heaven no. We'll be talk about thi for sever year to come. It' a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again!Rosevear:Al right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye. That' it for us, folks.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?,3/6/2017,"Mobil chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chines smartphon giantXiaomiar often consid close partners. Qualcomm becam one of Xiaomi' earliest investor in 2011, and all of Xiaomi' flagship devic use Qualcomm chips. When regulatori troubl in China forc Qualcomm to renegoti it licens term with OEMs, Xiaomi wa one of the first compani tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that allianc gradual weakened. Xiaomi eventu start use moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chip in it cheaper devices, and ongo rumor indic that the compani wa develop first-parti chips. Those rumor were final confirm in late February, when Xiaomi unveil the Surg S1 chip for it new mid-rang Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi' Mi5c. Imag source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();Th Surg S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which run at 2.2GHz with anoth four run at 1.4GHz. It Mali T-860 MP4 GPU is capabl of play 4K videos. Those spec make it slightli more power than Qualcomm' Snapdragon 625, a popular octa-cor processor which power mid-rang devic like the intern variant of Xiaomi' Mi Note 4. The S1 wa produc by Xiaomi' subsidiari Pinecon Electron via a partnership with Chines chipmakerLeadcore.Whi Xiaomi need to make it own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi becam the biggest smartphon maker in China. But by the end of 2016, it had drop to fifth place afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That declin wa caus by competitor flood the market with compar price phones, a shift in consum tast toward pricier devices, and an overal slowdown across the Chines smartphon market.Last November, Xiaomi admit that it core phone busi wasn't profitable. In January, it stop disclos annual shipment figur and abruptli announc that it would skip thi year' Mobil World Congress. Those move all indic that the compani wa struggl to stay afloat in the crowd Chines market.However, Xiaomi also notic that it could follow Apple, Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-parti ARM chips. Produc first-parti chip is a pricey investment, but it' a smart long-term play becaus it reduc Xiaomi' depend on chipmak like Qualcomm, cut product costs, tighten up the suppli chain, and give it full control over the hardwar and the softwar -- which could better optim it devic for Xiaomi' MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi' Mi Air Purifier. Imag source: Xiaomi.In addit to lower cost and boost performance, IDC analyst Bryan Ma also note that Xiaomi' first-parti chip could work better with it smart home ecosystem, which alreadi includ air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers. Xiaomi could also use it first-parti chip to bypass a ban on MediaTek chip in India, which occur due to a patent disput withEricsson.What thi mean for QualcommXiaomi' introduct of first-parti chip isn't good news for Qualcomm, but there' no indic that Xiaomi will stop use Qualcomm chip altogether. The Mi 5c mere repres the budget devic of it flagship Mi 5 famili -- which includ the origin Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5 devic use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surg S1 could actual hurt MediaTek -- which suppli Xiaomi with chip for variant of it low and mid-rang devic -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surg S1 becom Xiaomi' offici mid-rang chipset, it could stop use MediaTek chip as Qualcomm chip remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm' Snapdragon could lose it spot in mid-rang devic like the Mi Note 4, but the overal impact on it chipmak busi might be minimal. Xiaomi' global market share is alreadi like below 5%, base on IDC estimates, and could continu fade as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices. SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devic use Qualcomm chips, higher sale at those lead brand could easili offset ani design loss at Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investor be worried?If Xiaomi had reveal the Surg S1 back in 2014, then swap out all Qualcomm chip with it own silicon, I think investor would have been worried. But Xiaomi is mere aim it new chip at the mid-rang market today, and ani loss from Xiaomi could probabl be offset by higher sale of other rival Android devices.Therefore, investor shouldn't consid Xiaomi' announc to be a major blow to Qualcomm on it own. Nonetheless, the overal trend is worrisome, becaus it indic that Qualcomm' chipmak busi -- which post flat year-over-year sale growth last quarter -- will like continu cede market share to first-parti ARM chip for the forese future.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is Perfect for Income Investors,3/7/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSinceHom Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) ""crushed"" earn estim on Feb. 21, you would think the HD stock price would be rocket upward, right?makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Wrong.Hom Depot stock start Mar. 7 lower than it did immediatelyaft report those results: Net earn of $1.74 billion - $1.44 per share - on revenu of $22.21 billion, a 5.8% year-over-year sale increase. Thi handili beat estim of $1.35 per sharein earnings.Th compani also set a $15 billion HD stock repurchas plan and hike the dividend from 69 cent per share to 89 cents.Th market' reaction? Mostli yawns.You can argu that the reason for that is market anticip of a good report. Home Depot stock is up 9.7% for the year, and 17% over the last 12 months.7 Stock to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buy RangeBut I think someth els is go on with HD stock … I think the natur of the company' invest case is changing.HD Stock: From Capit Gain to YieldTh compani wa found in 1978, around the time ofAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), and sinc come public in 1981 it ha had an Apple-lik trajectory. Home Depot stock ha split nine time in those 36 years, and a dollar invest at the IPO is now worth over $420,000.Thi is whi co-found Berni Marcu could build hi hometown of Atlanta a giant aquarium and still be worth$4.1 billion, while hi partner, Arthur Blank, could buy the Atlanta Falcon and be worth$3.4 billion. The compani ha about 2,200 store and domin it market.But there is a natur limit to the middl of the home improv market, as there isn't (yet) in the device-and-cloud business. With fiscal 2017 sale of over $94 billion, Home Depot is bump up against those limits. Growth ha slow to a steadi $5 to $6 billion in sale each year, net incom is level at about 8% of sales.Th company' board ha been do the wise and natur thing: They'r share the wealth with shareholders. The dividend wa 29 cent per share five year ago, and will now be 89 cent when it is paid out later thi month. That' a huge increase, and incom investor who bought HD stock in 2012 at about $48 per share are now earn $3.56 per share on that money.Don't let the current yield of 2.42%, base on the Home Depot stock price of $147, fool you. Thi is a yield play - not a growth play - for the future.HD' Chang PerformanceYield investor are not like growth investors.When you are look for income, an incom investor won't watch the daili averag the way a growth investor would. So long as the dividend is rising, or just stay level, an incom investor will hang on until death or taxes.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!On result is that yield play tend to be less volatil stock than growth plays, and the volatil becom more predict and more seasonal.Thi can be seen instori about Home Depot options.Opt can deliv big return on tini chang in a stock' price, and a regular pattern helps.Th pattern for HD stock indic that some backing-and-fil is due follow earnings, and that' precis what is happening. The recent price action, in other words, is predictable.Bottom Line on Home Depot StockDo thi mean HD stock is no longer a great stock? For a growth investor, as I have been, there are better investments, and I sold out my posit a few month ago, at a fat profit.On the other hand, if you are an incom investor and if you'r retir and need to make money on your money to live out your day in comfort, then Home Depot stock is a great invest for you. As is often said in Atlanta, that 2.42% yield is go to rise-up over time, as the compani continu to share it profit with you.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

But it is notabl that the IBB, as a result of the recent rally, ha now reach an import technic level on the chart that may offer better technic resistance.A simpl yet effect ""trick"" that I repeatedli use to gaug the intern strength of the broader stock market is by check the puls of the so call ""risk-on"" groups. While these group chang over the years, they often includ technolog and financi stocks. In recent years, biotech, tech as a whole and small-cap stocks, among others, have led the risk-on pack.Ov the past few weeks, biotech stock and the IBB ETF have show both absolut and rel strength versu the broader stock market. Through thi lens, one could argu that it is prematur to get too defens on the stock market in the near-term and possibl the intermediate-term until biotech stock begin to back off some.When I last discuss the state of biotech stock onFeb. 1, I offer that the IBB' bullish revers from Jan. 31 could be the begin of a next swing higher with price target in the $285-$290 area. Two week later, the upper end of thi price target had been reached, and last week the IBB ETF further extend thi ralli into the $300 level.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017Now, let' look at the charts.IBB ETF ChartsOn the multiyear weekli chart, we see that thi recent ralli ha brought the IBB back to the veri upper end of a sideway channel, which now also line up with the 100-week simpl move averag (blue).Click to EnlargeThi confluenc of technic resist around the $300 area could provid a more meaning challeng to be overcome.On the daili chart, we see that last week, the IBB alreadi margin push abov previou horizont technic resist from August and Septemb 2016.Click to EnlargeMoreover, we can see that over the past few trade days, the IBB ETF ha been consolid in a narrow rang right at (or margin above) those August and Septemb 2016 highs.At thi juncture, biotech' path of least resist on the daili chart - despit the bigger technic resist from the first chart abov - continu to point higher.Here' Whi GoPro Inc.

Why Intel Corporation Is Unlikely to Lose the Apple Inc. Mac Anytime Soon,3/6/2017,"Rumor are swirl that microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be on the verg of lose it spot as the supplier of the processor that powerApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products.Hypothes rang from Apple' design it own chip for the Mac to specul that Appl will use chip from altern processor vendors. However, I believ that base on Intel' recent commentari at it Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlik that the compani is go to lose these orders.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel' CCG financi guidanceIf Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor orders, thi would manifest as a reduct in the company' Client Comput Group (CCG) revenu and oper profits. If we estim that Appl pay an averag of $200 for Intel processor and relat components, then that' $4 billion in revenu that could potenti be at risk.Put anoth way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop significantly), then Intel could potenti see more than 10% of it CCG revenu vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world, but it' the sort of thing that would sting.At it investor day, Intel said that it expect it revenu in CCG to declin at a ""low-single-digits"" pace -- or an averag of 1%-3% annual over the next three years. If we compound the low and high end of that range, Intel is plan for between a 3% and a 9% declin in CCG revenu from 2016 level by the end of 2019.Here' a translat to hard dollar figures: Intel is plan for CCG revenu to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3 billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the midpoint.At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in hi investor meet present that he expect the PC processor total address market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2 billion down from where the compani peg the total address market in 2016.Put the number togetherIf Intel expect the PC processor total address market to drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is plan for ""low-single-digit"" declin in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion declin at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the compani is guid for signific personal-comput processor revenu share loss.Now, it' worth note that forecast thi long out aren't go to be perfect, but Intel like ha visibl into the personal-comput design win pipelin at it variou customers, includ Apple. If Appl were prepar to shift away from Intel processor for Mac releas over the next coupl of years, then Intel would like be awar of that immin shift and should have includ that expect in it multi-year forecast.Bas on thi analysis, I don't think Intel investor ought to worri too much about Apple' switch away from Intel processor anytim soon in it MacBook or iMac products.Ov the long term, however, anyth is possible, so Intel will have to make sure that it ha an increasingli compel product pipelin to keep Appl interested.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcom toIndustri Focus, the podcast that dive into a differ sector of the stock market everi day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so we'r talk about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and join me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extrem well. It' good to hear your voice. It' been awhile, a month or two, sinc we last had a podcast, and I miss you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it' been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-import question.Rosevear:What' the question?O'Reilly:You'r the onli guy I know who can answer thi for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it' veri tiring, I want to know when I'm go to get my self-driv car.Rosevear:Well, it depend on what you mean by get, and realli depend on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touch the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let' back up and defin some term here. Thi system of classif for thing that assist driver ha becom pretti universal. It wa develop by the Societi of Automot Engin in the U.S. The U.S. govern ha adopt it, other govern have adopt it, it' the way all automak talk now. They categor it in six level that are help number from zero to five. A level zero system, there' no automation, the driver doe everything. Thi might even includ warn system like lane departur warning. But, the driver actual ha to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assist that parallel park for you, that kind of stuff. That' a level one system.O'Reilly:Do that includ anti-lock brakes? I'm surpris that' on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Ey of the beholder?Rosevear:Th driver is still execut that. They count that as an intervent system. It' when the car decid to break for you that it start to becom assisted. These emerg stop system that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the level one through five requir some level of sens what' go on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park system where the car spin the wheel for you and back into the spot, that kind of thing, that' a level one. Level two is where it start to get interesting. Thi is the system where you'r on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, mayb the earliest version of Tesla' autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust it speed rel to the car around to you, and it will keep itself in it lane. It' do a littl steer and a littl acceler and deceler on it own. But there still ha to be a human driver, the human driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these system requir you to actual touch the wheel everi minut or two, or someth like that. Level three is when it kind of get into self driving. Thi is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, thi is where Tesla' autopilot is start to go, thi is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruis that will come out on Cadillac soon, thi is where it end up, level three.O'Reilly:Sup Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That' what they call it. That' what they'v been call it for a few years, I'm not complet sure that' what they'r go to call it when it come to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it' self-driv until suddenli it isn't, the driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. That make it a littl tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.O'Reilly:Th Motley Fool' Dan Spark did that articl about a year ago, he live out in Colorado and he ha a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touch the wheel on the freeway with that thing.Rosevear:Tesla' offici instruct with the origin system where you'r suppos to touch the wheel regularly, they consid it an advanc level two system. I think now they'r into level three territory. The border here is a littl bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is drive itself, period. It doe not need you, but it' limited. Usual what it mean is it' limit to an area that' been mapped, we say it' been geofenced. These system tend to depend on veri highli detail 3D map that show stuff that normal map don't show, like exactli where the curb is within a coupl inch and so forth, so the car can navig precisely, especi on a citi street. So, it' full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steer wheel, but it onli work where the car ha a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to thi in a minut -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherev you want under ani conditions. If it' snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.So, what we'r talk about in the near futur is level four, a car that will self-driv itself. Thi is come soon. But it' limit by it maps. The idea is, gradual the map will expand over time and you'll be abl to drive --O'Reilly:Ar there citi that are be map right now? I'm actual surpris to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is be mapped. Thi is where Uber is do their testing, a lot of it. Thi is actual where Ford' new compani they creat as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google' self-driv car project run it. Thi is basic Ford' softwar team for self-driving, and they'r in Pittsburgh. There' been a lot of map done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, becaus the artifici intellig lab at Carnegi Mellon is the sourc of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the peopl are there. There' some map go on in San Francisco. I know GM' cruis autom subsidiari is do test of level four assist in San Francisco, so they have map go on. Then, there are compani map all over the place. Tesla, I think, is autom some of thi map with the sensor on their exist cars. A compani calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) is go to start do map with sensor on their customers' cars, these are sensor for level two system but they can help do the map for level four. Thi is go to start veri soon, probabl next year for Mobileye. There are privat compani tri to do this, too, hope to be abl to sell the map to the automak or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in thi is, of course, Waymo. Google' been map for year and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You'v seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of camera on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That' how I can see what my dentist' offic look like from across the street. They'r map citi with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybodi is. And it' not just map for Googl Maps, it' map at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car know what to expect as it' driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from it sensors. If it' dark out, if it' foggy, if the lighter system is be buggi for whatev reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Becaus these are safeti systems, there ha to be redund built in. That' the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is thi stuff come out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantli doe these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolut for sure when they'll be readi to ship it. There' also an interest question there that with their owner of their current models, they'v been ship stuff that mayb ha some bug still in it for the owner to bang on. And becaus Tesla owner tend to be earli adopt types, they'r mostli cool with that. As Tesla move into the mass market with it upcom Model 3, someth els we'v talk about, I don't know if they'r go to tighten it up a littl bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, thi partnership of giant auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machin vision specialist that ha done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicli traded, right? For our listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, becaus if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that' as close as it gets. The third compani in thi isIntel, which is design the processors. They'r work togeth on a level four system. We'v talk about thi before. They will have thi avail to ani automak who want it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the car are go to ship in 2019. These thing are incorpor as the car are developed. So, probabl late 2020, earli 2021, peopl will be ship car with thi system in, but those car may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here' what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, ""We'r go to mass produc a level four vehicl start in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we'r not go to sell it at retail. Thi is go to be for car share use in citi and ride hail services, Lyft and Uber and so on."" It' becaus of the maps. They onli want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Field at Ford ha said, ""We'r not even go to give it a steer wheel in this,"" so obvious it ha to have the maps. Again, as the map expand, there'l be more. Ford is say right now that they think they'll have level four function in their retail vehicl 2025-ish. But they alway say that, Bill Ford, execut chairman of Ford, alway says, ""We throw out these dates, but it' alway earlier than I expect."" So, we'll see. Right now they'r say 2025. So, yeah, he says, ""Thi stuff move much faster than we expect."" There' also some other stuff go on. The thing to emphas here, I should back up a littl bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech compani talk about what they'r doing. There will be surpris here. Thi is just, what ha been announced, what we have seen, what we gener know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, onc you go public with someth you get held to it in some capacity, and nobodi want to get egg on their face.Rosevear:Right. And GM origin said they'd launch Super Cruis in 2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a differ name for that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They'r a level three system. They came out a while back and said, ""Wait a minute, we'r not happi with it, we'r go to do more work and make it more advanced. We'r not go to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probabl around there."" But again, they are not hold themselv to a firm date on that. In fact, they'r not hold themselv to a firm date on a lot of thi stuff. Mari Barra' thing is, ""We'll ship it when it' ready."" But what we do know is that GM is plan to actual start build a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedli in the thousands. These will be the electr Chevi Volts. They will be fit with prototyp level four systems, and they will go into thi massiv test with Lyft in sever differ cities. So, when will you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is whi they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it' someth like that. It' a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a drive car? If you'r in D.C., you might get one in sever month from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphon and a Chevi Volt comes. Uber is alreadi do thi on a tini scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 car or someth that are prototyp self-driv vehicl in their fleet. With these things, there are two engin on board. One is readi to grab the wheel and the other one is take note on everyth that' happen with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driv vehicles. So it might not seem all that excit becaus there' somebodi in the front seat, but the car is drive itself, is the idea. Thi is a way to rack up a whole lot of test mile quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these thing out there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless car handl all the roundabout in D.C., that'll be a treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotari up here in New England, we have lot of them too. It'll be interest to see how they handl Boston, which is coloni era street in some area of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they'r made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definit not driverless cars. But, there' other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiari that use to be the Googl Self-Driv Car Project and ha now been set up as a compani to go into busi and commerci thi in some way. Who will partner with them? They had thi littl deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivan as test vehicl that took on their latest prototyp system. They'v been talk toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there' a certain view in the auto industri that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil becaus Googl will want all the data. And then you'r an Android phone maker, and Google' make all the money. That is a great fear. I think everi auto CEO in the world is mind of the exampl of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actual a lot of the sell proposit of the Delphi-Mobiley system, thi is a system develop within the establish auto industri supplier structure. We'll share the map among our fellow automak and so forth, but we'r not sell the data to Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think ha been go on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Googl ha those tini littl white go-kart look driverless car for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them tri to make a buck off of them at all. It' weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and execut name John Krafcik. He had been the presid ofTrueCar, and befor that, he had been in the busi for years. He wa with sever automakers, in manag capacities, execut capacities. He' a guy who know the business, a good guy, smart guy. Hi job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring thi stuff to market somehow. He' been out there talk to automakers. He actual did a realli big present at the North American Intern Auto Show in Detroit in Januari -- I wa go to say last month, but it' March now. He wa talk about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototyp level four system. I think he wa there, in part, fish for automak who might want to have conversation. It' possibl those convers have happen and nobodi is talk about them. The one that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, becaus the latest test vehicl are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:W don't have thi as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listen are on the tip of their tongu with this, they want to hear, what is Appl up to? They have that big plan, and I'v got a push notif fromTh Wall Street Journala year ago that Appl wa go to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pull back on it, they'r do test again. What is Tim Cook scheme right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I rememb when thatWal Street Journalth came out.O'Reilly:Y got the notif too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actual poke a few sourc and end up write a big piec for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morn after that broke, sort of, what doe thi mean, can they actual do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Appl ha so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I rememb you talk about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it' about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factori and they'r bang out car and it' realli high level of qualiti and so forth. Full boat. That' Tim Cook' lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margin in the car business, by Apple' standards, are pretti lousy. A luxuri car busi might make an oper margin of 10-12%. If you'r Porsche, you might make 16%. That' kind of the upper limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possibl that Googl and Appl wind up drop the brain in these car and call it a day? Googl already, they must have ton of data on these car operating.Rosevear:Googl ha made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, ""We'r not build cars, we'r not go to build a car factory, we are not build cars. We'r look for partnerships, we are not build cars."" Appl hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, thi program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the peopl who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the busi have been let go. Peopl work on electr self-driv car are in veri hot demand these days. So, none of these peopl are want for employment. But it wa thought that a lot of those folk were let go, and they realli ratchet down the ambit of the program. They may be aim to do someth where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple- a self drive car built by somebodi else. It' possibl that they will find an automak to partner with, and mayb offer that as a delux ride hail option. My thought when they were origin talk about thi wa that they were go to build the delux Appl version of robot Uber, where it' a littl bit more money but it' a nicer car, and it recogn all your Appl devic and it' thi seamless experience, it see your iPhon and it automat set your seat and your climat and your music and everyth els and all thi stuff, it take exactli where you want to go, and it' just a subscript model, $500 a month for the Appl Car service. That' where I thought they were go to go. Other disagreed. Some of my fellow Fool who are also veri close watcher of thi kind of technolog and particularli close watcher of Appl thought they might actual build a car for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We'r about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magic go to get my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it' probabl a few year beyond that. Somebodi may surpris us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that ha a fairli big map. But I'm think it might be over the next coupl year after that that these start to be avail for retail. I suspect the first one that come out, it will be an expens option on a luxuri car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, onc again, for your time.Rosevear:It' alway a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagin that as thi continu to ramp up, thi will not be our last show about thi topic.Rosevear:Oh, heaven no. We'll be talk about thi for sever year to come. It' a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again!Rosevear:Al right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye. That' it for us, folks.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?,3/6/2017,"Mobil chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chines smartphon giantXiaomiar often consid close partners. Qualcomm becam one of Xiaomi' earliest investor in 2011, and all of Xiaomi' flagship devic use Qualcomm chips. When regulatori troubl in China forc Qualcomm to renegoti it licens term with OEMs, Xiaomi wa one of the first compani tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that allianc gradual weakened. Xiaomi eventu start use moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chip in it cheaper devices, and ongo rumor indic that the compani wa develop first-parti chips. Those rumor were final confirm in late February, when Xiaomi unveil the Surg S1 chip for it new mid-rang Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi' Mi5c. Imag source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();Th Surg S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which run at 2.2GHz with anoth four run at 1.4GHz. It Mali T-860 MP4 GPU is capabl of play 4K videos. Those spec make it slightli more power than Qualcomm' Snapdragon 625, a popular octa-cor processor which power mid-rang devic like the intern variant of Xiaomi' Mi Note 4. The S1 wa produc by Xiaomi' subsidiari Pinecon Electron via a partnership with Chines chipmakerLeadcore.Whi Xiaomi need to make it own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi becam the biggest smartphon maker in China. But by the end of 2016, it had drop to fifth place afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That declin wa caus by competitor flood the market with compar price phones, a shift in consum tast toward pricier devices, and an overal slowdown across the Chines smartphon market.Last November, Xiaomi admit that it core phone busi wasn't profitable. In January, it stop disclos annual shipment figur and abruptli announc that it would skip thi year' Mobil World Congress. Those move all indic that the compani wa struggl to stay afloat in the crowd Chines market.However, Xiaomi also notic that it could follow Apple, Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-parti ARM chips. Produc first-parti chip is a pricey investment, but it' a smart long-term play becaus it reduc Xiaomi' depend on chipmak like Qualcomm, cut product costs, tighten up the suppli chain, and give it full control over the hardwar and the softwar -- which could better optim it devic for Xiaomi' MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi' Mi Air Purifier. Imag source: Xiaomi.In addit to lower cost and boost performance, IDC analyst Bryan Ma also note that Xiaomi' first-parti chip could work better with it smart home ecosystem, which alreadi includ air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers. Xiaomi could also use it first-parti chip to bypass a ban on MediaTek chip in India, which occur due to a patent disput withEricsson.What thi mean for QualcommXiaomi' introduct of first-parti chip isn't good news for Qualcomm, but there' no indic that Xiaomi will stop use Qualcomm chip altogether. The Mi 5c mere repres the budget devic of it flagship Mi 5 famili -- which includ the origin Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5 devic use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surg S1 could actual hurt MediaTek -- which suppli Xiaomi with chip for variant of it low and mid-rang devic -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surg S1 becom Xiaomi' offici mid-rang chipset, it could stop use MediaTek chip as Qualcomm chip remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm' Snapdragon could lose it spot in mid-rang devic like the Mi Note 4, but the overal impact on it chipmak busi might be minimal. Xiaomi' global market share is alreadi like below 5%, base on IDC estimates, and could continu fade as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices. SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devic use Qualcomm chips, higher sale at those lead brand could easili offset ani design loss at Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investor be worried?If Xiaomi had reveal the Surg S1 back in 2014, then swap out all Qualcomm chip with it own silicon, I think investor would have been worried. But Xiaomi is mere aim it new chip at the mid-rang market today, and ani loss from Xiaomi could probabl be offset by higher sale of other rival Android devices.Therefore, investor shouldn't consid Xiaomi' announc to be a major blow to Qualcomm on it own. Nonetheless, the overal trend is worrisome, becaus it indic that Qualcomm' chipmak busi -- which post flat year-over-year sale growth last quarter -- will like continu cede market share to first-parti ARM chip for the forese future.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",3/6/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh collaps ofBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) ha been stunning. But in the tech world, such thing do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRi stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it' amaz that the compani ha been abl to recov from have to deal with the onslaught of mega oper likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let' face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up success fight. Thi wa certainli a major reason whi CEO Steve Ballmer step aside.But surviv is not enough, of course. So it should be no surpris that - for the past five year - BBRi stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, thi wa the sentiment for say,Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stock That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gaug the potenti opportun of BlackBerri stock, let' take a look at three pro and cons:3 Pro On BBRi StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which wa struggl againstOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructur the oper and redirect the compani toward enterpris mobil and commerce. He would ultim sell Sybas toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefti $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also ha strongtechn chops. Consid that he ha a master' in electr engin from California Institut of Technology. He also got hi first job as an engin withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transit a compani from hardwar to softwar is no easi feat. But Chen ha definit made lot of progress with thi strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenu from Softwar & Servic came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% wa recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterpris custom order in the quarter.For Chen, he ha made some savvi acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And anoth import part of the strategi ha been to outsourc phone development. Thi ha meant fewer distract as well as the opportun to pick-up high-margin licens revenues.Someth else: Chen ha done a good job in leverag some of the long-tim core technolog assets. An exampl of thi is BlackBerri Secure, which is a full-blown suit of mobil enterpris apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRi is tri to posit itself to get a share of the embed technolog market, which is see tremend growth from the auto sector. Note that the compani ha BlackBerri QNX, which is a softwar develop platform that provid top-notch secur featur and ha been award the ISO 26262 ASIL D certif for cars. The system is optim to support lead vendor likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.A a testament to the advantag of QNX, BBRi recent sign an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Con On BBRi StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRi wa the global leader in the fast-grow smartphon market. But the iPhon would quickli end thi dominance. What' more, BBRi made plenti of blunders, such as in term of aw launches.Th result is that the BlackBerri brand is fairli tarnished. Granted, thi mani not seem to matter as much sinc the compani ha move away from the consum market. However, the brand could still be a problem with busi custom as well. Whi use technolog from a compani that seem to have a dicey future?Competition: It' intense. When it come to the secur market, there are mani player that have great offer likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Softwar Technolog Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterpris mobil solut also ha mani tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY' offer in the messag categori also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT' Skype, AAPL' iMessag and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRi seem to be good buyout bait. The company' cost structur ha been streamlined, there are strong technolog asset and a larg custom base.Yet Accord toInvestorPlace.com' Richard Saintvilus: ""It ha becom clear that Chen - who wa brought in to build BlackBerri into an M&A target - ha taken thi compani as far as he can take it. Despit all of the boast the compani ha done about it superior secur capabilities, BBRi stock ha had no M&A suitors, suggest compani likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracl Corpor and other enterprise-focus compani with which BlackBerri ha often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRi StockAgain, Chen ha done a great job. Let' face it, BBRi wa a complet mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsH wast littl time with cost cut and outsourc of the phone business. More importantly, he ha invest in area like security, embed system and even the Internet of Thing (IoT).However, despit all this, the fact remain that progress ha been grudging. If anything, it will probabl still take some time - say a year or so - for the chang to have a real impact. In other words, for those look at BBRi stock, it' probabl best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

But last December, Fitbit abruptli drop a key ITC lawsuit against Jawbone, claim that a victori would be worthless becaus Jawbon wa teeter on the brink of bankruptcy.4. Whi Applereallyboot it from it storesA competit from Jawbon faded, a bigger threat emerg whenApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduc the Appl Watch in late 2014. Shortli after the announcement, Appl stop sell Fitbit devic at it brick-and-mortar and onlin stores.Imag source: Apple.Mani consum probabl think that Appl did that to reduc direct competit for the Appl Watch, but that wa onli partli true. The main reason wa actual Fitbit' refus to sync it devic to Apple' HealthKit platform, which pull data from multipl devic and app to a unifi dashboard -- similar to Googl Fit. Fitbit want to grow it own digit ecosystem without Appl pull away it users, but the decis greatli reduc it exposur to Apple' customers.5.

Interesting December Stock Options for AAPL,3/6/2017,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Appl Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So thi week we highlight one interest put contract, and one interest call contract, from the Decemb expir for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $115 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of $3.05. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 2.6% return against the $115 commitment, or a 3.4% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to AAPL' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Appl Inc see it share fall 17.1% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $111.95 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the $3.05 from $115), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 3.4% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annual 3.4% figur actual exce the 1.6% annual dividend paid by Appl Inc by 1.8%, base on the current share price of $138.73. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to fall 17.11% to reach the $115 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Appl Inc, look at the dividend histori chart for AAPL below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 1.6% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the Decemb expiration, for sharehold of Appl Inc (Symbol: AAPL) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 1.6% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $160 strike and collect the premium base on the $3.40 bid, annual to an addit 3.1% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 4.8% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $160 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but AAPL share would have to advanc 15.3% from current level for that to happen, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 17.8% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Appl Inc, highlight in green where the $115 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $160 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Decemb put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

UAA stock is down by about half, and the company' struggl have been well-documented.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockInvestor had insan high expect for Under Armour stock, and analyst set their earn target accordingly. That had the natur and unfortun effect of investor flee each time these expect weren't met.Th biggest carnag ha come over the past coupl quarters. In it recent report Q4, Under Armour' revenu of $1.31 billion and profit of 23 cent per share fell under estim for $1.41 billion and 25 cents, respectively. The company' Q3 wa better - UAA beat analyst expect on the top and bottom line - the day wa mar by CEO Kevin Plank tell investor growth wa to be less than anticip go forward.Whil growth investor have been dump UAA stock, though, valu investor have start snif around.So the question now is: Are Under Armour share a bargain, or just cheap?Th Valu Case For (And Against) Under Armour StockUnd Armour isn't a great valu on mani of the tradit metrics, with share trade at nearli 50 time earnings. The forward P/E of roughli 40 isn't anyth to get excit about either, with earn expect to declin slightli in 2017. UAA isn't a bargain on the basi of price-to-book or price-to-cash flow, either.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Buy in MarchW have to look a littl further out for Under Armour stock to be a plausibl valu investment.UAA laid out plan back in March 2016 to grow the top line about 20% a year to reach $10 billion in sale by 2020. While that growth rate look to be in jeopardy, the compani is still post some impress growth. Sale grew by 21% in 2016, with analyst project revenu to increas by 11% in 2017 and 15% in 2018.Under Armour also will see a nice uptick in the top line in 2020, when the sport apparel makertak over Major Leagu Baseball' uniform contract fromMajestic. That deal could kick in sooner if Majest decid to opt out of it current deal befor the deadline.So while UAA stock doesn't have a cheap P/E, and it like won't for a veri long time, if we factor in the company' strong growth potential, we can at least argu that earn will someday grow enough that you could consid Under Armour a bargain today.Let' assum the bottom line will grow by 20% a year after 2017. Thi is not an unreason assumpt becaus Under Armour stock such a high impli revenu growth rate, and as it get bigger, it' easier to wring out ineffici that crimp the bottom line. There will like be a greater emphasi on profit go forward as well, rather than revenue.Earn are expect to be 42 cent per share in 2017. If UAA' bottom line grow by 20% a year, the compani will post earn of 73 cent per share in 2020 and $1.81 per share in 2025. If investor then valu Under Armour stock at today' P/E ratio of 49, share have an impli valu of $35.77 in 2020 and $88.69 in 2025.The issu is, of course, will the market continu to valu UAA stock at such a high premium?Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Go to Frustrat YouIf Under Armour can post great results, growth investor will flock back to it. If it struggles, more impati investor will like leave, drive down the valuat further.Th Bottom Line on UAA StockIt' hard to consid Under Armour stock a valu investment. The compani ha to post outstand profit growth for a number of year while continu to get a premium multiple. That' hard to do.Ther are still multipl way an invest in UAA stock could still work out, however.Thecompani could have a few nice quarters, and investor could bump it inflat P/E ratio even higher.

"Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Microsoft",3/6/2017,"They'r two of the five largest publicli trade compani in the world. They'r technolog giant that are increasingli compet against one anoth in multibillion-dollar growth industri such as cloud comput and artifici intelligence. They'reAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .And they'r vastli differ compani in term of their core oper focuses, their recent histories, and their cultures. So which is the better buy today? Let' examin Amazon.com and Microsoft through three analyt lenses, to determin which tech stalwart repres the better stock to buy today.Financi fortitudeThough both compani are financi behemoths, Microsoft beat Amazon in thi comparison of financi fortitude. Here' a quick summari of sever import liquid and solvenc measur for each company.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioMicrosoft$122.7 billion$84.9 billion$36.7 billion2.1Amazon.com$25.9 billion$7.7 billion$16.4 billion1.0Data sources: Amazon.com and Microsoft investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.Microsoft and Amazon are in fine financi shape. However, even though Microsoft carri more debt than Amazon, it earn a win in thi categori by beat the world' largest e-commerc provid in three categories. Plus, onli $600 million of Microsoft' borrow will come due thi calendar year. The overwhelm major of Microsoft' debt come due after 2020, and then at veri low interest rates. Given the company' cash flow gener capabilities, servic that debt should be no issu for Microsoft.It also bear note that Microsoft, likeApple, keep the bulk of it cash hold oversea to shield it from repatri taxes. In it most recent 10-Q, the compani didn't disclos how much cash lie offshore, but it annual 10-K file show that it kept approxim 96% overseas. But sinc it gener plenti of oper cash flow to fund it domest and intern operations, thi is realli a non-issu for investors.Winner: Microsoft.Dur competit advantagesMicrosoft and Amazon.com each enjoy competit advantages, albeit of differ sorts. Amazon' primari moat are it scale and risk-tak culture. At thi point, Microsoft' competit insul seem more structur and historic. Let' unpack each of those a bit more.Amazon gener the bulk of it sale from it core e-commerc operations, account for 91% of revenu in 2016. As the world' largest e-commerc site by revenue, Amazon ha an incred scale that allow it to consist offer low prices. More impress still, Amazon' uniqu abil to turn it own platform into sourc of revenu -- think Amazon Web Services,Fulfil by Amazon, third-parti ad on Amazon.com, and so on -- allow it to charg the lowest price possibl on it e-commerc site, which in turn attract more customers. Thi self-regener busi philosophi is best summar in the idea of theFlywheel Effect, which is at the core of Amazon' strategi and touch on it uniqu culture.Imag Source: Amazon.comTo creat a cultur that could invent profit center to buoy it low- or even negative-margin e-commerc sales, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo and hi team need to creat a cultur where risk-tak and unconvent think were the norm. Bezo summar risk-taking' foundat place in Amazon' cultur in the 2015 annual letter:A word about corpor cultures: For better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change. ... One area where I think we are especi distinct is failure. I believ we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenti of practice!), and failur and invent are insepar twins.Without it uniqu corpor mindset, Amazon never would have had the audaci and vision to launch mani of it most import initiatives, make it cultur arguabl it most import asset and sourc of endur competit advantage.Microsoft' sourc of competit advantage, on the other hand, can be summar in one word: ""Office."" It remain Microsoft' financi heart and soul and is the largest revenu sourc at the company, singlehandedli account for $23.5 billion, or 27%, of Microsoft' $85.3 billion in sale in fiscal 2016.CEO Satya Nadella' 2015-16 reorgan of Microsoft' oper creat three new report segments: product and busi process (PBP), intellig cloud, and more person computing. PBP hous the consum and commerci Offic operations, as well as Microsoft' Dynam CRM platform. The entir segment gener $26.5 billion of Microsoft' total sales, so we know, use the Offic revenu figure, that Offic drive the segment' performance.It import come into greater focu when look at Microsoft' operating-profit breakdown. PBP -- again, mostli Offic -- gener $12.4 billion, or 62%, of Microsoft' $20.1 billion in fiscal 2016 oper income, make it the financi bellweth that guid Microsoft' financi performance.Oth segments, particularli Intellig Cloud, have becom increasingli import piec of Microsoft' financi footprint as well. However, Microsoft' core competit advantag still lie in the fact that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint make up the default product softwar for the major of world' computer-us population, and that' a sourc of tremend advantag -- and profit -- for the company.Winner: Tie.ValuationCompar the valuat of Microsoft and Amazon isn't the simplest exercise, given their differ growth profiles. With that in mind, here are three of the most commonli use valuat metric for each company.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAMicrosoft30.219.716.8Amazon.com173.766.134.1EV = ENTERPRIS VALUE. EBITDA = EARN BEFOR INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Her we get a great comparison of two invest style -- growth versu value. Neither come out ahead here. More conserv investor who prefer to own stock with someth of a margin of safeti will probabl be drawn to Microsoft, with it more conserv valuat and 2.3% dividend yield. Of course, those same investor have alway argu that Amazon is overvalued, even as the company' stock ascend ever higher.From the perspect of a long-term investor, I believ Amazon' abil to grow at above-averag rate for years, if not decad to come, will enabl it to grow into and beyond it current valuation. Microsoft' main issue, meanwhile, remain it growth outlook.Thi analysi is somewhat subjective. More risk-avers investors, particularli those near retirement, might want to stay away from Amazon stock. However, for those with the abil to buy and hold a compani for a decad or more, I like Amazon despit it aggress valuat today.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... Amazon, by a noseBoth Amazon and Microsoft offer investor attract invest opportunities, in veri differ ways. As I mentioned, Microsoft is probabl a better option for more risk-avers investors.

How Apple Could Spend Its Cash Hoard,3/6/2017,"The problem ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) cash balanc is a ""first-world problem"" in the most liter sens of the phrase.Slightli larger than the annual econom output of Chile, Apple' cash and market secur stockpil lie larg overseas. As of the company' most recent earn report, $230 billion of Apple' $246 billion, roughli 93%, wa held in account control by Apple' intern subsidiaries.Appl ha caus quit a stir thank to it controversi decis to park it foreign profit abroad rather than pay what it argu are oner and unfair repatri taxes. However, the whiff of tax polici overhaul percol on Capitol Hill mean thi dynam could soon change. In anticip of such a scenario -- and in part becaus it' just fun to consid -- here are three realist way Appl could deploy it billion in the bank in the year ahead.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Apple.Idea 1: Major acquisitionAppl be a matur company, you often see investor float the idea of the Mac maker use it cash to fund a major acquisit whenev thi discuss appears. The idea isn't without merit, either, although it is more complex than it might seem on the surfac for a few reasons.Th first hurdl lie in correctli identifi a larg compani that jive with Apple' plan for it own future. In term of compani that I (subjectively) think could conceiv pair well with Apple, onli a hand of plausibl candid come to mind. Among them areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , andComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NASDAQ: CMCSK), three legitim viabl option among publicli trade companies.W know Appl is interest in -- or possibl in the midst of --develop an electr vehiclefrom the mani leak about it Project Titan, though we don't know much more than that. Tesla make the most sens among automak for a few reasons. Much like Apple, Tesla' mission is to fundament alter the industri in which it operates. It headquart in California would make work togeth simpler than coordin across the countri with Detroit.In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple' long-held desir to launch it own content stream service. Apple' abil to secur content right from major produc ha been the main thorn in it side. Both Netflix and Comcast control consider content rights, though Netflix is newer to thi game. As such, own either Comcast or Netflix could suppli Appl with the negoti leverag it need to final bring the requir parti to the table.Unfortunately, acquir ani of these compani would requir Appl pay a signific premium to their current prices, which could be particularli troubl for already-expens stock like Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and regulatori consider that could make such a maneuv highli complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entir without merit.Idea 2: More capit return?Thi come from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school of thought sinc Appl ha thu far use it cash reserv to financ it dividend and share buybacks. To do so, Appl ha cleverli use it oversea rich as collater to borrow against to fund it massiv capit return programto great effect.Appl ha paid out a whop $201 billion of it current $250 billion capit return program as of it most recent earn report, includ $15 billion in dividend and buyback in it latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Appl gener $27 billion in oper cash flow last year, and it capex requir are minim -- $3 billion last quarter. Thi make the statu quo seem sustainable, although the recent ralli inAppl stockmak thi option increasingli less appealing.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Stock buyback becom less effect as a company'svalu increases, so Apple' dramat multipl expans ha made thi tactic less attract than it wa a year ago. However, with Appl still trade at a discount to the market, and it cash balanc rising, there' certainli a fair case to be made that further buyback and dividend remain a worthi use of Apple' riches.Idea 3: Financ import capex?If Project Titan is inde real, I think the chanc of Appl implement thi third idea are quit strong. One of the most import question Appl must answer along the way is how will it manufactur the electr vehicle?A I havenotedin the past, automobil manufactur is a capital-intensive, low-margin business. Thi leav Appl face a potenti catch-22 with Project Titan, drive meaning sale growth while also dramat erod it now-cushi profit margin in the process.Perhap the best solut to thi problem is to follow a tactic similar to Apple' contract manufactur arrang with Asian assembl specialistsFoxconn. Appl design product and maintain qualiti control, but it hand over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the process, to someon else. Thi is how the major of Apple' consum electron get made today.Th key speed bump with thi idea is that there are no large-scal automot contract manufactur that exist today to provid thi servic to Apple, and that' where Apple' mountain of money come into play. Assum it find a will and capabl partner to build Project Titan, Appl could use it cash to financ the construct of the factori infrastructur necessari to bring Project Titan to life.In fact, Appl ha pursu a similar strategi in the past. It partner with the now-defunct GT Advanc Technolog to financ the construct of a factori that GT Advanc plan to use to produc commerci sapphir for Apple' fingerprint scanners. If it doe so, Appl will want to take great care to avoid past mistakes, like bankrupt GT Advanc under the oner term of it financ deal. Regardless, thi idea is sound as long as Apple' auto ambit are inde as real as portray in the media.Cash is kingOf course, thi onli scratch the surfac in term of possibl use of Apple' cash. U.S. tax polici overhaul will also have a signific influenc on Apple' options, so interest investor will want to stay in tune with the nation discuss around it in the come months. At the end of the day, though, Apple' billion in the bank provid it with unparallel flexibl to pursu ani number of possibl actions, and that' someth in which Appl investor can and should find great comfort.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying in 2017,3/5/2017,"Warren Buffett is arguabl the greatest investor of our time, and that make know what stock he' buy forBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) must-know news. In the fourth quarter, Buffett ad a bunch ofAppl Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) andDelta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) to hi portfolio, and recently, he told CNBC that he' spent about $20 billion of Berkshir Hathaway' cash stockpil buy these and other stock sinc ""a littl befor the election."" He also reveal that hi posit in both Appl and airlin stock is bigger now than it wa in December.Profit by the bushelAft consum opt to hold off on upgrad their iPhones, Appl share stumbl earli in 2016, and that prove to be the perfect opportun for Berkshir Hathaway portfolio manag Todd Comb and Ted Weschler to pick up share of the electron giant at a discount.IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.makeArticleAd();Berkshir Hathaway invest $1 billion inAppl stockin the first quarter of 2016 -- a fairli modest stake for a portfolio with $150 billion under management. However, that stake climb significantli throughout the remaind of the year, and exit December, Berkshir Hathaway' Appl posit wa worth about $7.7 billion, make it Buffett' sixth biggest individu stock position.Thi week, Buffett appear on CNBC to discuss Berkshir Hathaway' perform last year, and in hi conversation, he let it slip that hi interest in Appl continu into thi year. Although Appl wa alreadi a big hold enter thi year, Buffett say he now own 133 million share in Apple, make it hi second biggest holding.Apple' share have ralli sharpli sinc they first show up in Buffett' portfolio, so it' safe to assum that Berkshir Hathaway is sit on a nice gain on Apple' stock. He remind CNBC viewer he could sell at ani point, but I think there' reason to think he'll hold on to hi Appl posit for a while.Last quarter, iPhone, Mac, Appl Watch, and servic sale all reach record highs, and as a result, Apple' revenu and profit finish 2016 on a high note. Revenu in it fiscal first quarter wa a record $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion last year, and earn per share were $3.36, up from $3.28 a year ago. Apple' manag is guid investor to expect between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion in sale thi quarter, up between 1.7% and 5.7% year over year.With oper cash flow of $27 billion allow manag to return $15 billion to investor last year through share buyback and dividend payments, and busi hum along nicely, it wouldn't be surpris if Appl return even more money to investor thi year.Grow exposur to airlinesWhen it come to reward investor with market-b returns, airlin have a rocki history. However, an industrywid restructur a few year ago is boost profit, and that' make airlin some of the market' top performers. If the U.S. economi continu to strengthen, then fuller flight will help keep price firm, and invest in fuel-effici airplan will drop even more money to the bottom line.IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.In the past, Buffett ha said that one way to becom a millionair is to start out as a billionair and then invest in an airline. He doesn't seem to believ that anymore. Over the past six months, he' invest billion of Berkshir Hathaway' cash into the stock of the country' largest airlin operators.A of December, Berkshir Hathaway own 60 million share in Delta Air Line worth roughli $3 billion, plu he own about $2.5 billion inSouthwest Airlines, and about $2.1 billion in each ofAmerican AirlinesandUnit Continent Holdings. Overall, Buffett' Berkshir Hathaway ha invest over $9 billion in airlines.Although he didn't say exactli what airlin he' ad more to in 2017, he didn't deni that he' continu to increas hi bet on the industry. When he wa ask if he' spend more money on Appleandairlin thi year, he said that wa a ""good guess.""Clearly, he think airlin stock are go to go up, not down, and with unemploy low and incom rising, it' not a stretch to to think that airlin like Delta will continu to fill seats. If so, these compani could reward investor with bigger profit and, in turn, higher dividend payments.For instance, Delta Air Lines' goal is to return about 70% of it annual free cash flow to investors, and while a lot of that cash flow could be use for share buybacks, a low dividend payout ratio and cash dividend payout ratio suggest there' room to increas quarterli dividend payments, too.Currently, Delta Air Lines' dividend payout ratio -- or the percentag of earn paid to sharehold in dividend -- is less than 12%. American Airlin and Southwest' ratio are even lower. That' pretti low when you consid that other big compani are pay out far more to investors. For example,Gener Electric' payout ratio is 75%.With Warren Buffett own a big and potenti grow posit in airlines, and an opportun for investor to pocket bigger dividend payments, it might be time to buy stock in these companies.10 stock we like better than Delta Air LinesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Worst Performing Stocks in February,3/5/2017,"For a month in which the Dow Jone Industri Averag regularli set new high and close in on the 21,000 level, Februari also featur a surpris number of stock whose perform downright stunk.I ran a screen to identifi the worst stock from the S&P 500 in February. The bottom three perform wereSouthwestern Energy(NYSE: SWN) ,Fossil Group(NASDAQ: FOSL) , andUnd Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) . Let' see whi they suck as bad as they did, and consid what it would take to turn those declin around in the near term -- if they can.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Southwestern Energy: Down 22.3%Sure, a few part of the countri were hit with winter storm that dump some snow accumul on them, but larg swath of the U.S. were bask in unseason warm temperatur last month. The mild weather ha depressednatur ga prices; the Energi Inform Administr said Henri Hub spot price fell from $2.92 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.53 per MMBtu in the most current weekli report. And though net withdraw are some 7% abov the five-year averag for thi time of year, they remain 10% below the year-ago average.That make it difficult for a natur ga and oil driller like Southwestern Energi to profit produc energy, and the company' fourth quarter earn result last week justifi whi it share price have larg been trend down sinc October. Even though it wa abl to turn a loss a year ago into a profit of $0.08 per share thi time around, itwid missedanalysts' consensu expect of $0.12 per share.Despit the depress price environment, Southwestern and other driller insist they will keep on pump out more supply. Indeed, the EIA expect total product from the seven shale region of the U.S. to reach an all-tim high of 48.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in February, to be follow by a new record of 49.1 Bcf/d in March.That doesn't bode well for profit price in the future, but Southwestern Energi ha improv it balanc sheet sinc last year, put it in better shape financially. It still might be difficult, though, for it to shake off it troubl anytim soon, consid the spring fever that now look like to consum the rest of thi winter.Imag source: Fossil.Fossil Group: Down 23%The weather map might be show warmer temps, but it' been downright chilli for watchmak Fossil Group, which ha lost nearli a quarter of it valu in Februari alone, and is down by more than 60% from the high it hit back in November. The problem is not so mani peopl wear tradit timepiec anymore, so sale in that segment are fall at a faster rate than could be compens for by ani potenti pickup in new, so-cal smart watches.Though itbeat analysts' expectationsfor the fourth quarter, it outlook for the come year wa brutal -- henc the frosti recept it report got from the market. It' anticip it sale in 2017 will at best be flat compar to 2016, but warn they could fall as much as 6.5%. Worse, Fossil at the bottom of it forecast rang could produc a loss of as much as $0.50 per share, though if it most optimist scenario play out, it might be abl to earn a profit of $0.20 a share. That kind of a wide forecast -- big enough to drive a truck through -- indic that not even manag understand it industri all that well.Thes are chang times, and Fossil' choic to hitch it wagon to the smartwatch hors may not pay off as expected. Accord to the market research at IDC, total smartwatch sale volum plung 51.6% in 2016' third quarter, fall to 2.7 million unit ship from the 5.6 million unit ship in the prior year.

What Will Warren Buffett Buy Next With His $86 Billion War Chest?,3/4/2017,"Accord toBerkshir Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) latest annual report, Warren Buffett and hi team are sit on an $86 billion stockpil of cash. While the Oracl of Omaha like to keep at least $20 billion in cash or equival on the sidelin at all times, thi still leav a lot of money just wait to be put to work. We have no way of know exactli what Berkshir will buy next, but we do know what the compani is look for.Berkshire' cash hoard is differ than most othersBerkshir Hathaway is not the onli compani with a massiv cash hoard, and it is certainli not the biggest. The tech sector in particular ha sever player with big stockpil of cash, such asApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Microsoft,Alphabet,Cisco, andOracle.Imag Source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();However, these compani have most their cash stash overseas, and can't bring it back without face a larg tax bill. In fact, Moody' estim that about 87% of these five tech giants' cash is stash overseas.Berkshir Hathaway, on the other hand, doesn't have thi problem to worri about. 95% of Berkshire' $86 billion stockpil of cash is held by U.S. entities. And, the remain 5% would trigger big repatri taxes, as most of it wa earn in compani that impos big corpor taxes, which would be use to offset U.S. tax upon repatri of the cash.In a nutshell, not onli doe Berkshir have $86 billion in cash, but thi is cash that can actual be use without major tax consequences.How Berkshir Hathaway choos it acquisit targetsTh exact process Warren Buffett and hi team use to evalu potenti acquisit target is a close guard secret. However, Berkshir Hathaway doe activ encourag prospect acquisit to contact the company, so long as the busi meet six criteria:Th busi must be large. Berkshir defin thi as have at least $75 million of pre-tax earn per year. The compani will make an except if it can fit into one of it exist busi units.Th compani must be abl to demonstr that it is consist profitable. Buffett and hi team have no interest in invest in unprofit compani or compani that may or may not becom profitable.Th busi must have littl or no debt and still produc good return on equity.Ther must alreadi be manag in place. I'd add to thi and say that there must begood manag in place. I can't emphas enough the valu Buffett place on good managers.Th busi must be simple. Buffett doesn't invest in tech compani or biotech or anyth els that he doesn't understand.Ther must be an offer price on the table, even if it' just preliminary.Berkshire' target acquisit rang is $5 to $20 billion. Thi is not a set-in-ston rule, as the compani ha certainli made except in the past. However, the larger the compani the greater Berkshire' interest will be.It would be foolish to specul as to which exact compani Buffett and hi team may buy next. However, it is fair to say that wa such a larg stockpil of cash, Brookshir will be on the prowl for an acquisit that meet it criteria.Or, will Buffett and compani buy more stock instead?In addit to it fulli own businesses, Berkshir Hathaway ha a stock portfolio consist of about 45 differ compani as of thi writing. The stock that Warren Buffett is buy and sell are close follow by million of investors.W alreadi know for a fact that some of Berkshire' cash hoard is be spent on common stock in 2017. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett reveal that sinc the start of the year, Berkshir ha more than doubl it stake in Apple,and now own about 2.5% of the tech giant.Just like with Berkshire' acquisit of entir companies, it would be silli to specul on what stock Buffett and hi team will buy next, but the reason behind the Appl invest are a good exampl of what he look for.Buffett said that he decid to boost Berkshire' Appl stake becaus of the company' consumer-retain power. After all, peopl who use iPhon typic upgrad to a newer model of the same product -- over and over. Buffett also prais CEO Tim Cook' capit deploy strategies. In addition, Appl trade for a rel low valuat when compar with the rest of the market, and look cheaper still if you account for the company' massiv stockpil of cash.What it mean to youA I'v mention before, it would be silli to tri to figur out what compani are stock Berkshir Hathaway will buy next.

Accord to independ metric fromMarket and Markets, cloud storag is a $24 billion market today -- and expect to reach annual sale of $75 billion in just five years.In other words, it look like Appl is leav a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storag servic is not pull it weight, or move the needl for Apple. Instead, consum with a need for off-sit file-storag tool prefer free servic like Brand Keys' categori winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known option such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-plac finisherGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.Appl is not onli miss a signific market opportunity, but leav a lot of that cash for Googl parent Alphabet to grab instead.Appl CEO Tim Cook. Imag source: Apple.Whi is Appl miss the boat?Apple' iCloud is, in mani ways, veri similar to Googl Drive and Dropbox. All three servic allow user to store nearli ani type of file in a central manag cloud server, access from ani network computer. They all come with small storag limit for a free account, all offer a terabyt of storag for $9.99 per month, and come with variou tool for manag your store files. But Appl doe a few thing differently.First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, sign up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the servic is integr into your Appl experi as the destin for system backup files, the default storag locat for file creat in the iWork offic suite, and an option for store user file in newer version of the macO system.Al of thi is design to keep user tightli bound to Apple' multi-devic ecosystem. Onc you'r in, it' not easi to get untangled. Given Apple' massiv market reach, especi in the tablet and smartphon segments, thi alon should make iCloud a winner. Appl CEO Tim Cook introduc the packag as ""a strategi for the next decade"" in 2012.However, Appl never quit deliv on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedli ostrac by other work group within the company, starv of resources, and mostli seen as a necessari evil. Appl is a product company, and iCloud is not a market product on it own -- at least not in it current Apple-centr form. So, thi odd piec of infrastructur machineri is left out in the cold.And there goe Apple' ticket to a $24 billion industri that' also on a rapid growth tear.Googl sure is build it Drive product into everyth from Gmail to mobil photo storag to storag space for corpor accounts. Dropbox is do the same, while on the lookout for anoth buyout bid. And thi market should onli grow faster as theInternet of Thingsgrow up, requir acr of cloud-bas storag space. These compani treat onlin file storag as an import business, valuabl on it own merits.Appl doesn't. Hence, the compani is hold back on promot iCloud, develop it further, or build it into other products, when appropriate. Cupertino miss out on a major growth story, with absolut no loyalti from the custom who do sign up.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CEF rais equiti via an IPO. The proce are then use to execut the desir invest strategi for the fund, and a limit and finit number of share are issued. Thus, it trade like a stock but oper more like a mutual fund or exchange-trad fund ,sinc they hold a basket of securities.Th trick withCEFsi find the one that are well-managed, that offer commensur reward to whatev risk they are taking.Th 7 Best ETF for Market-B ReturnsSo here are three differ type of CEF that are a bit riskier than I person like, but offer accept 10%-plu yield for those who don't mind that extra risk.Closed-End Fund to Buy: Eaton Vanc Risk-Manag Diversifi Equiti Inc. (ETJ)Distribut Rate:11%Eaton Vanc Risk-Mngd Dvrsfd Eqti Inc Fd(NYSE:ETJ) is pretti much what it is describ as, although it titl doesn't mention it core strategy, which is sell cover calls. I like ETJ becaus it take a veri similar approach that my forthcom stock advisori newsletter,Th Liberti Portfolio, takes. It buy certain high-qual stock and then sell cover call against them.ETJ buy stock likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andVisa, Inc.(NYSE:V) and sell cover call against them. That mean they sell contract for anoth parti to buy that stock from the fund at a given price on or befor a given day. Obviously, if the stock is below that price, the fund keep the stock and can sell more calls. Most importantly, it hold stock that are qualiti companies, so if the market tank and they get stuck with those stock … well, there are wors things.Th distribut rate is 11% and it current trade at more than a 9% discount to net asset value.Closed-End Fund to Buy: Pimco High Incom Fund (PHK)Distribut Rate:11%Pimco High Incom Fund(NYSE:PHK) is one of the best CEF that I have found, in regard to diversification. PHK ha 343 hold across mani differ kind of bonds. While half are corpor bonds, 27% are asset-backed, 12.5% are municip and 5% are govern bonds, and they are spread across just about everi kind of sector that exists. Matur are also diversified, with a healthi 38% matur in 1-4 years, 25% in 5-9 years, 16% in 10-20 years, and the rest are longer-term.Th averag coupon is 7.95%, but manag to distribut about 10.9% annually, thank to capit gains. Sinc inception, it annual total return are 13.8%, almost twice that of the 7.4% categori benchmark. That' also a major reason whi the PHK trade at a 30% premium to it NAV.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Normally, I wouldn't go near someth trade with that premium, except that it' about theaverageit ha trade at sinc the financi crisis.Closed-End Fund to Buy: Franklin Limit Durat Incom (FTF)Distribut Rate:10.8%Franklin Limit Durat Incom Trust of Benefici Interest(NYSE:FTF) is similar in structur to PHK, but ha a few import differ from other closed-end fund that invest in corpor debt. While 43% of the FTF portfolio consist of corpor bond that offer gener yields, 40% are invest in senior loans.What are senior loans? They are loan that are often secur by a company' assets. They are not consid invest grade and privat issu by variou bank and institut investor in a secondari market. They tend to be illiquid.Th differ between senior loan and bond is that the latter' interest rate are usual fix wherea senior loan rate tend to float. Anoth big difference: bond price will move invers with interest rates, but senior loan price do not chang when interest rate change. Thus, they act as a hedg against rise short-term rates.FTF ha a 10.8% distribut yield.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Samsung Facing 10-Nano Yield Issues,3/3/2017,"Contract chip manufacturersTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) both recent began mass product of chip use their respect 10-nanomet chip manufactur technologies.Both companies' 10-nanomet technolog allow chipmak to build more dens pack (mean more features) and higher-perform products, two thing that are gener good in the world of chips.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();However, accord to a recentreportfrom DigiTimes, both TSMC and Samsung are face manufactur yield issu with their respect 10-nanomet technologies. Let' go over the implic of those yield challenges.Whi are low manufactur yield bad?Manufactur yield refer to the percentag of manufactur chip that both work and meet the perform and power specif mandat by the design. It gener cost a fix amount of money to manufactur a wafer of chips, so the higher the yield rate, the greater the number of chip are produc for a given cost, which mean lower effect per-chip cost.Conversely, low yield rate mean higher costs. Such cost can either be pass on to the customer, the chip manufactur compani itself could eat the costs, or the respons could be shared.Additionally, chipmak put in a certain amount of manufactur capac in anticip of custom demand. If manufactur yield rate are too far below plan, then a custom use the low-yield technolog may not be abl to get ahold of suffici suppli of products.So, low manufactur yield are gener bad for business.Specif impact on TSMC' and Samsung' customersTh lead custom for TSMC' 10-nanomet technolog appear to be MediaTek, which is use thi technolog to manufactur it Helio X30 line of premium smartphon chips. In a statement to Nikkei Asian Review, a MediaTek executivesaidthat the X30 wa ""delay becaus the yield rate of 10 [nanometer] process technolog [from TSMC] ha not yet reach a satisfactori level... and we are a bit stuck on that.""A silver line here is that MediaTek doesn't expect signific adopt of the X30 in premium smartphon (say that it expect the X30 to be use in ""less than 10 smartphon models""), so these yield challeng are unlik to significantli disrupt MediaTek' busi or the busi of it customers.For Samsung and it lead customer, mobil chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the struggl is more significant. The Samsung Galaxi S8-seri devic that are set to be formal announc later thi month are expect to Samsung' Exyno 8895 for some variant and Qualcomm' Snapdragon 835 in other variants. Both chip are believ to be manufactur by Samsung use it 10-nanomet LPE technology. DigiTim say that Samsung delay the rollout of the Galaxi S8-seri devic due ""unsatisfactori yield rates.""How about the iPhone?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to tap TSMC to manufactur the former' upcom A11 applic processor on the latter' 10-nanomet technology. The bad news is that the yield challeng describ by DigiTim could impact Apple' abil to meet demand for it next-gener iPhones.Th good news is that Apple' next iPhon model aren't expect to launch until the fall, which give both Appl and TSMC addit time to work out the kink on the 10-nanomet technology.Furthermore, some of the yield issu that MediaTek may be see could be relat to it underli chip design rather than onli due to TSMC' technology. In that case, there' a reason chanc that Appl won't face quit the yield problem that MediaTek is appar cope with.10 stock we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Given the fuss over AAPL ditch the headphon jack in the iPhon 7, the spectr of the compani abandon anoth legaci port evok strong reaction.makeArticleAd();Source: Brad MoonNow, a new report from a well-known Appl analyst claim all 2017 iPhon - includ the 10th-anniversari iPhon 8 - will stick with Lightn ports, butwilladopt USB-C' fast-charg technology.Here' the latest on the Lightn port controversy.New Theory: AAPL Keep the Lightn PortMacRumorspublish KGI Secur analystMing-Chi Kuo' take on the controversy. He is certain all 2017 iPhones, includ the iPhon 8, will keep their Lightn port. However, he predict that AAPL is investig the adopt of the USB-C Power Deliveri standard in that Lightn port. Do so would retain compat with Lightn accessories, but with the advantag of much faster wire charg for the new iPhones.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchKuo also note sever reason whi AAPL would not choos to implement USB-C instead of stay with it proprietari Lightn port, beyond the potenti consum backlash. The compani would be give up revenu from it MFi program that certifi Lightn accessories. And USB-C port are physic larger than Lightn - given AAPL' obsess with make iPhon thinner, switch to a larger port seem unlikely.Whi Ha USB-C Been Such a Flashpoint Issue?Th meresuggestionthat AAPL would ditch the Lightn port in favor of USB-C ha gener a huge number of articl and editori and fill Appl forums. Whi the fanfar over a simpl charg port?Ther are actual two issu at play here.Th first is a sensit to Appl elimin legaci ports. After the compani got rid of the decades-old standard 3.5mm jack on the iPhon 7, there were accus AAPL had done so arbitrarili - mayb to sell more Beat wireless headphones. Even rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) hop on the bandwagon,mock AAPL' decisionwhen it launch the Galaxi Note 7 - complet with headphon jack.Aft the Galaxi Note 7' explod batteries, Samsung may avoid such public taunt in the future. Karma….In the fall, Appl releas a new MacBook Pro that had all legaci connect port replac with USB-C. Thi infuri mani long-tim Mac user becaus it meant have to buy adapt and dongl for all their current accessori and peripherals. A switch from Lightn to USB-C would be seen by mani as anoth Appl move done more or less arbitrarily, without consider for the impact it may have on customers.On the other side of the equation, there are also mani Appl fan who would love to see the compani ditch the proprietari Lightn port for USB-C, which is becom an industri standard.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beat the OddsCount MacBook Pro (and MacBook) owner in that group - they have to purchas a Lightn to USB-C cabl if they want to connect an iPhon to their laptop. These peopl were excit to see theWal Street Journal'spredictionthat AAPL would make the big move.So Where Are We Now on the iPhon 8 Lightn Port?A usual, no one know for certain what AAPL' plan are. I tend to side with the analyst who are suggest that Appl isn't about to court controversi with such a critic iPhon release, and will keep the Lightn port but mayb pack in a USB-C cabl or adapt thi time around.Th one thing youcanbet on is that AAPL is watch the convers and evalu reaction - if not for the iPhon 8, then for a littl further down the line.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 20177 Stock to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buy RangeTh postAppl Inc.

However, I'm not sure nostalgia for candi bar phone and keyboard PDA draw the right kind of attent to either company.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Schedul / Grid Engin via Flickr (Modified)For one, NOK never realli left the ""dumb"" end of the phone market behind, so the company' grand ""return"" with a new version of it near-indestruct 3310 handset - popular in 2001 at a price around $120 - is onli a shock to peopl who stop pay attention, which they did for a reason.Granted, the featur phone that NOK recent pull back out ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) orbit account for 9% of the categori last year, but that No. 2 share behindSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) onli ad up to 35 million handsets, or at best 2% of the global phone market.A Lesson in Scale for NOK StockSure, it' remot possibl that the return of the 3310 at $50 will somehow dramat revers 16 year of technolog progress, and be enough to convinc a new gener of back-to-bas consum to trade in their smartphones, I find it unlikely.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017I just don't see that happen here in number that even doubl NOK' market share, and even if it does, an extra 35 million $50 handset sold close to cost realli isn't go to move the needl for NOK stock. Even if the compani manag to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it' go to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That' the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it' still a big company, built on the chassi of the old Alcatel and Lucent network businesses. Now that it ha it phone back from MSFT, manag need to deploy them to embrac the futur and expand on the role the compani want to play in the Internet of Thing (IoT).To me, that mean develop phone that don't compet withAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consum pocket space, but one that instead let smart devic commun with each other. Consid that, in a world of billion of $50 machine-to-machin data relays, the market becom veri interest for NOK stock investors.It' a similar stori for BBRY, which wa evolv nice into an IoT proposition, until now.

Peltz, the chief of invest manag outfit Trian Partners, ha just as much of a histori of focus on solv execut problem - and even spur acquisit - as he doe split up companies.Th question is, what doe Procter & Gambl need most?PG Stock Is an Easi Activist TargetTh purchas washint at in December, though unnam at the time. In the meantim it' been confirm Peltz wa talk about what would eventu be 6.4 million share of PG stock.Th gener consensu is that Peltz intend to start improv the company' profit from the inside, cut cost and overhaul operations. More than just a few observers, however, suspect that is onli a precursor to break the compani up into more focus parts.And it' not as if the compani couldn't use the help.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowTh consum product name behind brand such as Pamper diapers, Ivori soap and Downi deterg wa onc a competitor nobodi want to face, and an invest everybodi want to own. Time, size, and complex have taken a toll on P&G.Revenu ha been dwindl for a coupl of year now, and while incom ha held steady, investor had good reason to expect growth.To it credit, Procter & Gambl ha been streamlin itself, recent sell a wide swath of it beauti brand toCoti Inc(NYSE:COTY) -$11.3 billion worth of beauti brands, to be precise. After alittl more than a year on the job though, CEO David Taylor wa expect by sharehold to show actual proof of life, rather than just shrink the compani toward success. It brand name - and the Procter & Gambl name itself - are too valuabl to let languish.Ent Nelson PeltzTo figur out how the activist investor intend to handl a new project, one onli ha to look at hi previou activist efforts. Unfortunately, Peltz ha wide vari repertoire.Tak Peltz' interest in Heinz, for instance. Back in 2006 -well befor it merg with Kraftto becomeKraft Heinz Co(NASDAQ:KHC) - Peltz took an interest and a control posit in the vener pickl and ketchup manufacturer, partli to encourag the spinoff of weaker, distract divisions, but mostli tocut cost the company' manag seem unwil or unabl to make. It wa that newli creat valu that got Warren Buffett'sBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and 3G Capitalinterest in buy Heinz in 2013, ultim set up the pair with Kraft.However, Peltz' $2.5 billion stake inGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE), taken in 2015, wasalmost an entir passiv one. CEO Jeff Immelt wa alreadi streamlin the compani and Peltz felt the market wa undervalu where GE wa going. Peltz wa just along for the ride, mostli leav the compani alone.Still, Trian Capital' reput as an activist stakehold is well-deserved, as Peltz ha in the past priorit divestitur and acquisit that manag team haven't wanted.Cas in point: In 2013, Peltz wa pushingPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) to acquir snack food makerMondelez Intern Inc(NASDAQ:MDLZ), an outcom that surprisingli didn't materialize, consid he wa amajor sharehold in both companies. Onc Peltz gave up on the idea of the marriage, he began to push for the spinoff of PepsiCo' snack food division. It would have been a veri close ""next best thing"" to a union of Mondelez and PepsiCo.Cost cut were also alway part of the discuss between Peltz and PepsiCo, but never realli the priority.Bottom Line for PG StockTh question is: which of those three previou situat doe Procter & Gambl most resembl now? Is the consum stapl giant too big and too dispar for it own good and would be better off split itself up, or is the organ just bloated, with too mani overlap parts, each incur unnecessari expenses?Most long-term owner of PG stock like see the organization' challeng aren't root in too much diversity, but rather, in year of sloppi integr of a varieti of busi lines. Indeed, with the bulk of it brand all readili avail in groceri stores, the opportun for synergi as well as cross-market are terrific; market is larg the same sort of shtick for each of it product lines.Costco Wholesal Corpor (COST) Stock: The Danger Is GrowingAt the same time, there' littl assur that ani divestitur would command an attract price in the open market even if P&G and Peltz did want to spin off some units.That' arguabl okay with Peltz, who ismor of an oper activistthan one who simpli ""unlock value"" by break compani apart. In other words, he' play the long game here and that' a good thing for loyal shareholders. Current and prospect owner of PG stock have been wait too long for thi ride to get underway.Of course, if that effort doesn't get traction, Peltz isn't afraid to press for spinoffs, either.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTrad Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock for No-Cost ProfitsQualcomm, Inc.

Qualcomm' high-margin fabless model had been a big part of the bull case for QCOM stock. Suddenly, that royalty-bas model look more like that of a ""patent troll"" than a desir licens stream. QCOM stock fell 13% on the news, and ha regain onli a portion of those losses.makeArticleAd();Source:Karli Dambran via FlickrWhil the AAPL lawsuit ha been the headlin news, there are other concern for Qualcomm shareholders. Competition, regulatori pressur and earn all present risk at the moment. It' not as if QCOM stock is price in incred growth, with the stock trade at about 12x 2017 analyst consensu EPS. But Qualcomm may not be price in all those risks, either.AAPL and QCOM StockWhat' notabl about the chang in sentiment toward QCOM stock is that the recent concerns, on their own, shouldn't bethatbig a deal. The Appl lawsuit is no exception. AAPL is ask for $1 billion in damages, which isn't a lot of money for Qualcomm. QCOM stock ha a market cap of $82 billion; a $1 billion payment would repres about 1.2% of it value, or about less than 70 cent per share.Meanwhile, Qualcomm end it first quarter (end Dec. 25) with over $10 billion in cash and market secur on it balanc sheet. QCOM quit liter could simpli write a check for the $1 billion in damag - even if it lose or settl with Apple.But the concern is that the Appl lawsuit is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Apple' content is that Qualcomm' price itself is unfair. QCOM - per Apple' interpret - charg royalti base on the valu of the entir device, not just the technolog be licensed.On AAPL' Q1 earn call, CEO Tim Cook said the strategi wa ""somewhat like buy a sofa, and you charg somebodi a differ price depend upon the price of the hous that it goe into.""5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchQualcomm natur ha defend it strategy, and it' too earli to tell on whose side U.S. court will fall. But the question rais by the Appl lawsuit have implic that go beyond a singl court case.QCOM Stock and Licens RevenueTh core problem for QCOM stock is that Appl isn't alon in question it model. Qualcomm ha been hit with an $800 million-plu fine in South Korea for alleg antitrust violat under a similar theori to that be push by AAPL. (That fine is under appeal.) Qualcomm alreadi paid nearli a billion dollar to settl an investig in China. And a week befor the Appl lawsuit, the U.S. FTC announc it own investigation.Th issu isn't just fine and lawsuits, or a billion dollar here and anoth billion there. The licens model is the foundat of Qualcomm' business. Per the company' 10-K, the licens segment gener $6.5 billion in pre-tax earnings. The rest of the compani creat $2.2 billion in profit - bare one-third of the licens business' total.If QCOM' royalti rate ha to come down, or the base on which those royalti is charg move from the valu of the product to the valu of the part, Qualcomm' profit margin and revenu can come down substantially. Potenti chang in the licens model are a legitim risk to QCOM stock. And it' not the onli risk out there.QCOM Stock Ha Other Concerns, TooEven if the licens model stay larg intact, Qualcomm' sale and earn have other sourc of pressure. Overal market growth for smartphones, in particular, is stall out. That' one reason whi AAPL stock - even at all-tim high - still ha a rel modest earn multiple.In response, Qualcomm is acquiringNXP Semiconductor NV(NASDAQ:NXPI), which will move the compani into automot and IoT (Internet of Things). But that acquisit also move Qualcomm into a more tradit manufactur model - and won't close until the end of thi year, per compani guidance. Benefit from the merger will take some time to accrue, and Qualcomm could see integr disrupt in 2018.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beat the OddsFinally, there' competition.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) ha partial displac QCOM in some iPhon models, and could take more slot if the legal battl take time to play out. In automotive, NXP will take onNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) andMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY). That' a lot of giant take on a tight market - one reason whi NVDA stock ha slump more than 16% over the past few weeks.I there enough to short QCOM? Probabl not - not unless an investor is will to aggress bet on Apple' interpret of Qualcomm' busi model. But there' enough here to justifi the recent slump in QCOM stock, and an earn multipl that look simpli too low.

Bad News for Apple Inc.'s OLED iPhone,3/3/2017,"Later thi year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to introduc three new iPhones. The first two will be typic refresh of it iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu models, respectively, while the third is expect to be an ultra-premium model with a curv OLE display and other featur that'll make it a technic tour-de-force.Th gener expect is that the compani plan to releas all three model thi fall. However, a new report from DigiTimes, cite ""industri sources,"" suggest that the compani might not be abl to launch -- or, at the veri least, begin ship -- the OLE iPhon until after the standard model launch.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();A redesign fingerprint scanner drive a delayP the report, which cite ""industri sources,"" Appl ha ""decid to use it own Authentec algorithm combin with Privari glass identif to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution.""What' interest is that Appl purchas nearli the entireti of Privaris' patent portfolio between Decemb 2012 and Octob 2014, per CNN. Furthermore, MacRumor report back in 2015 that Privari had ""essenti shut down"" about five year prior to the public of the report.""Thi certainli appear to be a patent portfolio purchas rather than a full acquisit of Privari by Apple,"" MacRumors' Joe Rossignol wrote at the time.Bas on DigiTimes' report and the inform from CNN and MacRumors, it realli look like thi new fingerprint identif solut is a home-grown effort by Apple, potenti year in the making.Du to Appl need to redesign it fingerprint scan technolog for the OLE iPhone, DigiTimes' sourc say that the iDevic maker' OLE iPhon might not go into product until Septemb (the other two models, DigiTim says, will go into product in July).What doe thi mean for Appl and the OLE iPhone?It take some time to go from volum product to devic in customers' hands. For example, DigiTim say that the iPhon 7s/7 Plu will go into product in July, so we'r look at about a two-month lag between when mass product start and when custom can get their new phones.So, if DigiTim is right, custom might not be abl to get ahold of the new OLE iPhon until November.Now, there are two cours of action that come to mind here. The first is that Appl can simpli announc the new OLE iPhon alongsid the other model in the fall, begin to take pre-ord for the OLE model, and then just ship them out as soon as practicable.Appl could also hold two separ launch events; the first for the refresh version of the current iPhones, with the launch of the more expens OLE iPhon just a few month later.Personally, I think that the first cours of action is more like for a coupl of reasons:If Appl doesn't launch the hotli anticip OLE iPhon in the fall, custom who realli want phone with curv OLE display might just give up on Appl and choos devic from competitor (even if they would have prefer an Appl phone all els equal).Th OLE iPhon is like to be significantli more expens than the regular models. Appl realli shouldn't risk potenti drive a ""mix down"" in iPhon sale by have some custom opt for the cheaper iPhon 7s/7 Plu for lack of anoth option when they would have been will to pay more for the more expens OLE iPhon (if it were announced/avail for pre-order).Of course, Appl is better off delay a product a smidgen to make sure it' readi to go and if the redesign fingerprint scanner meaning enhanc the user experience, then the delay is probabl worth it.But, if it' true, it'll be a bummer for some Appl custom and could potenti push out when Appl begin to enjoy the financi benefit of the next-gener iPhon cycle.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Berkshire' fourth, fifth, and sixth biggest hold areIBM,American Express, andPhillip 66,valu at about $13 billion, $11 billion, and $6 billion, respectively.Stil a fraction of Berkshire' whole businessDespit be Berkshire' second-largest hold now, investor shouldn't expect Berkshire' perform to be heavili influenc by Appl stock. Berkshir is a larg compani in it own right, with a market capit of $432 billion. Further, Berkshire' result remain more close tie to it wholli own subsidiari than it equiti portfolio.First in import at Berkshir is it wholli own insur businesses, which includ giant Berkshir Hathaway Reinsur Group, Gener Re, GEICO, and more.

Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago,3/3/2017,"Snapchat (Shutterstock photo)Mani on Wall Street are compar Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that' okay. All three can be consid social networks, reli on daili activ user and gener the major of their revenu from advertising.In the future, however, Snap may wind up be more like anoth Silicon Valley giant than the aforement one -- Appl (AAPL).makeArticleAd();Buy stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company' prowess as an advertis behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionari the world ha not seen seen Apple' Steve Job and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.Ther are similar between Job and Spiegel, both start their compani after drop out of college, are wonder salesmen and marketers, but the similar go further than that.Job is Spiegel' idol; he ha a portrait of the legendari Appl co-found hang in hi office. When unveil Spectacl toTh Wall Street Journalthi past fall, he even use Jobs-ian language, say ""You wanna see it?"" as he took off the towel cover the product. Thi mental play to the cultur of secreci at both companies, not releas product until they are readi to be talk about.And unlik other technolog companies, neither Snap or Appl have ""beta"" products. There is no group of earli adopt buy and use a product so the compani can get an idea of how user are interact with it and then continu to refine. Everi meticul detail is thought out and obsess over and is not releas until it' perfect.Aegi Capit analyst Victor Anthoni said the company' most valuabl asset is it demographic, with 13-24 year old compris nearli 60% of it user base. While these are highli covet by advertis such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company' most valuabl asset. The abil to know what peopl want befor they want or see it is an invalu trait that veri few execut have. It can not be measur or valued, but it' someth that investor need to keenli awar of when look at where to put their invest dollars.Snap ha posit and sold itself as a camera company, have mention that multipl time in it S-1. Thi can allow them to expand into everyth and anyth that ha a camera.Despit the optim surround Spiegel, the sticki of Snapchat (engag level are shockingli high) and the covet user base, it' not all rose for Snap at thi stage.Ther are concern about the company' financi picture, as it still gener the major of it revenu from advertising. Go up against Facebook and Google, which have mountain of user data that advertis love, can be a daunt task (just ask Twitter).Issu surround slow user growth, the abil for competitor to copi product features, lack of data analytics, no vote control with Class A share are all valid reason to be wari of Snap, especi at a $35 billion valuation.But again, it come down to be at the forefront of an area that' onli go to expand with a product visionari for a CEO.Images, whether it' augment reality, virtual reality, move or static, are humanity' future.

Don't Miss the Red Flags at Qorvo,3/3/2017,"In the third quarter, just over a third ofQorvo's(NASDAQ: QRVO) revenu came from it largest customer. Though Qorvo didn't name thi custom explicitly, it is wide believedth company' biggest account isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , to which it suppli radio frequenc chip to enhanc signals. Thi would make Qorvo one of the more diversifi Appl suppliers, especi compar toSkywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andCirru Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) , which are reportedli depend on Appl for 40% and 85% of their revenues, respectively.In that light, Qorvo seem like a diversifi bet. What' more, Qorvo' second-largest customer, with 11% of revenue, is the fast-grow Chines smartphon playerHuawei. Additionally, it countsSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) among it client list.Al thi diversification, however, couldn't save Qorvo from set weak guidanc for the fourth quarter. Qorvo expect it fourth-quart revenu to be $630 million at the midpoint of it guidanc range. Thi is much lower than the consensu revenu estim of $719 million, and if Qorvo manag to hit the midpoint of it guidance, it revenu will increas just 3.6% from the prior-year period.makeArticleAd();Let' take a look at what' go on with the compani and whi investor should take note.Imag source: Qorvo.Th problem at QorvoQorvo' key smartphon client are under pressure, and thi is reflect in the company' guidance. CFO Mark Murphi had the follow to say about the company' weak outlook dure the Feb. 1 confer call (transcript viaSeek Alpha), ""Thi guidanc primarili reflect a greater than histor sequenti declin in the March quarter, as two of our lead custom in China and a tier 1 custom in Korea delay flagship smartphon launches.""Th delay smartphon launch by Qorvo' Korean custom seem to be a refer to Samsung, sinc the Galaxi S8 won't be launch at the Mobil World Congress happen thi week, as the S7 wa last year. Samsung is reportedli go to launch it flagship in April instead, as it carri out intens test of the devic to avoid a Note7-lik fiasco. There' no doubt that thi delay ha push back Qorvo' potenti revenu from Samsung by at least a quarter and led to a weak outlook.Meanwhile, Appl is believ to be slash it iPhon product by roughli 10% in the current quarter, after produc more unit than it sold dure the holiday period. Suppli chain data suggest that Appl place order to manufactur 89 million iPhon unit in the December-end quarter, while it sold onli 78.3 million. Thi leav Appl with a surplu of around 10 million iPhon for the current quarter, so it ha reportedli decid to scale back production.In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Secur is of the opinion that iPhon product will declin throughout the first half of 2017, until the product cycl of the next model kick in. So, it look like Qorvo will not get ani bump in it revenu from it largest custom in the first half of 2017. But is there more afoot here than just declin smartphon orders?I Skywork eat Qorvo' lunch?Qorvo is a direct competitor of Skywork Solutions, as both compani make radio-frequ compon for the same customers. However,Skywork provid a strong outlookfor the current quarter when it releas result in January. It revenu expect of $840 million mean that it top line could grow 8% from the prior-year period and exceed consensu analyst estim of $818 million, while Qorvo' revenu is expect to increas just 3.6%.A Skyworks' outlook is rosier than Qorvo's, the former could be win market share. Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuiti (viaBarron's) ha a similar opinion, writing:W also believ Skywork is increas content with Samsung and is well posit for content growth with new Samsung product ramp in the upcom quarters. We believ other Chines OEM will follow Huawei' leadership with increas RF content.Additionally, Skywork CEO Liam Griffin said that hi compani ha seen content win in ""multipl devic across Samsung' entir portfolio, and gain momentum in China, with key win at market leader Oppo, Vivo, Meizu, and Xiaomi."" The comment made by Skywork after it latest result indic that it is win a lot of content in the same area where Qorvo is not feel confident.In fact, Huawei ha now becom Skyworks' second-largest custom after Skywork won almost all of the RF chip spot in Huawei' P9 flagship smartphon last year. On the other hand, Skywork had reportedli won three spot in the iPhon 7, while Qorvo suppli two chips. In comparison, both compani had two chip each insid the iPhon 6s, accord to a teardown of the devic by Chipworks.Th competit from Skywork is a red flag that Qorvo investor should not ignore.10 stock we like better than QorvoWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Could Be Berkshire's Next Tech Buy,3/2/2017,"After load up onApple(AAPL) shares, couldBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buyAlphabet Inc.(GOOG) (GOOGL) share next? Alphabet ha been bought aggress by multipl famou gurus. Buffett and Munger have comment favor on the company' competit posit sever times. The latest Berkshir sharehold letter indic Buffett is veri knowledg about the technolog space.Th fact that so mani valu investor are buy Alphabet at current multipl indic it is a great busi at a fair price. It is not immedi obviou how popular the stock is becaus Alphabet trade an A and a C share class, which are treat as seper compani by list put togeth through automation. They are econom equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-own stock among the great investor track by GuruFocus.Back in 2009,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) talk aboutIBM(IBM), Appl and Google:makeArticleAd();""Th chanc of be way wrong in IBM are probabl less, at least for us, than the chanc of be way wrong in Googl or Apple. I just don't know how to valu them.I would not be at all surpris to see them be worth a lot more money 10 year from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charli Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Googl ha a huge new moat. In fact, I'v probabl never seen such a wide moat.""Mung ad it wa also fill with sharks. It is imposs to assess a moat without understand competitor and their chanc to success assault a company' market share. In thi case, Munger might have seen the potenti earli while Buffett remain unconvinced. Buffett ha allud to hi biggest mistak as act of omission.Bil Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, step down in 2014. Microsoft run the onli real competit to Googl search. Gate step down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competit landscap from him.In additon, Googl founder Larri Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt travel to Omaha to talk to Buffett when set up the new Alphabet structure, which is mold after Berkshire.Shortli befor the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understand the tech founders' goal for the company.Buffett includ the follow paragraph in the 2017 sharehold letter, put my spider sens on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor assert that 'Bi 2029 no comput - or 'machin intelligence' - will have pass the Ture Test,' which deal with whether a comput can success imperson a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the oppos view. Each back up hi opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win thi bet, but I will confid wager that no comput will ever replic Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundi of Microsoft assert that pilotless plane would routin fli passeng by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Googl argu otherwise. The stake were $1,000 each. To eas ani heartburn Eric might be experienc from hi outsiz exposure, I recent offer to take a piec of hi action. He promptli laid off $500 with me. (I like hi assumpt that I'll be around in 2030 to contribut my payment, should we lose.)""Thi paragraph show Buffett ha been studi the tech world veri hard and is open to the possibl the Ture test will be crack by 2029. He also must have look into the dynam of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent invest into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think bet against Buffett is gener a profit endeavour. What jump out at me is, apparently, Alphabet' chairman and Buffett recent spoke again. They must have spoken for quit some time for the subject of thi casual bet to come up.Al these factor have led me to specul on the potenti of an Alphabet investment.Th piec are fall into place.Buffett ha been studi tech intensely.Berkshir ha made a 180 as far as tech invest go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as have an incred strong moat.Alphabet' valuat is at an attract level given the interest from the valu invest greats. Porat is a great addit to the execut suit ,cover up pre-exist weak in the team.Googl execut have met with Buffett on multipl occas and Schmidt talk to him recently.Th one thing I could see keep Buffett from make an invest is hi distast for stock-bas compensation.

What Does Warren Buffett See in Apple?,3/2/2017,"SinceWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)' annual letter came out and he follow up with a lengthi interview on CNBC where he talk about how much moreApple(AAPL) stock Berkshir now own - and how he wa the one who bought most of it - I have gotten a lot of email question ask about hi purchase.Thi is not the first time I have receiv a slew of email question the logic of one of Buffett' investments. Sinc I have been write articl about investing, he ha made four invest that realli got a reaction from valu investor who doubt the logic of what he wa doing. These include: Buffett' initi purchas of railroad stock and hi subsequ purchas of all of Burlington Northern, hi invest inIBM(IBM) despit him have said he doe not invest in tech stocks, hi invest in the four major U.S. airlin despit the fact he ha said the airlin industri is a terribl one for investor and now hi invest in Apple.Berkshir Hathaway' (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) invest in Appl is far from the most controversi of these cases. A bunch of other valu investor like the stock. It is a reason price stock on an enterpris valu basi - Appl ha a lot of net cash, so it market cap exagger the valuat be put on the company. But, each of these invest by Buffett is an exampl of him move into an area he had not previous touched. I am not sure Buffett ever invest in a railroad stock despit the fact that when he start hi career - in the earli 1950 - railroad stock were a much bigger part of the invest landscap than they are today. Buffett may not have bought tech stock befor IBM - but it is, in most everi other respect, the kind of stock Buffett would normal buy.makeArticleAd();Also, Buffett previous said the reason he never ownedMicrosoft(MSFT) wa becaus no matter whether it wa true or not - peopl would assum the purchas wa the result of insid inform from hi friend,Bil Gates(Trades, Portfolio). He also said, however, that at one pointMicrosoft stockgot to a price - presumably, thi is sometim after the 2008 financi crisi - that seem low to him. Buffett rare talk about whether the price of a stock seem low, high, etc. unless he understand someth about that busi and that industry. So, it is not unreason to think Buffett believ he understand some thing about Microsoft. And those thing might allow him to - within a veri wide valu rang - know whether even a tech stock like Microsoft is cheap or not.Now, let' look at Apple. What doe Buffett see in that stock? The number one thing that appeal to Buffett about Appl is someth that should not matter at all to you. Buffett is attract to Apple' size. It is a huge stock. Buffett said on that same CNBC interview I mention that Berkshir wa unlik to take a bigger than 10% stake in a compani becaus of the problem that presents. Berkshir ha end up with more than 10% of a company' stock, but that ha often been help along by share repurchas on the part of the compani itself.Right now, Ted Weschler and Todd Comb are each run $10 billion portfolio at Berkshire. Those are the small portfolios. Buffett is invest at a whole order of magnitud more in size. But, let' start with just the kind of idea Weschler and Comb need to come up with.Assum you are run a $10 billion portfolio that is fulli invest in common stocks. Further assum you want to avoid buy more than 10% of a company' stock. Now, assum you are a concentr type investor the way Buffett is. As I write, my own portfolio is 65% invest in just two stocks:Frost(CFR) andBWX Technologies(BWXT). It is 85% invest in just three stocks. The third stock, however, is a micro-cap. Manag invest billion of dollar cannot even look at a micro-cap. The veri smallest stock they can possibl buy are thing like Frost and BWX Technologies. So, how much of their portfolio could they put in those two stocks? Remember, I have 65% of my portfolio in those stocks.Well, if you are manag $10 billion, and you are buy stock in a compani with a market cap of about $6 billion (which is about the size of Frost and BWX), you can put just under $600 million into the compani without cross the 10% ownership threshold. So, say you have two good idea that are each $6 billion compani - put them both togeth and you get just 12% of your portfolio in those stocks. Now, for me personally, I do not want to spend time worri about a stock that is much less than 20% of my portfolio. Here, we are talk about stock that are 6% of your portfolio if you buy absolut as much of them as possible. You see the problem. And I have underst it.Buffett is run about 10 time what Weschler and Comb are run individually. And neither Frost nor BWX Technolog is a small company. Within it nich of Texan banks, Frost is the biggest. And within it nich of nuclear work for govern rather than civilians, BWX Technolog is the biggest. So, Buffett cannot be look for compani that have market cap of $6 billion. He want compani with market cap of $60 billion or even $600 billion. Appl ha a market cap of even more than $600 billion. So, here we have a compani where instead of put just 5% of your portfolio into the stock at the veri most, you might get the chanc to put 10%, 20% or even 50% of your portfolio into the stock. When Buffett wa run hi partnership, he like to put 25% into hi best idea. In the case ofAmerican Express(AXP), he even went beyond that. If we do a littl math with the amount of money Buffett manag at Berkshire, we can see that idea in the $100 billion to $700 billion market cap rang are really, realli use to him becaus he can potenti deploy $10 billion to $70 billion (10% of the valu of these kind of companies) into such gigant public companies.Think about what kind of compani you have in the $100 billion to $700 billion range. It is pretti limited. Buffett like focus companies. He like brands. A great idea for Buffett is someth likeCoca-Cola(KO), American Express,Wel Fargo(WFC),Moody's(MCO), or Gillette. Those were great idea becaus they were not just big companies. They did veri few thing in a veri big way. Buffett' stake in Gillett got swap intoProct & Gamble(PG) stock. He eventu did a deal to get out of P&G by take control of Duracell. Duracel is a big brand like Gillette. P&G is an even bigger company, but onli a few of it brand are huge in a way that is use to Buffett. P&G as a whole is more diversifi into thing that are not realli as good as Gillett is on a standalon basis.Not onli is Appl a huge company, it is a huge focus company, which is attract to Buffett. Apple' fortun are now tie to one brand (a they realli alway have been) and larg to one product (the iPhone). When you listen to what Buffett said about Apple, you realiz how import thi is. Buffett said he like Apple. He said he see how integr the iPhon is to the live of peopl - especi young peopl - who now have it. And he say that he see - at place like the Nebraska Furnitur Mart store he own - that peopl upgrad from one iPhon to anoth instead of consid compet brands. So, the invest thesi is surprisingli focus for a giant company. It realli ha to do with one brand and one product, the iPhone. That is it. Buffett can evalu the sticki of one consum product and one brand. That make Appl easier to understand than Procter & Gambl orDisney(DIS) or other giant consumer-ori busi that are actual much more diversified. Appl is not diversified. That is the potenti attraction.Mov on, Buffett think Apple, like IBM, is not go to do a lot of big acquisitions. He think the compani is go to buy back a lot of it own stock. Thi is a veri common theme in a lot of hi investments. One of the surest sign you can find for a ""catalyst"" that might chang hi think about a compani is that compani turn inward and focus on the thing it doe best while dedic it free cash flow toward reduc it share count year after year instead of expand into other areas.Buffett is not an activist investor, but if you look at those area where he ha been most vocal - either while on a board, in the way he abstain from a vote or what he said to the press - it is almost alway a capit alloc decision. It is usual relat to the issuanc of compani stock. Sometim it is relat to overpaying. Nonetheless, he is constantli urg the manag of the compani he invest in to focu on widen their moat, do what they do best and invest in themselv at a reason price (bi buy back their own stock) rather than invest in somebodi els by overpaying.Th onli time I can think of Buffett have ani complaint about Coca-Cola had to do with an acquisit the compani want to do (at too high a price) or with give stock to top executives. The stock grant to execut incid at Coke wa report in the press as Buffett complain about execut be overpaid. I think the reason he abstain on that vote had more to do with the fact the compani would be permit to caus a lot of dilut if it use the program to the full extent it wa ask sharehold approv for. So, it wa probabl more about Buffett want Coca-Cola to shrink it share count rather than grow it.When Buffett wa ask on CNBC about the growth prospect of both IBM and Apple, he answer by talk about share buybacks. Befor Buffett bought it, IBM had one of the longest and most aggress histori of buy back it own stock you can find at ani public company. A lot of Berkshire' invest have thi feature. Look at how much American Express ha shrunk it share count sinc Buffett bought that position. Or look at how much Coca-Cola ha bought back of it own stock. In both cases, I'm pretti sure Berkshire' invest are worth at least 33% more than they otherwis would be becaus these compani have shrunk their share count by more than 25% while Berkshir own them. Buffett mention in the CNBC interview that Appl had bought back almost 5% of it stock in a year. That is unlik to be a one-tim thing. Appl will have problem with where it cash is locat - it will end up with a lot of cash that would be tax if brought back to the U.S. - but it doe not need cash to grow, it cannot grow that fast anymor organ and it doe not do big acquisitions.For a tech compani it size, Appl ha histor been especi avers to acquisitions. A compani as profit as Appl that doe not use money on high-priced, transform acquisit is eventu go to have to use that cash to buy back it own stock. There just are not ani other realist options. It could pay dividends; and becaus of Berkshire' own tax status, Buffett would benefit at least as much from dividend as from (fairli or overpriced) buybacks. He doe not mind dividends, and he certainli doe not mind buyback at stock he chose in the first place.What about Apple' lack of futur growth? I think thi actual attract Buffett. That sound counterintuitive. But, let me explain. Appl is a tech stock and a consum product company. The most danger time to invest in tech stock and consum product stock is when they sell a high-pric product to a small pool of customers. The reason for thi is that it allow market entri at the low end. If you are sell $1,000 watch or $10,000 computers, someon can come in sell a cheaper and more basic version of the product to a larg group of peopl who have never own the product. All sort of market leader run into thi problem. They have the biggest dollar share of the industry, but economi of scale - and certainli gain in experi - are driven in larg by the unit volum you do. The leader is in an awkward posit becaus tri to expand the market cut into their profit on a per-custom basis.If you are sell comput to corpor custom - you are not dream of the day when everi live room in America can have a cheap, basic desktop. That futur is potenti bad for you in sever ways. One, it teach whoever you are compet with a lot about mani of the thing you do. Two, it cheapen the imag of what you are selling. Three, it chang the way you will have to sell what you are selling. Almost all technology, especi ani sort of consum tech, follow thi pattern. It can be veri tough for investor becaus it lead to a two-stag adopt of the technology.In phase one, one leader establish their domin in the ""pro"" market and the stock look great. But, in phase two, anoth - and usual differ - leader establish their domin in the ""consumer"" market. Then that stock look great at the expens of the first leader. We could be talk about comput or cell phone here. But if you go back further in history, TV and radio follow the same pattern too. These thing are alway invent long, long befor you rememb them be invented, but were not adopt quickly. Peopl tend to rememb when they start see cell phone everywhere, when they start use the internet in their own home and so on. Those year have noth to do with when these product were first invented, commerci and so forth. Often, there wa a compani you have complet forgotten about that made and lost a fortun befor the time period you even think of the new consum tech as be suddenli import to society.What doe thi have to do with Apple? It is part of a broader question. Just how ""moaty"" are consum technolog companies? At least on one side of the econom valu equation, compani like Apple,Facebook(FB) andAlphabet' Googl (GOOG)(GOOGL) depend entir on the mass appeal of their product. We call them technolog companies. Internally, I am sure they seem veri technic to those insid the organization. But how much doe technolog drive the econom return at these companies? And, at thi point, how easi is it to attack ani of these busi model on some technic differ between your product and theirs? How much of what make the iPhon success is the Appl brand, the fact a custom alreadi own an iPhon and is use to use it, the fact a customer' friends, famili and peer alreadi own an iPhon and, as a consequence, the fact other entrepreneur and organ have invest time money and effort in tri to reach peopl by design product to be use on an iPhone?In other words, ha the iPhon becom the default choic for custom becaus the Appl brand is good enough, the statu quo is good enough, peopl are not all go to jump on anoth bandwagon togeth and the supplier are go to be where the demand is? Is the iPhon alway go to be the easiest choice? Thi is exactli the same question for Facebook and Google. A veri long time ago, I wrote that while I did not ownGoogl stockand did not know how the organ would develop over time as a company, I did know that understand anyth technic about a search engin no longer mattered. Googl doe not need to be the world' best search engin to be the world' most popular search engine. The advantag it ha are too entrench and the differ between one set of search result and anoth are so small - Googl doe not realli have to compet on qualiti anymore. Googl is enough of a brand and search is enough of a commod that it doe not matter.Th thing that got Appl to the posit it is now in are not necessarili the thing that will keep it there. A lot of reader email me ask about Apple' brand and whether it would last. The answer to that is ye and no. It will be a recogniz brand that is seen as good enough in a decad or two. I would be veri surpris if that changed. On the other hand, I would be surpris if the Appl brand wa seen as be particularli innov or stand for veri specif design choic or anyth like that in a decad or two. Coca-Cola is a great brand, but it is not a veri specif brand. It cannot be anymore. When peopl think cola they think Coca-Cola. And when peopl think phone - they think Apple. But, Appl will not need to convinc anyon to tri a smartphon for the first time anymore. They do not realli even have to convinc anyon to tri an Appl product for the first time anymore.Appl ha veri high return on the money it actual tie up in it business. The number look lower becaus they have excess cash. Likewise, the stock look more expens than it is becaus it ha a lot of excess cash. If Apple' sale grow somewher between nomin GDP and the rate of inflat in the countri where it oper in and the compani dedic everi cent it make - or more, sinc Appl alreadi ha net cash - to buy back it own shares, it will still be a ""growth"" stock on an EP basis. For an exampl of this, see BWX Technologies. It is not realli a growth compani at all in term of what it does. It doe not gain new custom (outsid of the U.S. Navy). It doe not win total new project (outsid of the carrier and sub it ha long provid reactor for). And it doe not even get mani more order for a higher build rate for the number of those ship now than it did in the recent past. Despit all that, the compani just put out a press releas say it expect a ""low double-digit"" EP growth rate for the next three to five years. That is a growth stock, but it is one becaus it is do someth very, veri profit on a return on capit basis. It is retain all the busi it alreadi ha and grow the busi it retain a tini but consist bit, and then it is take all the money it make and buy back it own stock. When a super high-qual busi buy back it own stock, it is not imposs to turn an underli 5% type growth rate in how much more your custom actual want into more like a 10% growth rate in the earn you report per share.IBM is anoth good exampl of that. In the 10 year befor Buffett bought the stock, it wa not veri good at company-wid revenu growth. Over the last decade, IBM had close to 9% annual EP growth at the same time it had close to zero percent revenu growth. A lot of that is accomplish simpli by not grow the asset you tie up in the busi at all (IBM' net tangibl asset actual shrank over the last decade) and then take all your free cash flow and - instead of grow asset like most compani do - use it to reduc your share count.What Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) see in Appl is probabl a slow growth, wide moat consum brand that can use all it free cash flow to buy back it own stock and therebi be a high-growth stock in term of EPS, even while it is slow growth in term of addit unit sold. Appl may not be a growth compani anymore, but that doe not mean it cannot be a growth stock. All Buffett care about is the growth in earn per share. So, he is not necessarili bet Appl can sell a lot more iPhon over the next five to 10 years. What Buffett' bet on is Apple' abil to report a lot more in earn per share over the next five to 10 years.Disclosures: Long CFR, BWXTStart afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

You bet.Th Posit for NKE StockOn could argu that a price-to-earn ratio of 25.5 is still a bit expensive. But one could also point out that thi is near the low-end of Nike' five-year range, as shown below:Valu is a consider for me, but it is not the most import factor in the game. I care about the long-term business. I care that there' a long runway to it success and that when the growth doe eventu slow, that there will be a continu flow of income, both for the busi and into my pockets.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017On that note, Nike stock yield just 1.3%. But, it dividend ha been grow by double-digit for basic the past 10 years. I say basic becaus Nike ""only"" rais it dividend by 9.7% in 2009.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets – Literally,3/2/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' been a strong - and long-await - run forAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. AAPL stock is up 19% year-to-d as of thi writing, and ha gain by about one-third sinc the U.S. presidenti election. Appl stock struggl for some time, hit an 18-month low below $90 in May. But clearli investor sentiment ha turned.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, overal investor sentiment ha improv as well. Broad market have strengthen in 2017 and sinc the election. TheDow Jone Industri Average- as imperfect a measur as it is - clear 21,000 on Wednesday. But AAPL stock itself ha been a major driver of those broad market gains.Just how much Appl stock - and, to a lesser extent, issu of other titan such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - ha move those indic might surpris you.How Appl Stock Impact the S&P 500The S&P500i up 6.9% year-to-d as of thi writing. That index consist of the 500 most import stock in the U.S. market (not necessarili the largest), and compris 70%-80% of total U.S. market capitalization, accord to Standard & Poor' itself.It would thu seem that AAPL on it own couldn't move the index all that much. After all, 1 out of 500 is a small fraction, even as big as Appl is. Yet Appl stock still drive about 3.6% of the index' returns.Snapchat IPO: Lofti Snap Inc (SNAP) Walk on EggshellsGiven a 19% YTD return, then, Appl alon ha push the S&P 500 higher by about 0.69% in just two months. Fulli one-tenth of the broad market index' growth ha comejust from AAPL.And Appl isn't the onli large-cap driver. AMZN stock, now up 9% for the year, ha ad 0.2 points, or 3%, of the index' growth. The three largest financi in the index -JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM),Wel Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) andBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) - have ad roughli 7% of the S&P 500' perform so far in 2017.In other words, roughli 20% of the broad market' gain in 2017 from come just from five major stocks. And the figur sinc the elect is actual abov one-quarter, with the three major financi creat 15% of the S&P' 12%-plu post-elect gains.That' not to say that market strength is a mirage. Fulli three-quart of S&P 500 stock are posit in 2017 as of thi writing. But it ha been a more top-heavi market than usual - and the impact of Appl stock, in particular, is even higher in other well-known indexes.AAPL and the Dow Jone Industri AverageTh DJIA is differ from most other indic in that it' weight by price, not market value. The most heavili weight compon in the Dow isGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS), becaus it stock price is over $250. The least import Dow Jone compon isGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE), trade just abov $30.Yes, it' weird.That mean Appl stock actual ha the seventh-highest weight in the DJIA. (AMZN isn't even excluded, becaus of it $800-plu handle.) But Apple' strong gain still mean that it ha driven over 12% of the Dow Jones' year-to-d increase.Appl isn't alon in drive the index.Bo Co(NYSE:BA) ha ad anoth 12%, GS roughli 9% and JPM anoth 8%. Again, the gain are somewhat concentrated; over 40% of the Dow' year-to-d increas is come from just these four stocks.Still, like in the S&P 500, the gain are broad-based. Onli four Dow compon are in the red in 2017, includ the two energi issues.Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) both have declin in 2017. But the 7% increas YTD ha come in larg part from just a few stock - and, like the S&P 500, the same is true sinc November.Appl and the Nasdaq-100Th Nasdaq-100 is a tech titan-heavi index. Thus, it should be no surpris that AAPL stock ha a major weight in the index. Appl repres almost 12% of the Nasdaq-100 - the year' best-perform major index so far, with an increas just under 11%.Appl stock ha been the major driver, account for over 20% of that growth.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha ad anoth 9%, as ha AMZN.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Some 40% of the index' YTD gain have come from those three stocks. And they haven't had as much help from their fellow tech titans.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) actual have lag the Nasdaq-100 so far thi year. That might be a good thing if those stock pick up the pace - but it doe leav the index somewhat reliant on just a few key issues.Of course, that' the natur of the Nasdaq-100, rel to the S&P 500 in particular, which ha more stock and a broader mandate.But no matter the index, Appl stock is important. And that just show how embed it is in the U.S. invest world. Pretti much everi index ha signific exposur to AAPL - which mean that most diversifi investor own Appl in some way, shape or form.Th strength in the broad market in 2017 hasn't come sole from AAPL stock - but it ha helped.

How the Dogs of the Dow Are Faring in the Market Rally,3/2/2017,"TheDow Jone Industrials(DJINDICES: ^DJI) have been on fire so far in 2017, set new all-tim record on more than a dozen occas in the first two month of the year and climb abov the 21,000 level for the first time on March 1. Yet rather than invest in the entir Dow, some dividend investor follow a strategi known as the Dog of the Dow, which involv pick just a hand of the compon that make up the vener average. Two month in and after a huge rally, now' a good time to check in and see how the Dog of the Dow are fare and what explain their perform in 2017.How the Dog of the Dow are fare in 2017To find out which stock make up the Dog of the Dow, you just have to do one simpl thing. Pick the 10 stock as of the end of 2016 that had the highest dividend yields, and then buy share of them in equal dollar amounts. Then, hold onto all 10 stock throughout the year.So far in 2017, the Dog of the Dow are lag slightli behind the Dow overall. On average, the Dog are up 5%, compar to a nearli 7% return for the unmodifi Dow.makeArticleAd();Th biggest reason for the poor perform from the Dog of the Dow is that three of the 10 stock the strategi track have lost ground in 2017, compar to just five overal for the Dow 30. The biggest loser ha beenExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) , which ha had to deal with renew concern about whether the energi market can keep claw back more of the ground that they lost dure the plung in crudeoil pricesin 2015.Chevron(NYSE: CVX) ha also produc year-to-d loss for similar reasons. In addition,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) ha had to deal with new price-war considerations, includ the potenti merger of it No. 3 and No. 4 rival in the U.S. wireless telecom industry, and is also react advers to threat of higher interest rates.Anoth reason for underperform is that the Dog didn't get to includ the year' best perform so far.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha jump more than 20%, carri forward momentum from 2016 as investor have regain confid in the company' long-term prospects. Even though some investor worri that a lack of innov new product in Apple' visibl pipelin pose a long-term threat to the growth of the business, the compani ha still been abl to use the iPhone' success and the loyalti toward it ecosystem to drive business.Don't count the Dog outThat said, the Dog of the Dow have had their share of success stories.Cisco SystemsandMerckhav risen by double-digit percentages, but the most import winner so far in 2017 ha beenBoeing(NYSE: BA) , which ha climb 18% sinc the begin of the year. Call from the Trump administr to increas defens spend have help push the aerospac and defens giant higher, and a strong commerci aerospac market continu to make investor optimist about Boeing. Yet even here, the Dog of the Dow haven't benefit as much as the Dow 30, becaus Boeing' high share price ha produc outsiz gain for the averag but not for the equal-weight Dogs.Mor importantly, it' still earli in the year. The Dog of the Dow tend to move in a manner similar to a value-bas strategy, reward stock that have lag in the past. That' veri muchnotth way that the stock market ha act lately, instead ride posit momentum from late 2016 and continu to reward earlier winner rather than creat a rotat of new gainers.In particular, the Dog includ sever stock that could benefit greatli from anticip growth in certain sectors.Caterpillarin particular is well pois to boost it profit in North America if construct and infrastructur activ rise go forward. Pharmaceut stock have gotten hit hard recently, but if healthcar reform avoid major pressur to their profit, then the share could rebound and help the Dog to a greater extent than they would the overal Dow 30.The Dog of the Dow are lag slightli behind the overal Dow, but that doesn't mean that the strategi is a bad one to use. A lot can happen over the rest of 2017, and you should watch close to see if the Dog of the Dow can catch up and surpass the Dow 30 in the month to come.10 stock we like better than BoeingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Are These 2 Tech Titans Trading at a Huge Discount?,3/2/2017,"Sometim Mr. Market get confus and price compani at a premium or discount to their true value. While big compani such asApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andVerizon(NYSE: VZ) histor trade at a discount to the overal market, they'r current trade at an even deeper discount than usual.Verizon' share price ha mostli stood still while the market continu to ralli over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is trade around the same P/E ratio as it did at the begin of last year, while the S&P 500 is trade 21% higher on a P/E basis. Let' look at the number and see whi both these tech titan are trade at massiv discounts.Wal Street might be miss someth on these two. Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Verizon' 15-year lowVerizon' P/E ratio for the trail 12 month is a mere 15.5. On a forward basis, it' just 12.9. That compar with the S&P 500' trail P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trade at just 0.58 time the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it wa even below 0.65 wa in 2002, when the telecom industri tanked, accord to analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.Historically, Verizon trade for just an 11% discount. The 42% discount it' trade at today repres a massiv buy opportun for long-term valu investor -- not to mention that Verizon is also trade at a lower forward P/E compar withAT&T(NYSE: T) , which trade for 14.3 time analysts' 2017 EP estimates.At the same time, it' worth look at whi Mr. Market is place such a hefti discount on the wireless carrier.First and foremost, the competit in the wireless industri is increasingli fierce. Pressur fromT-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS) ha final gotten to Verizon, put pressur on it pricing. Verizon recent introduc an unlimited-data plan in an effort to compet with the valu offer by T-Mobile' plans. AT&T also bow to the pressure, open it unlimited-data plan to all custom and drop the price.Imag source: Verizon.However, the strength of Verizon' wireless network and it posit on the lead edg of 5G network develop give it a signific competit advantag over the long term. Additionally, it massiv retail custom base -- the largest in the U.S. wireless industri -- will continu to throw off cash for it invest in it wireless network and digit advertis and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward it usual valuat level over time.In the meantime, investor can get a juici 4.6% dividend for their patience.Apple' recent run may be just the startShar of Appl have been on a tear over the last nine months, increas 46%. That significantli outpac the 14% increas the S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Appl wa trade for a 35% discount on a P/E basi in 2015 and a 26% discount in 2016.The largest compani in the market typic trade for a discount to the S&P 500, but not nearli as deep as Apple's. Over the past 10 years, the averag discount for the largest compani by market cap wa 16% to the S&P 500' P/E, accord to BMO Capital' Tim Long. Appl share trade near that level in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the explos in earn from the releas of the iPhon 6 at the end of 2014.Today, Appl trade around a 25% discount to the S&P 500, below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple' slow iPhon sale growth, there are a few reason to believ Apple' earn will continu to expand.Th iPhon 7 Plus. Imag source: AppleFirst of all, the compani continu to execut on it massiv capit return program. Share buyback will forc earn per share to increas at a faster rate than net income.Second, Apple' servic busi continu to grow at a strong pace.Servic revenu is higher margin than Apple' core revenue.A such, it ha an outsiz impact on Apple' profit growth.Investor look for valu have two great option with Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trade at an all-tim high, it still ha room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trade at histor low while maintain strong competit advantages, indic it should outpac the market from here.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Timeless Lessons From the 2017 DJCO Meeting – Part I,3/2/2017,"As we all know, Warren Buffett andCharli Munger(Trades,Portfolio) hold theBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) sharehold meet in Omaha, Nebraska, everi year. Dure the past two year there were more than 40,000 peopl who attend the meeting. Most peopl attend the Berkshir meet as an annual pilgrimag as well as a get-togeth with fellow valu investor friends.Bi contrast there were onli about 400 peopl who attend theDaili Journal Corp.(DJCO) meeting, or approxim 1% that of the Berkshir meeting. The DJCO meet is also held in the middl of the week, not the weekend. Therefore, for those who are not in Lo Angeles, it is a veri time-consum effort. For me, it is a rare opportun to pay tribut to the great Charli Munger as well as to connect with a veri intellig group of investors.Thi year mark my fourth time to particip in the Daili Journal sharehold meeting. All the question were high quality. After the meeting, Munger unexpectedli and gener stay for an extra three hour to answer question with a small group of cult members. Today I'd like to share a few observ and thought from the 2017 DJCO meeting.makeArticleAd();First of all, and thi is almost the theme of thi year' meeting, Munger repeatedli stress the import of defer gratification. For most people, defer gratif is hard to practic but if you can, your life will be different. Munger' success ha a lot to do with defer gratification. He cite a few examples. For instance, China' success is larg through defer gratif - when the Chines were poor, they manag to save half of the incom to invest for the future. They rare got a chanc to enjoy anything, but boy did that lead to the prosper of hundr of million of Chinese.Anoth exampl of defer gratif is how medic student eventu becom doctors. We all know that in the U.S. it is a long journey to becom a doctor - you have to work hard for mani year to becom one. Munger said that, compar with deriv traders, he prefer to be associ with doctors.Below are a few direct quot from Munger.""I live my whole life with peopl who have defer gratification; they don't have fun, but they get wealthy. You end up with a lot of rich dead peopl - what good is that? But it doe work. Your grave will look nice to outsid and incit a lot of envy.""""I have a differ feel than the rest of America. I wish we weren't produc all thi natur gas. I'd be delight to just have it lie there untap for decad in the futur and pay extra onc Arab use up their oil. Our reserv not go away are like retain the topsoil of Iowa. You wouldn't ship the topsoil to Greenland. There' not enough defer gratif to sell our oil. Same for chemic feedstock - use them slowly. I am sure I am right and the other 99% of the peopl are wrong. Nobodi els in America seem to feel my way, but I believ in defer gratification.""On good thing about what we'r do is that it' slow, but onc you succeed it' veri sticki business, and the fact that it' difficult to do mean it' difficult for peopl to chang much - if you slog through, it' a big market and the peopl have no option but to charg ahead - the fact that' it' so aw to grind through mean peopl may not want to get in.""Second, Buffett and Munger are except ration and adaptive. We all know that Munger gave a speech on human psycholog misjudgments. One of the misjudg is commit and consist bias. It is our natur to adher to our pre-establish view and if we shout it out in public, we pound it in. Over the past few decades, Buffett and Munger have consist express the view that the airlin have the worst busi model and that technolog stock are outsid their circl of competency. But when the situat changed, they chang their point of view by invest heavili in airlin and technolog stock such asApple(AAPL) andIBM(IBM).What' more admir is how their view on airlin and Appl changed. The idea were brought by Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. They were abl to convinc Buffett and Munger to take anoth look at the airlin and Appl from anoth angl and they did. Munger also said that the invest in airlin is not a cinch but when the competit environ ha changed, they made a decis to adapt.""If you'r in a game and learn more and hone skills, of cours you do better over time. Berkshir would be a veri modest compani if Warren never learn anything. We went out and bought whole entir busi - someth we'd not have done earli on as stock investors. And Iscar at five time book value, Ben Graham would'v never bought that. We'v learn better over time, and we can keep learn and are still do it. He' chang when he' buy airlines, and he' chang when he' buy Apple. The nice thing about the game we'r in is that we can keep learning. We'r in the press for airlin stock when in 2013 we thought it wa a joke, it wa such a terribl business. Today, if you put all our hold together, we own a small airline. It violat the total catechism. It' the same thing for railroad scare us away with all thi truck competit - it wa a terribl busi for 80 years, and then we becom a massiv owner when they final got it down to four main railroads. Thi morn I wa with my daughter-in-law, and she bought round-trip ticket to Europ for $400 with tax - huh [aghast at how cheap it was]? Mayb we shouldn't be in the airlin stocks. I frequent talk to Warren about the old days. We shot fish in a barrel. We even wait until they slow down and use a shotgun. We get littl edg now while befor had total cinches. But it isn't ani less interesting. We boughtExxonMobil(XOM) as a cash substitut - we thought it'd do a littl better than cash at the time - but earli on we never would'v done that. Think what chang when we bought Appl with the hoot we'v done about high tech. 'Appl and a bunch of airlines' is now a lead stori about us in the press. But we'r just adapt to a busi that' gotten a lot more difficult. I don't think we'v gone crazy. I think we'r adapting. Now the odd are just a littl in our favor. We'll take that advantage, but it' harder. You marri the best person who will have you. Be satisfi with the type of advantag we didn't use to get, caus by get so enorm rich - it' not a bad trade-off.""Mung also emphas the import of patienc and be prepared. The best opportun are rare and transient so we have to be patient and be prepar to seiz these opportunities. Munger gave us an inspir example. He had been read Barron' magazin for more than 50 year and onli found one good idea from Barron' articles. It wa a ridicul cheap auto part company. Munger bought the junk bond as well as the common stock at the cost of about $1 a share. He held for a few year and sold them at $15 per share for a total of profit of $80 million. And then he met Li Lu and thought Li Lu wa veri unusual. Li Lu also onli invest in China, which is a much less effici market. Munger gave Li Lu the $80 million profit he made from the auto part compani and Li Lu turn thi into $400 million. Essenti through two investments, Munger turn a few million into $400 million. Thi exampl illustr the import of patience, defer gratif and concentration.Mor to come in my next article.Start afre seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

CFO Brett Bigg said""anyth that would potenti rais price for our custom in the U.S. is a concern for us.""Should ani such tax come to fruition, the compani would be forc to either eat the increas cost or pass them on to consumers.Biggs' comment came just after the compani report it fourth-quart earn results. Compar store sale grew 1.8%, the strongest growth sinc Juli 2012 and tenth consecut month of year-to-year improvement. Revenu guidanc for the current quarter and fiscal year were abov consensu and e-commerc sale grew 29%.

Amazon' impress growth isn't over yet. Nor are the breakneck gain in AMZN stock.Her are three reason why.E-Commerc Is Just Get StartedIt might seem like e-commerc ha complet taken over the retail space as more and more store abandon their brick-and-mortar format and shift toward onlin selling. However,data from the Censu Bureaushow the industri is still in the earli stages. In the fourth quarter of 2016, e-commerc sale made up just 8.3% of total retail sales. So yes, e-commerc is expand rapidly, but there' so, so much room for compani like Amazon to expand.And AMZN is well-suit to grab thi market share becaus it still continu to look for new way to expand it offerings. Amazon ha recent push it way into clothing, food delivery, flower delivery, and even hand-mad goods.Th firm' dedic to becom a one-stop shop for everyth a person might shop for onlin is impress and suggest that AMZN stock will continu to push forward.Growth in the CloudPerhap the most compel reason to put AMZN stock in the growth categori is the firm' cloud comput arm, Amazon Web Servic (AWS).7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Amazon ha alreadi establish itself as the No. 1 player in the cloud comput market, which itself is on it way to becom a massiv industry. The company' posit bode well for futur growth.Amazon Web Servic ha been expand exponenti on a yearli basi - the firm'sfourth-quart resultsshow that AW sale were up 47% from a year earlier and $300 million from the quarter before. That is some jaw-drop growth.AW still onli make up about 8% of Amazon' overal revenue, but it' a powder keg for profit thank to it high-margin natur - exactli whi some were worri aboutAWS' recent outage.Consid the low-margin natur of the rest of Amazon' businesses, Amazon Web Services' growth is critic to AMZN stock.Brick-and-Mortar FootprintWhil it may seem counterintuitive, brick-and-mortar retail is anoth place where AMZN could drive some big-tim growth.Amazon is work to increas it physic presenc with new store format that allow custom to come in for a physic - but still unorthodox - shop experience.On of AMZN' most promis brick-and-mortar ventur isAmazon Go- a physic store that boast no line and no checkouts.Custom download the Amazon Go app and then are free to enter the store and choos whatev item they want. Amazon ha develop ""Just Walk Out Technology"" which is abl to detect what product have been taken or return to shelves. That mean when custom are ready, they can simpli walk out of the store and their Amazon account will be charged.Amazon Go is still in the earli stages, but if it roll out more broadly, it could creat a brand-new type of shop experience.Whi Appl Inc.

The compani ha been work for year tri to put togeth an onlin TV service, hope to offer 25 channel for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seem to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcast couldn't reach an agreement on price.But Alphabet ha just succeed where Appl failed.YouTub TV - live TV from over 40 provid includ the big network for $35 per month - is now official.YouTub TV Take on CableYouTub TVwa announc on Tuesday.

It rival beat it to the punch with the stream TV bundl it had envis offer with the Appl TV.What make it even more gall is how close YouTub TV is to what AAPL wa negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCB Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talk about a subscript Appl televis stream service, butmoney wa reportedli a stick point. In Decemb of that year, CB CEO Le Moonv confirm toBusi Insiderthat hi network had been in talk with Apple, and were close to settl on a monthli price to charg consumers. Moonv wa throw around $35 - exactli the price that YouTub TV is charging.Appl balked.

Applehir the former head of Amazon' Fire TVto take over as the head of market for Appl TV. Thi move ha rais expect that AAPL will revamp it Appl TV hardware.

If the compani can accomplish that goal, it still can posit an Appl televis stream servic as be someth unique.With YouTub TV, Googl may have beaten Appl to the punch when it come to be first of the tech giant to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is like just beginning.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Appl Inc.

Berkshire Hathaway: Repurchase Limit Crosses $135 Per Share,3/1/2017,"In addit to the releas ofWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)' sharehold letter thi past weekend,Berkshir Hathaway(BRK.A) (BRK.B) report full-year fiscal 2016 financi result as well - so let' dive in.Berkshir report $24 billion in net incom in 2016, compar to 2015. On 2.466 billion equival B shares, that' equal to roughli $9.75 per share in 2016 report earnings.I person make a few adjust to tri and normal these results. First, I larg back out the roughli $6.7 billion in invest and deriv gain includ in net incom (replac by roughli $2.3 billion in income, which is equal to ~50% of the trail five-year average). Second, I add back unreport earn from the ""Big Five"" -The Coca-Cola Co.(KO),American Express(AXP),Wel Fargo(WFC),IBM(IBM) andApple(AAPL); by my math, there wa roughli $3.1 billion (aftertax) in unreport earn from these five hold (the Appl stake is adjust to reflect the disclosur Buffett made Monday morn on CNBC). Finally, I make a few other adjust that I believ are reason (most notabl an estim of earn power on the excess cash Berkshir hold and higher depreci expens at BNSF to account for the real mainten cost attribut to the railroad). All in, my math estim that Berkshir Hathaway' normal earn power is approach $10 per B share.makeArticleAd();For the full year, Berkshir gener $32.5 billion in cash flow from oper (a decad ago that number wa ~$10 billion). Roughli $13 billion wa reinvest in the busi as capit expenditur with $5.1 billion and $3.8 billion spent at Berkshir Hathaway Energi and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Anoth $31.4 billion wa spent on acquisit (largelyPrecis Castparts[PCP] but also $1.4 billion for bolt-on acquisitions). The net shortfal from these three bucket (roughli $12 billion) wa cover by increment long-term debt issu at low single-digit interest rates.Insur businessesBerkshire' insur busi report a pretax underwrit gain of ~$2.1 billion in 2016, an increas of 16% from 2015. The gain wa attribut to Berkshir Hathaway Reinsur Group, where underwrit incom nearli doubled, to $822 million. Within BHRG, ""Retroact Reinsurance"" loss declin from $469 million to $49 million. It' difficult to say anyth meaning base on headlin chang in the report reinsur result from year to year. As an example, the retroact reinsur agreement recent sign withAmerican Intern Group(AIG) - for which Berkshir receiv a premium of $10 billion- will gener $375 million in pretax defer charg amort loss for BHRG in 2017. Focus onli on the loss without consid the econom of the whole deal lead you to faulti conclusions.GEICO had anoth solid year of growth in 2016, with earn premium up 12%. For the year, GEICO ad nearli 1 million net auto polici in forc (PIFs), compar to a net 700,000 addit in 2015. While the loss ratio increas in 2016, pressur profits, thi is a reason trade-off in the short term (it' worth note that storm-rel loss at GEICO increas by $260 million in 2016 as well). GEICO ha a sustain competit advantag that becom more power in an environ where consum are increasingli cost conscious. Manag ha proven adept at manag the busi for the long-term. GEICO will emerg from the industry' current challeng in a stronger posit than it started.Berkshir Hathaway Primari Group continu to report solid number as well, with earn premium increas to $6.3 billion in 2016 (up more than 40% from 2014). The combin ratio wa just shi of 90%, result in more than $650 million in pretax underwrit income.At the end of 2016, the float attribut to Berkshire' insur busi exceed $91 billion (compar to $70 billion five years). Inclus of the AIG deal discuss a moment ago, Berkshire' float exce $100 billion. In hi letter, Buffett restat hi belief that a declin in float, should it occur, will be veri gradual - ""at the outsid no more than 3% per year.""Noninsur businesses2016 wa a tough year for rail gener and BNSF specifically, with revenu fall 10% on compar declin in volum and averag revenu per car. The coal busi took a beat in 2016, with volum and revenu down 21% and 27%, respectively; even after declin by more than one-quarter, the coal busi still account for ~17% of BNSF' revenu in 2016. The oper ratio increas in the face of slide revenu (mean lower oper margins), result in a 16% drop in earnings. 2016 wa undoubtedli a struggl for BNSF; if guidanc fromUnion Pacific(UNP) is ani indication, 2017 should be a step in the right direction.Berkshir Hathaway Energi report $17.9 billion in 2016 revenues, a low single-digit declin from 2015. A small increas in pretax incom end up as a 7% increas in aftertax profits, partli attribut to a lower effect tax rate (down two point to 14%). There' plenti of room to run here: my research suggest product tax credit from wind-pow electr gener will be a materi tailwind to BHE' net incom over the come year (MidAmerican own more wind-pow capac than ani other rate-regul electr util in the country).Berkshire' Manufacturing, Servic and Retail (MSR) busi report ~$5.6 billion in earn in 2016, an increas of ~$1 billion versu the prior year (both measur exclud amort of intangibles). The entireti of the gain came from the Manufactur bucket due to the inclus of Precis Castparts; pretax Manufactur earn declin in 2016 whenPrecis Castpart is back out (larg due to a $365 million loss from the disposit of part of Lubrizol' busi in the fourth quarter). MSR wa also impact by other one-tim costs, such as $110 million in acquisition/integr and transit cost from the Duracel deal.Finally, Financ & Financi Product revenu increas 10% in 2016, with earn up 4%. Clayton Homes' report a solid year, sell more than 42,000 unit (an impress 25% increas from 2015). Strength in manufactur home from Clayton offset less impress result in the remaind of the busi (notabl at Marmon).ConclusionBook valu increas by ~11% in 2016 to $115 per B share (trail three-year CAGR of 8%). The repurchas author (up to 120% of book value) enabl Buffett to buy back stock at ~$138 per B share. As he note in the sharehold letter, ""purchas at that level clearli bring an instant and materi benefit to continu shareholders"". Start at ~$170 per share, that would requir a pullback of ~20%. Share are reason valu at current levels.Berkshire' fortress balanc sheet continu to offer signific optionality; at some unknown point in the future, it will be use to creat meaning per-shar valu for investors.

Simpli by offer it search engin and Googl Play store through the software, GOOGL rake in billion of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extrem fragmented.

Reviews, however, have been mixed. The compani is even tri to getback into Chinathrough it OEM (the world' largest market toss Googl back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Googl ha it work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) domin the Android market. OEM and consum see thi fragment as an advantage, even though it allow bug to multipli becaus they may appear on one devic or brand only.Th oper system itself is hopelessli fragmented. Googl is onli now roll out it Marshmallow and Nougat version of Android andstil develop the ""O"" version, while mani user have devic that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone run on Lollipop, (simpli becaus it lack the storag to run anyth newer).Th way Googl eventu get it arm around all of thi may be throughAndromeda, an oper system for both Android and it laptop Chromebook devices. Unifi softwar platform would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft onli dream of with it Window oper system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monet Android, would investor even notice?Alphabet continu to grow at 20% per year, power by advertis on it main Search site and YouTube. The compani bring approxim 25 cent of everi dollar to the net incom line, it balanc sheet carri almost no debt, and oper cash flow is ridicul ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achiev just two year prior).

The company' market cap of $577 billion trail onli that of Apple. Six month ago,they were nearli level, but that wa befor Apple' recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat' program of pare non-perform asset and forc ""other bets"" (like the company' self-driv car unit, now call Waymo) to make it on their own ha paid off. Google' invest balanc have been grow steadily, along with it asset base.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Will Becom a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat' most amaz is how Alphabet continu to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Googl Cloud is often consid third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Googl wa late to the voic parti with Googl Assistant, which allow Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardwar line is load with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL lead in precis zero categories.Still, Porat ha perform well in provid disciplin to Googl executives, but she ha not propel Alphabet to market leadership outsid of Search.If asset such as Android becam true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on it way to $1,000 per share and becom the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

It rival beat it to the punch with the stream TV bundl it had envis offer with the Appl TV.What make it even more gall is how close YouTub TV is to what AAPL wa negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCB Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talk about a subscript Appl televis stream service, butmoney wa reportedli a stick point. In Decemb of that year, CB CEO Le Moonv confirm toBusi Insiderthat hi network had been in talk with Apple, and were close to settl on a monthli price to charg consumers.

Berkshire Hathaway: Repurchase Limit Crosses $135 Per Share,3/1/2017,"In addit to the releas ofWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)' sharehold letter thi past weekend,Berkshir Hathaway(BRK.A) (BRK.B) report full-year fiscal 2016 financi result as well - so let' dive in.Berkshir report $24 billion in net incom in 2016, compar to 2015. On 2.466 billion equival B shares, that' equal to roughli $9.75 per share in 2016 report earnings.I person make a few adjust to tri and normal these results. First, I larg back out the roughli $6.7 billion in invest and deriv gain includ in net incom (replac by roughli $2.3 billion in income, which is equal to ~50% of the trail five-year average). Second, I add back unreport earn from the ""Big Five"" -The Coca-Cola Co.(KO),American Express(AXP),Wel Fargo(WFC),IBM(IBM) andApple(AAPL); by my math, there wa roughli $3.1 billion (aftertax) in unreport earn from these five hold (the Appl stake is adjust to reflect the disclosur Buffett made Monday morn on CNBC). Finally, I make a few other adjust that I believ are reason (most notabl an estim of earn power on the excess cash Berkshir hold and higher depreci expens at BNSF to account for the real mainten cost attribut to the railroad). All in, my math estim that Berkshir Hathaway' normal earn power is approach $10 per B share.makeArticleAd();For the full year, Berkshir gener $32.5 billion in cash flow from oper (a decad ago that number wa ~$10 billion). Roughli $13 billion wa reinvest in the busi as capit expenditur with $5.1 billion and $3.8 billion spent at Berkshir Hathaway Energi and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Anoth $31.4 billion wa spent on acquisit (largelyPrecis Castparts[PCP] but also $1.4 billion for bolt-on acquisitions). The net shortfal from these three bucket (roughli $12 billion) wa cover by increment long-term debt issu at low single-digit interest rates.Insur businessesBerkshire' insur busi report a pretax underwrit gain of ~$2.1 billion in 2016, an increas of 16% from 2015. The gain wa attribut to Berkshir Hathaway Reinsur Group, where underwrit incom nearli doubled, to $822 million. Within BHRG, ""Retroact Reinsurance"" loss declin from $469 million to $49 million. It' difficult to say anyth meaning base on headlin chang in the report reinsur result from year to year. As an example, the retroact reinsur agreement recent sign withAmerican Intern Group(AIG) - for which Berkshir receiv a premium of $10 billion- will gener $375 million in pretax defer charg amort loss for BHRG in 2017. Focus onli on the loss without consid the econom of the whole deal lead you to faulti conclusions.GEICO had anoth solid year of growth in 2016, with earn premium up 12%. For the year, GEICO ad nearli 1 million net auto polici in forc (PIFs), compar to a net 700,000 addit in 2015. While the loss ratio increas in 2016, pressur profits, thi is a reason trade-off in the short term (it' worth note that storm-rel loss at GEICO increas by $260 million in 2016 as well). GEICO ha a sustain competit advantag that becom more power in an environ where consum are increasingli cost conscious. Manag ha proven adept at manag the busi for the long-term. GEICO will emerg from the industry' current challeng in a stronger posit than it started.Berkshir Hathaway Primari Group continu to report solid number as well, with earn premium increas to $6.3 billion in 2016 (up more than 40% from 2014). The combin ratio wa just shi of 90%, result in more than $650 million in pretax underwrit income.At the end of 2016, the float attribut to Berkshire' insur busi exceed $91 billion (compar to $70 billion five years). Inclus of the AIG deal discuss a moment ago, Berkshire' float exce $100 billion. In hi letter, Buffett restat hi belief that a declin in float, should it occur, will be veri gradual - ""at the outsid no more than 3% per year.""Noninsur businesses2016 wa a tough year for rail gener and BNSF specifically, with revenu fall 10% on compar declin in volum and averag revenu per car. The coal busi took a beat in 2016, with volum and revenu down 21% and 27%, respectively; even after declin by more than one-quarter, the coal busi still account for ~17% of BNSF' revenu in 2016. The oper ratio increas in the face of slide revenu (mean lower oper margins), result in a 16% drop in earnings. 2016 wa undoubtedli a struggl for BNSF; if guidanc fromUnion Pacific(UNP) is ani indication, 2017 should be a step in the right direction.Berkshir Hathaway Energi report $17.9 billion in 2016 revenues, a low single-digit declin from 2015. A small increas in pretax incom end up as a 7% increas in aftertax profits, partli attribut to a lower effect tax rate (down two point to 14%). There' plenti of room to run here: my research suggest product tax credit from wind-pow electr gener will be a materi tailwind to BHE' net incom over the come year (MidAmerican own more wind-pow capac than ani other rate-regul electr util in the country).Berkshire' Manufacturing, Servic and Retail (MSR) busi report ~$5.6 billion in earn in 2016, an increas of ~$1 billion versu the prior year (both measur exclud amort of intangibles). The entireti of the gain came from the Manufactur bucket due to the inclus of Precis Castparts; pretax Manufactur earn declin in 2016 whenPrecis Castpart is back out (larg due to a $365 million loss from the disposit of part of Lubrizol' busi in the fourth quarter). MSR wa also impact by other one-tim costs, such as $110 million in acquisition/integr and transit cost from the Duracel deal.Finally, Financ & Financi Product revenu increas 10% in 2016, with earn up 4%. Clayton Homes' report a solid year, sell more than 42,000 unit (an impress 25% increas from 2015). Strength in manufactur home from Clayton offset less impress result in the remaind of the busi (notabl at Marmon).ConclusionBook valu increas by ~11% in 2016 to $115 per B share (trail three-year CAGR of 8%). The repurchas author (up to 120% of book value) enabl Buffett to buy back stock at ~$138 per B share. As he note in the sharehold letter, ""purchas at that level clearli bring an instant and materi benefit to continu shareholders"". Start at ~$170 per share, that would requir a pullback of ~20%.

Simpli by offer it search engin and Googl Play store through the software, GOOGL rake in billion of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extrem fragmented.

OEM and consum see thi fragment as an advantage, even though it allow bug to multipli becaus they may appear on one devic or brand only.Th oper system itself is hopelessli fragmented. Googl is onli now roll out it Marshmallow and Nougat version of Android andstil develop the ""O"" version, while mani user have devic that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone run on Lollipop, (simpli becaus it lack the storag to run anyth newer).Th way Googl eventu get it arm around all of thi may be throughAndromeda, an oper system for both Android and it laptop Chromebook devices. Unifi softwar platform would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft onli dream of with it Window oper system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monet Android, would investor even notice?Alphabet continu to grow at 20% per year, power by advertis on it main Search site and YouTube. The compani bring approxim 25 cent of everi dollar to the net incom line, it balanc sheet carri almost no debt, and oper cash flow is ridicul ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achiev just two year prior).

The company' market cap of $577 billion trail onli that of Apple.

Google' invest balanc have been grow steadily, along with it asset base.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Will Becom a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat' most amaz is how Alphabet continu to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Googl Cloud is often consid third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft.

"3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has Plenty More Upside",3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsNot long ago,Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) wa consid a has-been. But of course, the rumor of the company' death have been, well, greatli exaggerated. Consid that AMD stock ha skyrocket 600% dure the past 12 months.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrNow the compani is suddenli part of the hot crowd of chip operators, such asNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, AMD stock wa abl to outpac the company. After all, for the past year, NVDA stock ha log a gain of 220%.OK, so what can we expect with AMD stock go forward? Can it sustain the gains?I think so. Granted, the return will probabl not necessarili be in the tripl digits. What' more, you should expect quit a bit of volatility.But for the most part, AMD stock still should catch lot of fire. Let' see why:Reason No. 1 for AMD Stock: LeadershipWhen it come to the technolog world, it' critic that the CEO have the right blend of technic skill and busi acumen. Just look at Steve Job atAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) Mark Zuckerberg.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017So as for the case of Advanc Micro Devices, it look like the compani ha a CEO who fit the bill: Lisa Su. Sinc take the helm a coupl years, she ha been impecc with her strateg move and strong focu on disciplin execution.But then again, she ha the right background to lead a compani like AMD. Sheholdsa bachelor's, master' and doctor degre in electr engin from MIT. Oh, and she ha author over 40 technic papers. Yet along the way, Su ha serv at executive-level posit at compani likeFreescal Semiconductor Ltd(NYSE:FSL) andIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM).Reason No. 2 for AMD Stock: Product InnovationUntil recently, the phrase ""product innovation"" and Advanc Micro Devic were usual not use in the same sentence! The compani usual had a vagu product strategi and seem more concern about focus on nich markets.But all thi ha chang - and fast. For thi year, AMD plan to launch three major product line - all of which are target major market opportunities. Now, the detail are a bit vague, but it doe look like AMD will have standout offer that should move the needl in term of revenu and profits.Consid that thi week, AMD will offici launch three Ryzen chip for game systems. And for the highest perform one, the price tag will behalf-off comparedto a compar chip from rivalIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Seem like a no-brain that thi will gin up lot of demand, right?Definitely.But the real traction is like to come from the Napl line of chips, which will focu on the datacenter. Keep in mind that AMD ha less than 1% of the market. In other words, there is tremend potenti for upside.Th good news is that Napl is also like to have strong perform - in term of speed and power effici - rel to INTC, which current ha much of the marketshar for the datacenter.In light of the continu growth in cloud computing, there is like to be plenti of demand for an altern technology. Note that already, AMD ha land custom likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA), whichhosts35% of the websit in China.Finally, AMD plan to releas a chip call Vega, which leverag GPU technolog for cutting-edg categori like deep learn and AI (Artifici Intelligence). No doubt, thi will mean encroach on the turf of NVDA. Again, as with the server market, there will like be mani potenti custom that would consid an alternative, especi if the price is right.Reason No. 3 for AMD Stock: MomentumTrue, it appear that much about AMD stock hing on it product releases. And of course, these are far from guaranteed. Let' face it, for a mid-siz compani like AMD, it will not be easi to manag the complex of multipl offerings.But it is import to note that the compani ha alreadi shown an abil to execut - such as by beat Wall Street expectations. Take a look at the latestquarter. AMD post revenu of $1.11 billion, up 15.4%. Thi wa $40 million higher than the consensu forecast.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Will Becom a Trillion-Dollar CompanyTh guidanc wa also encouraging. AMD put out a forecast of revenu to rang from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Thi not onli beat the analysts' project of $964 but also impli an 18% growth rate, assum that the real number come in at the mid-point.But of course, for the rest of the year AMD will continu to launch product at a torrid pace. So all in all, there will be mani potenti catalyst to keep up the momentum. More importantly, the compani will be focus on some of the hottest categori of technology, which should mean quit a bit of buzz to pump up the valuat even more.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster,3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announc slightli lower same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and investor dump BBi stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrTh drop wa minor, less than 1%. But it wa unexpected, and miss analyst estim of a top-lin gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy report earn of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenu of $13.48 billion. Thi compar with earn of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenu of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjust profit of $1.95 per share easili beat estim of $1.67, revenu fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.Th revenu shortfal meant analyst threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retail such asMacy' Inc.(NYSE:M), with share down almost 5% earli Wednesday, to $42.40. Dure the Christma season, on Dec. 8, the share trade as high as $49.31.Were the analyst right, or did they just offer smart investor a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is thi just a case of Moore' Law in action?Great Expect for Best BuyBest Buy even trounc the higher earn whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswer all over the map, with some veri bearish about the company' abil to cut cost and other bullish on margins.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The Zack Metric Model note that BBi stock had beaten estim for four quarters, and that sharehold had been reward with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy wa post big gain in onlin sale - the so-cal ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zack wa expect an upsid surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy deliv one. And consid the sizabl beat, BBi share should'v rocket higher.But someth els is at play … and that someth is Moore' Law.Moore' Law Hit the Top LineMoore' Law, which turn 50 in 2015, wa describ byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-found Gordon Moor as an expect increas in circuit densiti on silicon, doubl everi 18 month ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been write for mani year now, Moore' Law alsoturn tradit econom on it head. Moore' Law is deflationary, and the deflationari impact grow with time, as integr circuit are incorpor into more and more things, and as the impact is compound by it use in variou ways.In the case of Best Buy, thi mean the product it sell lose valu as soon as they leav the factory, and the retail is under enorm pressur to get them out the door befor their valu disappears. Thi isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company' primari growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unafford just a few year ago - 5 feet wide on the diagon - is now avail at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen set just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still make money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and thi is true for all consum electronics. Whole categori that use to repres big profits, like back-up drives, DVD player and packag software, have disappear as consum find they can get and save file to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBi StockTh new administr want to whip deflat now and, by allow price hike on oil and other resources, they could achiev the goal. China, too, seem dedic to fight deflation, give rais to mani worker in a more competit market.Thi should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focus more on product like oven and wash machin that have mechan part which sometim break. A new round of high-end phone should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earn multipl of under 14, and a dividend yield 2.5% (that the compani is in a great posit to raise), BBi stock might be Best Buy' best bargain.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

"Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?",3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) buysMacy' Inc(NYSE:M). It' a crazi idea, right? AMZN stock ha bare budg over the past coupl of week sincereportssurfac that Canada'sHudson' Bay Co(OTCMKTS:HBAYF) wa in talk to buy America' largest seller of apparel. Clearly, investor aren't hold their breath.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh media, on the other hand, ha been busi specul on the odd of a compani like Amazon get into a bid war with the icon Canadian retail that is run by an American and also ownsSak IncandLord & Taylor.Opinion vari on whether Amazon boss Jeff Bezo would make such a move, but let me assur you, it won't be for the real estate.No, if AMZN doe make a play for Macy' it will be for other, more-sens busi reasons. In fact, you could say Amazon would be take a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon' biggest rival in electron retail.How' that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you miss it, Amazon ha been slowli enter the apparel businesssinc debutingit own private-label brand in earli 2016 with 1,800 product avail for sale under name such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Societi New York.Essentially, it' tri to fill the gap not cover by it third-parti sellers. However, a bigger attract of do it own thing isn't lost on investor of AMZN stock, which is that you make more sell your own stuff than you do somebodi else's.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccord to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expect to pass Macy' in 2017 as America' top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.Whil it could do most of thi through it websites, have brick-and-mortar store ha alway been on the mind of analyst and retail expert alike.""W believ thi deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consum pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliv Chen in a recent report discuss the possibl of it buy Macy's. ""Amazon need better brands, a more curat assortment, a physic place to return items, and custom could use help with ensur fit - Macy' would also give Amazon greater credibl in curat and fashion authority.""That last part' a bit of stretch. I'm pretti sure if Amazon knock on your door and you'r a privat label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantag of it privat label expansion, real estat is go to becom an import part of the equat as AMZN expand into brick-and-mortar locations. It' not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abund of retail real estat come on stream through all the variou store close across America, including68 Macy' stores- part of the bigger 100 store close announc from last summer - in 2017, so find space isn't go to be a problem for AMZN.If you rememb what happen toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buy all those leas in one big deal ultim wa it undo becaus it put way too much pressur on it employe to execut such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it ha store across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decad or longer to execute. If it realli want to open retail store thi isn't an appropri solut for a growth compani like AMZN.Whi Best Buy?Busi wasn't look good for the Minneapolis-bas electron retail until CEO Hubert Joli turn the compani upsid down in 2012 implement it infam ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turn physic store locat into local distribut hub for it e-commerc business.Form CFO Sharon McCollamcal the ship-from-storein in Februari 2016 ""one of the most import and strateg decis in (Best Buy's) history.""Th number don't lie. In November, Best Buydeliv strongstrong Q3 2017 result that includ continu growth for it e-commerc busi along with posit same-stor sale growth. It' taken multi-channel retail to the next level.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Will Becom a Trillion-Dollar Company""Best Buy' third quarter onlin growth of over 24% result in a veri solid quarter, and continu to valid the company' multi-channel transformation,"" Moody' lead retail analyst Charli O'Sheasaid in November.Renew Blue' been such a success that retail expert Walter Loeb name Joli hi 2016 Retail of the Year.Bottom Line on AMZN StockBi acquir Macy's, AMZN would be abl to push it product onto the store floor where it could learn more about what apparel shopper want, while serious lower it ship expens by implement a ship-from-stor initi much like Best Buy.Yes, it' alreadi invest billion in warehous across the country, but get closer to the custom is never a bad thing; buy Macy' might not happen but if it does, it' got noth to do with own real estat and everyth to do with AMZN own the customer.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceElon Musk Is Drill a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockTh Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Ralli Is Near It End7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The postCould Amazon.com, Inc.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company,3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh market is make new high seemingli everi day. TheS&P 500,Nasdaq Compositeand other major indic are in unchart territory, and the stock that valu investor doubt is follow suit.Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is now worth $720 billion by market capitalization. And improbably, the $1 trillion mark - at $189 per share for AAPL stock, that' still a lofti 40% away - is at least in the realm of possibl now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlso improbably, Appl stock, at around 16 time earnings, is somewher between undervalu and fairli valued. Warren Buffett'sBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) still believ in the valu proposition, ad AAPL share in the most recent quarter, accord to Berkshire's13-F filing.Morgan Stanley ha rais it target price on AAPL stock to $154. UB say Appl share are worth $138. So the analyst are on board too.But $189?How Can Appl Hit $1 Trillion?If Appl trade at $189 per share without ani of it financi changing, that would assum a P/E that ha climb to about 22 time earnings. That higher multipl would have to reflect investor expect that iPhon 7 sale are growing, though more likely, that the iPhon 8 will be a smash hit.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017That' plausible, consid the woe ofSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi Note 7 fiasco, not to mention strong first-quart iPhon sales.Anoth way to look at it is through the revenu lens.Look ahead, Appl project second-quart revenu of between $51.5 billion-$53.5 billion and gross margin in the rang of 38%-39%. The $1 trillion market cap would valu the stock at 4 time sales, up from 3.3 times. And it seem unlik that investor would trade Appl to those kind of multipl without anyth els happening.Appl need iPhon sale to grow more than the 5% year-over-year figur last quarter. It certainli need iPad to revers a 19% YOY drop in revenue. Services, though, is a huge bright spot, grow revenu from 18% YOY, and the segment is acceler to becom a bigger piec of the revenu pie. Continu that track would certainli help AAPL' chances.iPhon 8 ReleaseTh biggest continu headlin thi year is Apple' 10th anniversari iPhon release, believ to be call either the iPhon 8 or theiPhon X.Currently, while the market is optimist about AAPL stock, it' not price in the potenti for double-digit revenu growth in iPhon sale on the back of iPhon 8. That would also includ revers the iPhone' slow sale in China.Anything' possibl in China right now, though.Xiaomi wa the leader in Chines smartphon market share in China in Q1 of 2015. In 2016, Huawei and Oppo took the first and second spot, respectively, in China. Apple' posit drop sharpli to thefifth spot. However, cut price of the iPhon 7 and promot that particular model in the region could help AAPL compet more effectively.Anoth Note About ValuationEven if Appl doesn't blow the door off with iPhon 8 sales, the market isn't against reward gigant tech titan without them boast breakneck growth.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trade at a P/E of 30 and P/ of 6.

What Warren Buffett Likes About Sirius XM (SIRI),3/1/2017,"Who would have thought Siriu XM (SIRI), which onc trade for pennies, would ever qualifi as a “Buffett stock?” But that’ precis the claim the New York-bas satellit radio station can now make.Accord to a recent regulatori file with the Secur and Exchang Commission, billionair investor Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshir Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), is now one of Siriu XM’ biggest fan after hi conglomer acquir 166.64 million Siriu share between Octob and Decemb 2016. Berkshire’ SIRI stake, which now stand at 741,547 shares, is wa worth in the neighborhood of $750 million.What doe Buffett see in SIRI?makeArticleAd();Onc left for dead at the height of the 2008 recession, Siriu XM, which ha a monopoli in the realm of automobil satellit radio, ha come roar back with a vengeance, thank to boom U.S. auto sale over the past coupl of years. SIRI stock, which close Tuesday at $5.09 per share, ha risen 38% over the past year, includ more than 14% year to date, best the S&P 500 index in both spans. And if you’v held SIRI stock of the past five years, you’r up 130%, or about 26% gain annually.Obviously, Buffett, who arguabl is the best valu investor of all time, would have love to have bought Siriu share much sooner. But the fact that he’ bought in now would suggest that he still see valu in the year ahead. Plus, Buffett is known to place hi long-term bet where he see strong manag teams. In that regard, the fact that Siriu ha post better-than-expect revenu for most of the last ten quarters, might have caught Buffett’ attention.Sirius’ streak of strong execut might have given Buffett the confid to allay fear about competit from the like of Apple’ (AAPL), which Buffett owns. Same goe for app like Spotify, Pandora (P), and so on. Over the past coupl of years, Siriu ha taken each new entrant’ best shot and not onli ha survived, it continu to gener ton of cash ($1.5 billion in FCF in 2016) and ha implement a dividend.In that regard, while 2017 auto sales, which Siriu reli on to grow it subscribers, may have a tough comp against 2016, Buffett is like look beyond 2017 and possibl other scenario that may work in Sirius’ favor. An acquisit by Apple, for example, which ha been rumor about for years, can’t be rule out. But until then, Buffett is go to ride Sirius’ cash cow and dividend for as long as he can. And retail investor should pay attention."
Nimble Storage: Why We Went Long,2/28/2017,"BySuhail Capital:W recent pick up some Nimbl Storag (NYSE:NMBL) shares. The posit is to a degre on the more specul side of thing for us as we have gener hate the flash storag vendor space and broader enterpris storag space for years, but as is alway the case in market at some point thing change.Th start point for thi thesi ha been our desir to look outsid of semiconductors/platform tech giants/and enterpris softwar for some appeal long in the broader technolog industry. Storag ha been that spot for us of late. We have dabbl sinc late last fall with outright invest in the like of Network Applianc (NASDAQ:NTAP) or even relat name with industri exposur like VMware (NYSE:VMW) on the softwar defin storag side or Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) as far as hyper converg vendor pure play go. But the oper word here is dabbled, as we have been reluct to commit to a bullish view on the sector.makeArticleAd();Whi have we been so reluctant?A Brief Trip Down Storag Memori LaneWell, in short the enterpris storag space ha been a notori bad place to be long anyth for a veri long time. In fact there hasn't been a true public success stori in the space sinc NTAP. And we defin success by a public billion + sale compani that is profit and actual gener return for shareholders. What the space ha instead offer up is a veri long list of fantast hype up short opportunities.Our experi here goe all the way back to STEC, a leader in the SSD market with what wa suppos to be game chang flash control technology, which in retrospect end up provid the script for all enterpris flash storag relat invest for year to come. Now we could probabl write a short stori about our experi with STEC as we initi bought into the hype disruptor pitch, befor quickli chang direct onc we got to know the manag and space. Whether it wa dodgi CEOs, mind-boggl relat parti transactions, insid trading, blue-chip custom name dropping, or crazi one-tim order that never ever rematerialized; STEC had it all. But as far as thi note is concern all that matter here is the stock and busi quickli collaps as the industri quickli shifted. Ultim STEC' technolog wa acquir for a fraction of it previou valu by [[WDC]].Naturally, the STEC experi made us veri wari of the next hot name in the space: Fusion-IO. Thi server side flash cach PCIe card compani which Facebook (FB) and Appl (AAPL) couldn't live without and with geniu Appl co-found Steve Wozniak as CTO wa an instant market darling. Fusion wa also a tough short becaus their busi didn't implod overnight. The demand for their technolog wa initi there, but over time the growth and margin didn't pan out as expect as the broader demand for flash cach never realli took off as expected. Why? Well, in our view the technolog becam more complimentari versu necessari as the afford all-flash array market took off. That be said, sell out to Sandisk at half it IPO price from a coupl year earlier end up be a far better final outcom than the next hot name in the space would face.Violin Memori burst on the scene as the all-flash array game changer that wa go to rock the storag market, but that unravel fairli quickli after HP dump them to focu on their own in hous 3par strategy. After problem with HP torpedo a $2bl plu dream IPO, Violin wa forc to float at all cost just to sustain the business. The stori wa spun some, but realli you didn't need to be a geniu to figur out thi wa a name to avoid. The subsequ IPO wa a flop, and the Violin model never got ani better. The consensu view on what went wrong here wa that Violin' custom memory-bas approach to it all-flash array solut vs. commod SSD wa what kill them, as the like of Pure Storag (PSTG) arriv in their space and larger storag provid like EMC got more aggressive. Either way, Violin went from IPO to Chapter 11 in 3 years. That' call a disaster, and yet here we are about to make a case for go long Nimbl Storage.A Littl Nimbl IPO HistoryNimble' IPO wa around the same time as Violin' disaster, but end up be an instant success. Share close up over 60% on the first day of trading, and within two month trade to a market valu of just under $5 billion and valuat of 50x ttm revenue. Naturally, we read the prospectu and sat back wait for a short opportunity, but at the time we were pretti busi with Veeva so couldn't do the detail work. Anyway, it didn't realli matter as a good chunk of the Nimbl bubbl burst in the Spring of 2014 with the rest of the tech IPO bubbl crowd. When we final got around to look close at the stock we had our fair share of doubts. The stori around Nimbl wa that Hybrid Array are simpler and cheaper than AFA and easier to manag softwar wise, and thu that it address market and growth opportun outsid of larg enterpris were extrem appealing. The bull case wa that the Enterpris AFA market would be left to the like of Pure and EMC XtremIO to battl over, while Nimbl actual got profit pretti quick with it commerci hybrid focus. That obvious hasn't pan out as the stock trade at roughli a quarter of it post-bubbl collaps level, ha a market cap of roughli 2x it ttm revenue.So whi do we like it now?Th Case For NimbleTh case for Nimbl obvious start with the valuation. At a current enterpris valu of roughli 1x expect 2017 revenu the stock is cheap, and trade at a discount to Pure Storage' multipl of 1.7x. Of course, in thi space valuat can be mislead as technolog can becom obsolet aw quick. So we are not realli valu hunt here in the tradit sense. In fact, we took a small posit in Nimbl call in front of it last earn as we want to express the view that it push into the AFA space wa working. Although the trade didn't work due to a seemingli sour market mood at the time, we were pleas with the confer call and quarterli results. Anyway, we have been keep a close eye on the name ever since. All we need to get a littl more comfort initi a posit in the stock wa evid that the sector in itself ha stabil enough, and that broader tech hardwar valuat could support a long case in the name. Well, we feel we hit that point recently. Specifically, the market headlin tick the box type of bottom event that the Violin Memori bankruptci provid in Decemb gave us confid that the cycl of sharehold valu destruct in thi space ha probabl come to an end. Thus, we got more comfort with test out our long thesi in the stock.Anyway, let' get a littl more detail here about what we were think thesi wise when we first start look at Nimble. The bear case on the name ha been pretti clear-cut. The short argument had been that Nimbl didn't play at all in the enterpris all flash array market, and that Pure Storage' launch of the M10 would start to eat away at their share in the commerci space. Thi take coupl with typic investor skeptic around custom rock softwar differenti for such a vendor, plu the fact that hyper converg player like Nutanix tend to be view as more of an initi threat to use case in Nimble' core market, made be bearish on the name not veri difficult. The argument essenti wa that Nimbl would gradual burn through it cash and never succeed as a stand-alon vendor.And to be clear on the surfac it wa pretti hard to argu with thi thesis, but then Nimbl complic thing even further by announc it entri into the all-flash array market. Thus, you now had to worri about it new product strategi failing, lead to an acceler cash burn and becom an unnecessari distract for manag in an alreadi extrem cut-throat competit environment. Basically, get readi for Violin Memori part deux. But here is the thing……It Strategi Worked.Nimbl ha quickli and brilliantli succeed with it move into the AFA space. It got to the $100 million annual book run rate in two quarters, and all the check with custom that we have done have been overwhelmingli positive. Consequently, Nimble' odd of surviv as a stand-alon vendor in the space have drastic improved. In fact, our main concern now is that the compani ha becom a glare takeov target at these level to just about half a dozen tech name with the resourc and justif to pay 50%+ premium to the current share price to acquir them. And yet the stock is trade like viabil go forward is still in question?How to Play ThisNimbl report it Q4 result next week and will guid on Q1. Consensu growth for next year is 22% while Pure' expect are for 39%. We think Nimbl is posit to outgrow consensu and Pure is more like to disappoint. So there is a nice pair trade here which look even nicer becaus of the signific valuat gap between the two, and the fact that Nimble' gain are like to come more and more at the expens of Pure. That be said, we think the current bull market in tech and glare takeov appeal for an opportunist suitor here make Nimbl an easi outright long posit for those who don't like to short/hedg with pairs.Se alsoCenterPoint Energy, Inc. 2016 Q4 - Result - Earn Call Slideson seekingalpha.com"

But noth is like to gener the sort of controversi AAPL stock is court with the latest rumor change. Accord toTh Wall Street Journal, the iPhon 8 will ditch Apple' proprietari Lightn cabl in favor of USB-C.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleWhat the WSJ Say About the iPhon 8The Wall Street Journalpublish a report thi morn outlin some of the key chang it feel arecom with the new iPhone.Most of the detail match previou specul on the device. That includ lose the Home button for an all-glass front. It' also call for a lofti $1,000 price point for the iPhon 8 - which it specul may end up go by the name of ""10th Anniversari Edition.""Th WSJi also back the theori that the new iPhon will be equip with a curv OLE display, similar to that use bySamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) on it Galaxi S7 Edg smartphone.7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Flush With CashOn big chang suggest by theWSJi a bombshell: Appl may ditch the Lightn port on the iPhon 8, opt to replac it with USB-C.Whi Would AAPL Court Controversi with the iPhon 8?Appl ha a long histori of make controversi chang to it products, especi when it come to elimin or replac ports.In the past year alone, it ha face backlash over elimin the long-tim standard 3.5mm headphon jack on the iPhon 7. And it' still tri to appeas buyer of the new MacBook Pro, after elimin all legaci port andreplac them with the new USB-C. Then there wa the last big iPhon port chang in 2012, when Appl ditch the 30-pin dock connector it had use with everi iO devic sinc the 2003 gener iPods, render million of dock useless.It replacement? The Lightn port.Ditch the Lightn port on the iPhon 8 would be a long-term win for AAPL fans. USB-C is an industri standard and move to it from a proprietari connect would mean not have to pay a premium for cables. It would also make Apple' overal product strategi a lot cleaner. Right now, everi new iPhon come with a USB to Lightn cabl for charg - but Apple' own MacBook and new MacBook Pro have onli USB-C ports. So new iPhon buyer can't connect their new iPhon to their new laptop without first invest in anoth proprietari Appl cable.Unfortunately, there are go to be iPhon 7 owner who bought new headphon equip with a Lightn cabl instead of the tradit 3.5mm headphon jack. Those peopl will not be thrill that their new headphon - purchas becaus Appl ditch a standard port - will now be incompat with the iPhon 8, again becaus AAPL ditch a standard port. They'll have to look for an adapter.Ther will be a confus period of overlap. All iO devic sinc 2012 have use Lightn and AAPL also use that port for charg accessori like it latest wireless keyboard and the Appl TV' Siri remote. It' also like that AAPL won't mess with iPhon 7 design, so the iPhon 7s - which will also releas in 2017 - is like to still have the Lightn connector. More potenti for confus …However, it won't be as bad for APPL as the switch to Lightn in the first place. Most manufactur learn their lesson then and speaker now are primarili wireless instead of use a physic dock, so they won't be stranded. The iPhon 8 is also expect tosupport wireless chargingand combin with wireless updat and Bluetooth headphones, mani user won't need a physic connect at all anyway.How Like Is Appl to Go With USB-C on the iPhon 8?Most of thi inform inTh Wall Street Journal'sreport isn't new. We were write about thatcurv displayback in August, for example. However, at thi point in the new iPhone' develop cycle, the final design is begin to be nail down. Rumor are becom more concret as Apple' suppli chain start ramp up, however, AAPL may yet back down and stick with the Lightn port on the iPhon 8 rather than risk controversy.Leav Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Stock to the SavagesIf it goe ahead with the change, new iPhon buyer may shrug, some may skip the iPhon 8, or they may hold off on buy to see what the fallout is.Th onli outcom we know for certain? Dongl manufactur have been make out like bandit with the new, all-USB-C MacBook Pro. They should also have a banner year in 2017 with the iPhon 8.

The Best Way to Beat the S&P 500,2/27/2017,"Investor use the Standard & Poor' index' perform to judg their own, and the Holi Grail is to outperform the index consistently.But what if I told you there wa a way to outperform the index consist by buy the index itself and do almost no work for the addit gains?Sound appeal and almost too good to be true.makeArticleAd();Well, it is true, and thi techniqu is avail to everi investor.Th reason thi is possibl is the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index is comput by a weight averag market capit calcul by take the number of share outstand of each compani and multipli the number by the company' current share price. Thi is a rel lazi way of calcul an index and give more weight to larger constitu and less weight to smaller compani so the index is disproportion affect by a declin inApple(AAPL) compar to a smaller firm.OutdatedThi approach ha work well sinc the S&P 500' inception, but it isn't the best approach. Becaus small compani usual grow faster than their larger counterparts, it doesn't make much sens to give these compani a lower weight in the index as it stunt their impact on the broader market. Surely, if small cap are given more weight, the index would perform better overall?That' exactli what the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index shows. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index doe what it say on the tin. The index give each constitu an equal weight without take into account market capit or other factors. The result of use thi strategi have been extrem impressive. From 2003 through 2015, a $10,000 invest in the tradit S&P 500 index would have turn into $29,370. Dure that same period, the same invest in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index would have turn into $38,866. Over the past five years, the S&P 500Equal Weight Index ha return 26.8% compar to the tradit S&P 500' return of 23.3%.What' behind the outperformance?Ther is a belief that the reason whi equal weight index outperform tradit market capit weight peer is due to the weight of small cap in the index. However, accord to research conduct by Robert Ferguson and David Schofield, senior invest offic and presid of Intech International, there is anoth reason whi equal weight index tend to outperform over the long term.They believ the outperform of equal weight index ha more to do with the index' constitu rebalanc than anyth else. For example, to maintain requir equal weights, the index provid ha to sell a stock after a recent run higher but also buy more of a compani if it ha drastic underperform over a set period. Put simpli thi trade requir creat a ""buy low sell high"" trade strategy, which is both contrarian and momentum chasing.Ferguson and Schofield go on to note that surprisingli the underli alpha sourc is alway posit for such indicators, which is anoth indic that excess return ha someth to do with volatility. Equal-weight index have a higher track error over time rel to the capit weight index. The reason whi thi is the case lie in diversity.Divers is at it maximum if all stock capit are equal. Chang in divers influenc rel return of the equal-weight portfolio. As the capit distribut curv ha a typic shape, divers must have a typic valu with no long term trend. In thi case, the influenc due to chang in divers will be close to zero over time, and the outperform of the equal-weight portfolio will be close to it volatility-bas source, which is necessarili posit (stock return can be both posit and negative, but volatil is alway positive).When the effect of divers are combin with contrarian/momentum investing, the equal weight index can captur higher alpha and less sever underperform periods.Disclosure:Th author own no stock mentioned.Start afre seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.GILD 15-Year Financi DataTh intrins valu of GILDPet Lynch Chart of GILDPremium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investor celebr Cisco' revenu tailspin?Busi Model Transit for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throe of a seriou busi model transition. Sinc it earli days, the compani ha been in the busi of sell switch and router that move data around the internet. That' still true in a big way sinc the compani still deriv more than 40% of it revenu from thi network business.But with more and more compani reli on rent comput servic from the like ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buy less and less of Cisco' hardwar for their data centers.Even wors is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrad to newer devic less often. Further, Cisco is increasingli face tougher competit and cheaper offer from the like ofArista Network Inc(NYSE:ANET), a compani that wa found by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more compani are experi with software-defin network (SDN), and Cisco is find itself caught between a rock and hard place.

Dure the last quarter, the company' Product gross margin decreas from 63.4% to 61.1%, but it Servic gross margin increas from 65.1% to 67.7%.

Cisco spend a lot of thi cash on M&A activity. Dure the latest earn call, Cisco announc that it wa take AppDynam off the IPO tabl by dole out $3.7 billion for the applic perform manag startup. But incom investor need not worri - in the same vein, Cisco announc that it wa hike it quarterli dividend by 3 cent to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yield a gener 3.5%, among the highest yield in theDow Jone Industri Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco institut the dividend six year ago when it declar a quarterli payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield.

To make it softwar seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycl between major version of Microsoft Office, and to address the grow threat of Google' free Googl App suite, five year ago, the compani began push Offic 365.Thi subscript version of Microsoft Offic brought recur monthli revenu and other advantages.

The Best Way to Beat the S&P 500,2/27/2017,"Investor use the Standard & Poor' index' perform to judg their own, and the Holi Grail is to outperform the index consistently.But what if I told you there wa a way to outperform the index consist by buy the index itself and do almost no work for the addit gains?Sound appeal and almost too good to be true.makeArticleAd();Well, it is true, and thi techniqu is avail to everi investor.Th reason thi is possibl is the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index is comput by a weight averag market capit calcul by take the number of share outstand of each compani and multipli the number by the company' current share price. Thi is a rel lazi way of calcul an index and give more weight to larger constitu and less weight to smaller compani so the index is disproportion affect by a declin inApple(AAPL) compar to a smaller firm.OutdatedThi approach ha work well sinc the S&P 500' inception, but it isn't the best approach. Becaus small compani usual grow faster than their larger counterparts, it doesn't make much sens to give these compani a lower weight in the index as it stunt their impact on the broader market. Surely, if small cap are given more weight, the index would perform better overall?That' exactli what the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index shows. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index doe what it say on the tin. The index give each constitu an equal weight without take into account market capit or other factors. The result of use thi strategi have been extrem impressive. From 2003 through 2015, a $10,000 invest in the tradit S&P 500 index would have turn into $29,370. Dure that same period, the same invest in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index would have turn into $38,866. Over the past five years, the S&P 500Equal Weight Index ha return 26.8% compar to the tradit S&P 500' return of 23.3%.What' behind the outperformance?Ther is a belief that the reason whi equal weight index outperform tradit market capit weight peer is due to the weight of small cap in the index. However, accord to research conduct by Robert Ferguson and David Schofield, senior invest offic and presid of Intech International, there is anoth reason whi equal weight index tend to outperform over the long term.They believ the outperform of equal weight index ha more to do with the index' constitu rebalanc than anyth else. For example, to maintain requir equal weights, the index provid ha to sell a stock after a recent run higher but also buy more of a compani if it ha drastic underperform over a set period. Put simpli thi trade requir creat a ""buy low sell high"" trade strategy, which is both contrarian and momentum chasing.Ferguson and Schofield go on to note that surprisingli the underli alpha sourc is alway posit for such indicators, which is anoth indic that excess return ha someth to do with volatility. Equal-weight index have a higher track error over time rel to the capit weight index. The reason whi thi is the case lie in diversity.Divers is at it maximum if all stock capit are equal. Chang in divers influenc rel return of the equal-weight portfolio. As the capit distribut curv ha a typic shape, divers must have a typic valu with no long term trend. In thi case, the influenc due to chang in divers will be close to zero over time, and the outperform of the equal-weight portfolio will be close to it volatility-bas source, which is necessarili posit (stock return can be both posit and negative, but volatil is alway positive).When the effect of divers are combin with contrarian/momentum investing, the equal weight index can captur higher alpha and less sever underperform periods.Disclosure:Th author own no stock mentioned.Start afre seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.GILD 15-Year Financi DataTh intrins valu of GILDPet Lynch Chart of GILDPremium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap,2/26/2017,"Mani dividend investor search for compani that have fat yield and trade for an attract valuation. Of course, compani with high dividend yield can be risky, so potenti owner need to be quit picki about which stock they choos to buy.Let' take a closer look at two stock --Spark Energy(NASDAQ: SPKE) andGameStop(NYSE: GME) -- that both have above-averag yield and low valuations. Is either stock worth buying?Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();A differ energi choiceMani consum who live in deregul energi market might be surpris to learn they have a choic of electr and ga providers. Spark Energi is one of the mani independ retail energy-servic compani in the countri that offer a compet choice.Spark Energi isn't an energi producer. It buy energi and ga on the wholesal market and resel it to consum at retail prices. The compani claim that switch to it servic in mani case can help it custom save money.Whil persuad custom to make the switch can be tough, Spark ha been in rapid growth mode over the past few years, thank to it healthi appetit for acquisitions. Sinc it 2014 IPO, it ha complet seven acquisitions, which ha help consist drive it top line higher. When combin with the company' gener dividend polici -- Spark' current yield is 5.7% -- sharehold have seen signific valu creation.SPK Total Return Pricedata byYChartsGiven that the retail energy-servic market is highli fragmented, Spark appear to help plenti of room left to expand. With share trade for about 9 time forward earnings, the number suggest that thi could be a home-run invest in the making.However, while all of Spark' number look great, there are a few warn signs. For one, compani that grow by acquisit are notori difficult to understand, sinc their financi statement are alway changing. That make them difficult to value, and it can be easi for manag to hide intern problems. In addition, Spark ha receiv a lot of terribl review on site such asYelpand the Better Busi Bureau, from custom who claim the compani use high-pressur sale techniqu to get them to switch and who then saw their energi bill rise. Finally, with more than 42% of the company' publicli avail share have been shorted, a lot of money manag are bet big against thi company.A retail in transitionJust as in the DVD and music business, video-gam consum are gradual shift away from buy physic product and look toward digit channel to get their fix. That trend ha been a thorn in the side of video-gam retail GameStop over the past few years. The increas popular of digit game ha creat less of a need to visit one of the company' stores, put downward pressur on it sales. Manag ha admit that the trend is here to stay and ha project a slow but steadi declin in it legaci business.However, there are reason to believ that the declin won't be as steep as you'd first expect. Cutting-edg video game for the PlayStat 4 or Xbox One can sometim requir up to 40 gigabyt of storag space to play, which is mani multipl higher than video or music files. That' one reason digit penetr of high-qual video game still remain rel low. In addition, digit game can't be resold the way physic game can. That provid an incent for gamer to continu to visit GameStop' stores.Meanwhile, GameStop is look for other way to drive sale growth. The compani ha creat it own digit game platform that current ring up more than $1 billion in digit sales. Manag is also make a move into the collect space through it acquisit of ThinkGeek, and sale are grow quickly. In fact, manag believ that thi busi could hit $1 billion in revenu by 2019.Finally, GameStop is push hard into the mobil and comput market with it Spring Mobil and Simpli Mac concepts. These store are lead author resel of product fromAT&TandApple. Believ it or not, these new sale channel are expect to drive modest earningsgrowthov the next five years.Still, mani investor are worri that thi strategi shift won't work in the long run and have price GameStop' share accordingly. The compani is trade for less the ridicul cheap price of 7 time forward earnings, and it dividend yield ha been push abov 5.6%. More than 27% of the company' publicli avail stock ha been sold sort, which tell you how littl faith the market have in thi company.I either worth buying?Whil Spark offer investor a high yield, the potenti for growth, and a cheap valuation, I see too mani warn sign to be will to put money into the stock. GameStop, on the other hand, is also a high-risk bet, but the compani is still highli profit and appear to have a realist plan in place for slowli turn it fortun around. That make me think GameStop might be the better bet for dare investors.10 stock we like better than GameStopWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Will Apple Inc. Completely Ditch Qualcomm, Inc. in the iPhone?",2/26/2017,"Analyst Christoph Rolland with Susquehanna (bi way ofBarron's) recent put out a note suggest thatIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be abl to wrestl away more cellular modem market share fromQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) in futureApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon models.Bi way of background, Appl current sourc cellular modem from both Intel and Qualcomm in it iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu smartphones. Rolland estim that Qualcomm ha between a 50% and 70% share of iPhon modem shipments, leav Intel with between 30% and 50%.A wafer of Intel processors. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Th analyst point out that Intel' recent announc XMM 7560 modem support the CDMA wireless standard, a featur that Intel' previou modem have lacked. Sinc some wireless carrier requir CDMA support, Appl couldn't complet abandon Qualcomm in the iPhone.""W believ CDMA support wa a gate issu in win the major of iPhon 7 sockets, as select global carrier requir the standard,"" Rolland writes.Th analyst then say if Appl were to ditch Qualcomm complet in favor of Intel modems, it would lead to a $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion reduct in Qualcomm' revenu and a drop of between $0.25 and $0.35 per share in earnings.Intel, the analyst says, could stand to see revenu grow by between $800 million and $1.1 billion from such a switch, with earn per share grow between $0.06 and $0.08.There' littl doubt that have a CDMA-cap modem onli help Intel and hurt Qualcomm as it relat to the iPhone, but I don't think it' realist to expect Appl to fulli ditch Qualcomm. Here' why.Two supplier are better than oneTher are good reason to have multipl supplier for critic components. Have multipl supplier help to guard against potenti execut problem on the part of a singl supplier, such as suppli issu and product-qu issues.To be blunt, Qualcomm' track record with respect to cellular modem advanc is impeccable; Intel' execution, meanwhile, seem to have improv solidli over the years, but it' still not a good idea to bet the iPhon on Intel.Beyond risk mitigation, though, have multipl compet supplier in the mix improv the buyer' abil to negoti price to it benefit.Remember, until Intel announc the XMM 7560, Appl essenti had one compani from which it could buy CDMA-cap LTE modem -- Qualcomm. So if Appl want to sell phone compat with network that requir CDMA support, it need to buy chip from Qualcomm -- period.Moreover, in a recent lawsuit that Appl file against Qualcomm, the former claim the latter charg Appl a ""monopolist premium"" for cellular modem with CDMA support, even though those chip were ""in all other respect ident to the chipset sold to Appl without CDMA function enabled.""If Appl had previous had multipl supplier option for CDMA-cap LTE modems, Qualcomm might not have been abl to get away with charg such a premium.So by have both Qualcomm and Intel in the mix suppli modem that are, for all intent and purposes, interchangeable, Appl should be abl to lower it compon cost and ultim either boost it gross profit margin or redirect the save to ad more featur to futur iPhon models.Qualcomm may see lower allocationThough I don't think it' like for Qualcomm to lose all the iPhon business, I could see Qualcomm' share at Appl come down. Further, I could see Qualcomm' averag sell price of the chip that it doe sell to Appl come down from where they would have otherwis been if Intel weren't on the verg of releas a CDMA-cap modem.Th situat doesn't look great for Qualcomm, and it look pretti good for Intel, but in the scheme of both companies' respect consolid revenues, thi just isn't a potenti game changer for either one.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Horrendously Bad Stock Market Predictions From Otherwise Smart People,2/26/2017,"""It' tough to make predictions, especi about the future.""-- Yogi BerramakeArticleAd();Everi year, the stock market either advances, declines, or stay flat. It' never clear beforehand which direct these indexes, or the stock that compris them, will move; the reason for their price swing onli make sens in retrospect.But that truth doesn't stop peopl from make aggress predict attempt to identifi the Next Big Thing or to call a come crash or boom. Here are a few classic exampl of some smart market watcher get burn by their stock calls.1. McDonald' will trounc Googl as an investmentWhitney Tilsonha use hi valu invest approach to produc awesom return for himself and hi investor over the years. Yet hi tendenc to bash ""expensive"" compani with high price-to-earn ratio ha also burn the hedg fund giant -- big time.For example, back in 2004, Tilson made abold prediction. Write for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the soon-to-be-publicAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost certainli flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odd are at least 90% that it profit margin and growth rate will be materi lower five year from now,"" he argued.Tilson got even more specific, say thatMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given it far lower valuation. ""I believ that it is virtual certain that Google' stock will be highli disappoint to investor foolish enough to particip in it overhyp offer -- you can hold me to that,"" he concluded.GOOGL Market Capdata byYCharts.So how did that predict pan out? Sinc 2005, Alphabet share are up roughli 16 times, compar to less than a 400% return for the fast food titan. The search engin giant produc nearli $20 billion of net incom last year, versu McDonald' $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six time McDonald' in the eye of the market.2. Smartphon will be a bustA deep understand of technolog isn't enough to protect you from be surpris by major shift in the industry. Andrew Grove wa one of the founder ofIntel, which profoundli shape the semiconductor industry. He wasTim Magazine' Man of The Year in 1997. Yet in 1992 he made a predict that look amazingli shortsight in retrospect.Imag source: Getti Images.ANew York Timesarticledescrib Grove as stand diametr oppos to the posit taken byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) that smartphones, then imagin as ""person communicators,"" might develop into a huge business. They'd be ""the mother of all markets,"" accord to Apple' then-CEO, John Sculley.Grov disagreed. The idea of a commun devic that peopl carri around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by greed,"" he said. Ironically, the articl list a few predict about the technolog that prove prescient. These person commun might handl emails, use GP to map directions, and even allow someon to ""order pizza use a combin of custom electron form and wireless fax.""Today, the smartphon industri is massive, with Appl account for nearli 150 million iPhon sale in the past year. These devic help spur over $24 billion of complementari service-bas revenue, which demonstr that, if anything, investor weren't be greedi enough about the potenti for smartphon to find a huge market.3.

The economi in fact reflect ""the best performancein almost two yearsin the final quarter of 2016.""The economi is export-ori and mainli focus on technology-rel products. Now with an improv global economi and higher demand for gadget and smartphon from variou brand in emerg markets, tech-compon compani are like to soar higher.ETF ChoicesGiven the recent ralli in the Taiwanes market, investor might consid ETF play from the space. While Taiwan ha a substanti share in variou emerg market and Asia-Pacif equiti ETFs, FTW and EWT can come across as better bets, thank to their sole focu on Taiwan.EWT in FocusmakeArticleAd();Thi ETF invest about $2.73 billion of it asset in 91 securities. However, with over one-fifth of the total exposur be on a singl company, Taiwan Semiconductor, EWT ha signific concentr risk.Hon Hai take up the second posit in the portfolio with about 9% share. However, the rest of the stock have about a 3% share. Sector-wise, EWT reli heavili on inform technolog (56%), financi (18.3%) and materi (10.5%). The fund charg an expens ratio of 64 basi point (read:Tim to Buy Taiwan ETFs?).First Trust Taiwan AlphaDEX FundFTWThi fund target the Taiwan stock market and track the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Taiwan Index. The fund ha a basket of 41 stock with each secur hold less than 4.57% of the assets.Inform technolog take the top spot at 48.16% in term of sectors, follow by financi (27.5%) and materi (12.5%).

The compani alway deni ani widespread issue.Until now.AAPL ha final acknowledg a problem relat to the iPhon 6 batteri … and say it ha releas a fix.Th iPhon 6 Batteri Ha Been … ProblematicIf there' one thing 2016 will be rememb for when it come to consum electronics, it' the challeng of work with lithium-ion batteries.5 Incom Tax Deduct You Can't Afford to MissTh poster child for just how wrong thi technolog can go isSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung had a terribl 2016 after it flagship Galaxi Note 7' lithium-ion batteri were implic in multipl fires, Thi led to a complet recal of the device, an estim $10 billion hit, a serious damag reput and anextens investig to pinpoint the cause.In comparison, AAPL' iPhon 6 batteri woe have been less spectacular, but the cloud over Apple' previou two gener of phone ha last just as long - if not longer. And they prove much more frustrat in term of nail down a cause, or a fix. That' becaus there appear to be multipl issu at play. And just as Appl admit there' a problem and announc a solution, anoth iPhon 6 batteri issu seem to pop up.In 2016, Appl had to deal with aninvestig in Chinaov report that iPhon 6 and iPhon 6s batteri were not onli failing, but leav the devic with expens damage. Apple' find point to cheap knock-off charger as the culprit. Then there were report of iPhon 6s phone unexpectedli shut down.

Just whenQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) start to unveil a game-chang technology, a legal hurrican start to make landfall. If ani current or would-b owner of QCOM stock are torn as to what the futur like holds, there' good reason.makeArticleAd();Source:Karli Dambran via FlickrAnd yet, as much jeopardi as the company' bottom line may be in at thi time, the fact that Qualcomm stock is still down more than 25% over the past three year suggest the market saw a litig headwind come sooner or later. The worst-cas scenario may alreadi be price into QCOM stock, which mean the recent weak make for a compel entri point.Th BadTh legal wrangl is mostli withAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Appl be success with it effort, it open the door to other litigation, not to mention embolden a similar case be brought against Qualcomm by the Feder Trade Commission.Th short version of the story: Appl (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all argu the same thing - Qualcomm' busi model of licens it technolog to phonemak isnot onli exorbitant, but unlaw stifl competition. That' a legal no-no in most ani country. The Korea Fair Trade Commiss isseek $873 million for essenti the same.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM ha lost thi argument before. In 2015, thecompani fork over $975 million to Chinafor break that country' antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedli charg all-encompass licens feesto phonemak that may or may not have need access to all of the technolog in that IP package… anoth dubiou practice.Year of sharp deal have final caught up with Qualcomm.Th GoodTh ironi is, while the compani wa over-milk it age patent portfolio, QCOM wa also develop some new - and highli market - intellectu property.Th idea of the Internet of Thing (IoT) is an excit one, but the realiti is, the technolog and bandwidth need to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. Thi week, Qualcommunveil it 802.11ax technology, which can carri four time the amount of data current Wi-Fi technolog carries, but without use ani more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technolog VP Rahul Patel explained:It is take Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experi point of view. What it is tri to do is prepar the Wi-Fi network, which in mani case is experienc a lot of congestion, larg becaus the network is becom dens and is not abl to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the compani ha creat a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connect between a mobil phone' modem and the transceiver. Not onli is it a superior solut to current alternatives, it' a simpler solut that work with a varieti of connect protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the util of modem intelligence.They'r not the kind of advanc the averag consum care about, or even understands. With 5G connect about to becom the norm, however, these littl advanc are actual big advanc that phonemak will desper need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the futur of QCOM stock lie somewher between the two end of thi good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm' busi model of leverag an age patent portfolio - and do so in a question manner - is go to falter. If the compani want to continu be an IP player, it' go to need some new IP.Th question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platform be enough? It matters, simpli becauseth company' licens and royalti revenu is roughli twice it revenu from outright chip sales.3 Stock That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeTh answer to thi question is a qualifi yes; the qualif is the speed with which lawsuit will result in a decision, and the time that will be need for IoT and 5G to reach critic mass. Odd are good the former will hurt befor the latter helps, mean Qualcomm could be head for a dri spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-term who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreci the potenti of the distant futur now…aft a few year of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropri for grandma' retir portfolio, but there' littl doubt the company' new technolog will be crucial to the next gener of connectivity.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

Those are the compani I like to frequent, and I have alway wonder if these type of firms-which have a long histori of satisfi their customers-end up make better invest too.Well, in thi edit ofth Dutram Report, I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, for some insight into thi topic and if thi idea work as an investment.Insid ACSIKevin is an expert in the American Custom Satisfact Index, a benchmark that exist to find compani that custom either like, or would rather avoid. Thi is done by look at a few key area of the custom satisfact process, includ custom expectations, perceiv value, and perceiv quality.Thi data ha proven to be extrem popular with companies, as it help them to keep tab on the competit and to see their rel stand among their peer too. But the data can also be use to shape the outlook for compani and to see how they are trend in term of custom satisfaction, which can help to show which compani are move in the right direction.ACSI' idea is that custom satisfact lead to custom loyalty, which lead to addit consum spend which ultim lead to long-term stock appreciation. Thi intuit make sense, and now there is a way to use thi strategi in ETF form.Th ETFThi is via ACSI Funds' American Custom Satisfact Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). Thi product hold secur that have high ACSI custom satisfact scores, with the theori be that these will outperform their low-satisfact peers.Curr hold includ well-respect name like Appl (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozen of name in the portfolio. And if you are wonder what is done for sector where custom satisfact level aren't as readili available, such as energi or materials, big ETFs-such asXLEorXLB-ar util in order to give more broad market-lik exposure.Bottom LineFor a more in-depth look at thi index as well as it invest counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for addit information.

Trump's Tax Policy May Make for Some Very Easy Investing,2/23/2017,"Presid Donald Trump hasn't offici releas hi propos chang to tax polici yet, but we pretti much know what to expect.It is go to make life veri easi for us as investors. We can just buy the most profit U.S. compani with the biggest hoard of balanc sheet cash and then relax.makeArticleAd();W know that we can count on a reduct in the tax rate corpor pay. As recent as Decemb Trump indic that he plan to have the rate of corpor tax reduc from 35% to 15%.Part two of the reduct in corpor tax is the ""repatri holiday"" that Trump want that would allow compani to bring oversea cash back home without have to pay a signific amount of tax on it.Both of these chang are go to benefit the biggest, strongest compani in the country.In hi fourth-quart letter, hedg fund manag David Einhorn observ that the way to invest for Trump polici is to focu on compani that are current pay a lot of incom taxes. It make perfect sense.Th most profit compani are go to get a huge bump up in cash flow when that corpor tax rate drop to 15%. What would be ideal then is to find compani that are both veri profit (pay a lot of incom tax) and have a lot of oversea cash that the repatri holiday can free up.A compani that fit that mold veri well would beApple(AAPL). Appl is a longtim posit in Einhorn' fund and a veri profit compani with a lot of oversea cash.Her is what Einhorn said specif about Appl in hi recent investor letter:Appl stand to benefit from repatri of foreign cash and tax reform. The compani ha over $200 billion in offshor cash it could bring back to the U.S. Appl also deriv a major of it earn from foreign sourc but still accru GAAP tax at a 25% rate, which is higher than mani other larg tech companies. The lower corpor tax rate propos as part of repatri and tax reform could therefor lead Appl toward a structur lower GAAP tax rate go forward.If Apple' tax paid on repatri that cash just drop by 25% that mean the compani should be worth $50 billion more than it wa without the repatri holiday. That is a $10 per share bump without the compani have to do anything.If Apple' annual tax rate also drop by 60% under a Trump corpor tax cut that would reduc GAAP incom tax expens from $15 billion last year to $4.8 billion. That is a $10 billion bump to earn which on just a 10 multipl mean a $100 billion increas to Apple' market capitalization. That is closer to $20 per share.Add the two of them togeth and you could see a $30 per share bump inApple' share pricejust from Trump' tax policies. That is on a stock that is arguabl attract price already.Thank you for the idea, Mr. Einhorn. Thank you for make invest easy, Mr. Trump.Disclosure:I don't own share of ani compani mention in thi articleStart afre seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Warning!

AAPL ha $247 billion of cash on hand, although most of it is stuck overseas.However, we are in a new era, and it is an era where Presid Trump and Congress may lower the corpor tax rate to 15%. If that happens, the $230 billion of cash it hold oversea will be repatriated. That will leav Appl with $212 billion of cash.Thi insan amount of money will be partial use to bump the dividend, probabl by as much as $4 per share over time, push AAPL stock into incom stock territory.Blue-Chip Stocks: Gener Electr (GE)Source: ShutterstockCash Balance:$92 billionWhat It Should Do:M&A, Share buybacksGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) is not the compani it onc was, and I recent wrote that I don't think you want to be buy GE stock at $30 per share. However, it ha about $92 billion in cash on hand, and most of it is overseas, as well.Repatri that money would leav it with a sizabl $77 billion cash hoard.

This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure Thing,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsImmedi after the U.S. elections, the consensu wa to buy the small cap and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stock likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell, but eventu recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-tim high. Then came earn season.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh reaction to GOOGL earn wa brutal - share fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bull step in and defend the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc ha all but eras the entir post-earn dip.I'v alway said that the short-term reaction to earn is pure a gamble. And that the longer-term fundament will eventu prevail.Mi interpret of Alphabet earn is that the Googl machin is still on rails! It print money from multipl asset that have more than a billion users; manag is a proven winner; and spend on crazi ventur ha abated. Alphabet now even have offici structur to profit from the self-driv auto arena.3 Cover Call to Squeez Dividend Out of Thin AirSo, for the long term, I have no real worri for GOOGL stock other than the gener equiti market gyrations. If market sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect share to fall too far on their own from the company' own actions.GOOGL Option PlayOpt are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trade with ampl buffer that I expect to be sure winner given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defend by fundament investors. Then I sell risk against those level and sit back and let time work for me.You'v read the statist that most option expir worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of option sinc the buyer lose most often.Th Bet:Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. Thi is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price give thi trade a 95% theoret chanc of success. Sell nake put is dangerous. Not everyon is comfort expos themselv to such downsid risk. If GOOGL stock fall below my sold put, I am commit to own the stock at that level. So anyth below $647 per share would accru loss if GOOGL fall 30% or so.Sinc risk toler vary, I will offer an altern trade with similar metric but with a finit risk profile. The altern version would better fit smaller accounts, too.Th Alternate:Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoret chanc of success is still more than 90%. If successful, thi trade yield 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay abov my sold spread to win.Usually, I like to balanc my trade by sell opposit risk. In thi case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entri a littl in thi ""anim spirited"" equiti market.Th Hedg (Optional):Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. Thi is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread avail yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. Thi trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potenti yield would almost doubl becaus I can onli lose on one side or the other. In thi case, the two side will balance, but not perfectly. I am not requir to hold these option trade through expiration. I can close ani of them for partial gain or losses.Nicola Chahin is the manag director ofSellSpreads.com. As of thi writing, he did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsChoos between buyingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choic between valu and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the valu play, while GOOGL stock provid the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil Appl share have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earn ratio around 16, lower than what investor are pay for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cent per share, more than cover by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenu increas to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. Thi justifi a P/E of nearli 30. The share are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investor prefer valu over growth and Appl stock is do better than Alphabet. But thi isn't the proverbi choic between a rock and a hard place, instead, it' more like pick between cooki and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have own them for sever years, and I have profit handsom hold both.Th Case for AAPL StockNo technolog compani is as adept at squeez profit from hardwar as Apple.Whil other smartphon compani struggl to make money, Appl regularli bring $1 of everi $4 in iPhon sale to it bottom line. It close ecosystem is perceiv as safe and their product last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowTh current case for Appl stock, however, ha littl to do with hardware. Instead,servic now driveth stock forward. Servic like it app store - from which it take a 30% cut of sale - Appl Music, iPay and iCloud have becom huge, with $7.17 billion of revenu in the fourth quarter alone. The success of it servic enabl Appl to becom a power in the cloud by put more than$12 billioninto capit spend last year. It' no secret that the cloud is a capital-intens business, but Appl ha been abl to out-spend cloud rival without disturb it profit machine.AAPL hadov $246 billion in cashon it book at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administr ha propos a one-tim tax cut to encourag Appl to bring thi cash back to the U.S. That' enough money to buy compani such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analyst subtract the Appl cash from it market cap, they find the compani itself valu at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two time sales. If you'r look for a cheap valu stock, pois for an era of unpreced growth, with plenti of safeti and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.Th Case for GOOGL StockTh artist formerli known as Googl have a differ case to make.Alphabet ha becom acash flow monster, deliv nearli $40 billion in oper cash flow last year. It revenu grew nearli 20%, and GOOGL' oper margin is over 25%.Cloud scale like no invent ever seen before, and Alphabet deliv a global search servic for liter nothing. It Android oper system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watch as custom who own them come to it services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL ha also becom a power in hardware. It Chromebook now outsel Apple' Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now particip in all the hardwar market pioneer by rival - from virtual realiti headset to stream devic - with watch and person assist that let you conduct search of your home or the world with just your voice.Und CFO Ruth Porat, who join the compani fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is final tell investor how much they'r spend on ""other bets"" like robot and self-driv cars, and it' work to make money on those ventures.Th Bottom LineIt' hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Noth More Than Feelings.Th perceiv threat to Alphabet is the grow balkan of the Internet, with nation govern seek to control what peopl see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That ha yet to impact GOOGL, but even the percept can hurt a stock.AAPL is current benefit from a global flight to safety. It enorm cash position, it strength as a luxuri brand, and it growth in services, which could easili be expand into competit in the cloud with compani such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If push to the wall and forc to buy just one right now, I would probabl go with GOOG, the non-vot version of Alphabet stock, which share equal in earn but sell at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both compani are likeGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) wa in the 1950s,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) wa in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) wa in the last decade.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI'm a firm believ inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the markets, there is an elit group of compani that defin their respect industries. For example,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) own e-commerce, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha forev chang social media. And for now,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the king of smart devices. But in my humbl opinion, GOOGL stock top them all.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDon't get me wrong as thi is not a slight against ani of the abov companies. Just let me forward a veri basic observ - all these other name essenti requir the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet repres their core market message.But what happen when you own the internet? That' a theoret question to everyon except GOOGL.A I mention in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engin is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whop 300%. It just get wors as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it' just not even worth considering. In ani other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an invest in life itself. Mani peopl thought that thenam changeto Alphabet - a play on the financi term ""alpha"" and the gambl term ""bet"" - wa cheeki and a bit ridiculous. But it also signifi that Alphabet Inc could do whatev it want becaus no one can stop it. GOOGL stock wa essenti either an asset or a threat, depend on your perspective.Volatil Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matter most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't alway shown it best stuff. True, it' earli into 2017, and so far, it' up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up everi month and you'r guarante a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc ha also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlac contributor Chri Tyler point out. For example, GOOGL wa look at close Januari at over 6%. Instead, it onli secur 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowOn a strictli nomin basis, that' not much of a swing. But on percentag basis, it' a much differ story. It ha been well over a decad sinc Alphabet stock introduc itself to the markets. The crazi dynam involv in a fresh tech compani should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and it subsidiari are compar toGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) if GE wa a littl more hip.But with great size come great envy. Alphabet Inc now face a fundament problem.Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) want to reengag acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issu is the company' gener use of Oracle' Java softwar in order to design the Android oper system. GOOGL contend that use Java - which is open-sourc - is fair game. Oracl contend that it violat the ""fair use "" compon of copyright law.For those that acquir GOOGL stock, it' an ugli situat that might be a legitim risk. Here' the thing - whether it' legitim or not doesn't matter. If the market think it' a problem, it' a problem. That make the sight of what appear to be a bearish head-and-should pattern (between earli Decemb until now) a curiou development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it' not the best idea to buy an invest with baggage. Certainly, it' not a good idea when the baggag is from a giant compani like Oracle. Ditto that for it 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someon you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock ha some challenges.3 Struggl Stock That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it' a coincid that the head-and-should pattern is emerg right now. If I'm look at Alphabet Inc pure as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at thi juncture. I expect share to at least test it 50-day move average, which stand just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide toward it 200-day move average, which is around $763.Again, that' look at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technic as it is fundamentally. Asid from some bump in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoy clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bump have never affect Alphabet Inc in a perman way.Th bottom line here is that I would be content hold GOOGL stock. Further, ani dip are justifi buy opportunities, not mere contrarian for it own sake. Alphabet Inc isgo to $1,000- just tri to ignor the turbul as best you can.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Consum Stock That Will Knock Your Sock Off7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeTh postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappear first onInvestorPlace."

Although the fact that FIT went into the red wasn't a surprise, the magnitud certainli was. On a per share basis, Fitbit stock wa expect by Wall Street analyst to mitig neg to 48 cents.

In actuality, FIT stock manag $573.8 million, or a neg surpris of a littl more than 0.3%. The margin of the miss isn't so bad in and of itself. However, with so mani critic take aim at Fitbit stock, the compani need someth spectacular on thi front. Whatev thi is, it just isn't go to do the trick.Although it' not fair, the Fitbit earn miss is exagger due to the fact that it' the first one. Accord toCNBC' archives, prior to yesterday' earn report, the devic maker leverag an averageearn surpriseof 103%.One of the most promin critic came from Jim Cramer. Appear on CNBC' ""Squawk on the Street"" segment late last month, Cramer suggest that FIT wa acommodit company. Onc peopl buy the product, there is no compel reason to buy again. And when you consid the sharp eros in sale growth, it' hard not to see thi point.To illustrate, quarter-over-quarterrevenu growthin 2015 wa 170%. In 2016, it ha drop to an alarm 25%!Sinc they'r not kill it on profit margins, FIT ha drastic action to take. At least to that end, manag is make the right moves.Eas the Mind of Fitbit Stock BuyersLast month, FIT announc aseri of layoffs, which will affect about 10% of the total workforce. The tech firm is hope to save $200 million, which is a huge deal for it size.W also have to reconsid thi critic of Fitbit stock as a ""commoditized"" investment. It' both a valid and an invalid argument. You can liter say the same thing aboutAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE). That hasn't stop them from make smart phones, tablet and cameras. The latter is a particularli good exampl of a wide distribut product continu to find solid demand.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Make a Giant Push in It Supercharg NetworkIt shouldn't come as no surpris that we live in a dispos world.

As long as FIT stock remain an innov invest first, I don't care about ancillari titl like commoditized.And the compani ha a strong user base.

The technology, green cred and especi the potenti long-term fuel save go a long way toward overcom ani initi sticker shock.Th big problem is rang anxiety.7 Marvel Mid-Cap Stock to Buy for the Best of All WorldsRegular driver don't worri about run out of ga becaus there is a vast network of ga station across the country. With an estimated150,000 ga station in the U.S.(in 2015), you are seldom more than a few minut away from be abl to refuel. Onc there, it' typic five or 10 minut to ga up, pay and be back on the road.Electr car like those made by TSLA have the advantag of be abl to be charg at home, but that take a long time. Accord to Tesla' figures, half an hour on a home charger get about 27 mile of drive range. And that doesn't help when you'r traveling.Th compani ha been build up a Supercharg network that take on the role of ga stations. A Supercharg is capabl of ad 270 mile of drive rang in 30 minutes, and can fulli charg a Tesla Model S with 90 kWh batteri in roughli 75 minutes.Each Supercharg locat isestim to cost TSLA between $100k and $175kto build, take 12-20 week to complete.TSLA Will Doubl It North American Locat in 2017Tesla' Supercharg network ha two challenges.First, it is much, much thinner than the nation' network of ga stations. In all of the U.S. Canada and Mexico,Tesla current ha just 373 Supercharg locations, with 2,636 connections. Mani of those Supercharg locat are concentr on the east and west coasts.Then there is the charg time. While fill your car with enough ga to go 500 mile might take five or 10 minutes, fulli charg a base Model S take 75 minutes.With Tesla ownership limit to earli adopt with rel deep pockets, the spars Supercharg network ha mostli been an annoy - someth Tesla owner learn to work around.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) Stock Is CRAZY Cheap,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTeva Pharmaceut Industri Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) desper need some good news head into it fourth quarter earn report. TEVA stock hit it lowest level in over a decad the week before, after it CEO resign abruptly.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Schedul (Modified)Th departur of CEO Erez Vigodman came amidst report of briberi investig in the company' home countri of Israel. And it came after a long declin in TEVA stock, driven by price pressure, question acquisitions, and a ""patent cliff"" for Teva Pharmaceutical' key drug, Copaxone.And while Q4 earn delivered, the news wasn't great. Revenu increas 33%, but that came almost sole from the acquisit ofAllergan plc's(NYSE:AGN) gener business. Teva Pharmaceut paid $40.5 billion in a transact that ha boost sale as well as Teva' debt load. Margin were pressured, reflect in non-GAAP EP that increas just 8% despit the 33% rise in sales.But the compani also reaffirm 2017 non-GAAP EP guidanc of $4.90-$5.30. That eas fear of anoth reduct in the 2017 outlook, which had been cut in Januari from $6-$6.50. The news wa enough to drive a ""relief rally"" in TEVA stock, which now ha climb more than 10% from it lows.Ther should be more upsid ahead, even if the road might be bumpy. Teva doe have numer risks, both near-term and long-term. But it also ha tremend potential, a cheap multiple, and a new CEO on the way. There' a turnaround opportun in TEVA stock and it doesn't look quit price in.Whi It' Crazi to Buy Teva StockAdmittedly, there are concern across the board for Teva stock. Thepat invalidationfor Copaxone, a multipl sclerosi treatment, put an estim 20% of revenue, and possibl 40%-plu of profit, at risk. On the Q4 call, CFO Eyal Desheh estim an $800 million cash flow impact in 2017, should competit enter immediately.That entranc - which would occur if Teva lose it appeal - also would shave 75 to 95 cent off EPS.Th combin of lower earn and higher debt after the Allergan deal rais anoth risk. Teva' leverag ratio (net debt to EBITDA) at the end of 2016 wa 4.7. That doesn't impli immedi risk of bankruptcy, to be sure. But Teva bond that matur in 2026 have fallen about 12% just sinc September. Clearly, the debt market are price in a greater, if still modest, possibl of a restructur that could wipe out TEVA stock.Th compani now face the challeng of find a new CEO.Both previou CEOsleft rel quickly, amid question of fit within Teva' cultur and clash with the company' board. The company' current bylaw requir the CEO to resid in Israel, though it' possibl those could be chang for the next candidate.9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99The bear case for TEVA stock is that, yes, it is cheap - and for good reason. Declin profits, a $36 billion debt load, concern about gener pricing, and the loss of Copaxon all present signific risks. And those risk justifi a 7x multipl to the midpoint of 2017 EP guidance.Whi Teva Stock Is a Buy NonethelessThos concern are valid. But they'r also backward-looking.Teva ha numer option to improv it situation, and interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said on the Q4 call that Teva would ""leav no stone unturned"" in consid those options.And what' import to keep in mind is that the situat isn't all that dire. Yes, bond have fallen; but the yield to matur still is just 4.4%, impli a veri low chanc of bankruptci over the next decade. The leverag ratio could move abov 5x if Copaxon competit move in; but that remain a manag level. Thi isn'tVal Pharmaceut Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX); Teva' back isn't against the wall.Th compani ha options. TEVA is target a 3.5x leverag ratio, and like will consid asset sale as a path to those levels. There' still the possibl of a split between the brand and gener businesses, someth Wall Street ha long targeted. (That decis appear up to the new CEO, per the Q4 call.)Copaxon sale and profit aren't go to zero, even if gener competit enter immediately. And the same goe for Teva Pharmaceut earnings. Thi remain the largest gener drug manufactur in the world base on revenue. With rise health care cost a concern pretti much everywhere, and drug price a key part of those concerns, that' a major long-term competit advantag for Teva.Th Appl iPhon 8 Will Be Revolutionari (AAPL)And TEVA stock is cheap - even assum the worst about Copaxone. Use the low end of 2017 guidanc and the high end of the guid Copaxon impact still put 2017 EP near $4, and TEVA stock' P/E multipl below 10. Simpli stabil the busi at those level like impli a 12-13 multipl - and get TEVA stock to $50.It' alway difficult to time the bottom in ani stock. But the Q4 earn from Teva Pharmaceut seem to impli that the compani at least ha a handl on it challenges. Look forward, the debt load isn't so big that the compani is forc to do anything, and a new CEO will bring fresh eyes.Ther are concerns, to be sure. But Teva Pharmaceut ha a lot of tool still at it dispos to answer those concerns, and push TEVA stock higher.Th author ha no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialWatch Cisco Systems, Inc.

A Slight Negative for This Apple Inc. Supplier Emerges,2/23/2017,"Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.(NYSE: TSM) is the world' largest contract chip manufacturer. It manufactur chip for some of the largest, most power compani likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well as for small chip compani you might not have ever heard of.TSMC is in the uniqu situat of have a veri strong posit insid of Apple' iPhon line of smartphon -- it is believ to be the exclus manufactur of Apple' custom-design A10 processor and it is also believ to be the manufactur of theQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon X12 andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) XMM 7360 cellular modem found insid of each iPhon sold today.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Go forward, it look as though TSMC is set to see revenu from iPhon cellular modem vanish.Gon either thi cycle, or nextIf Appl choos to reus the Snapdragon X12 modem as well as adopt Intel' XMM 7480 cellular modem for the upcom iPhon product cycle, then TSMC should enjoy anoth year of cellular modem revenu (sinc the XMM 7480 is also believ to be manufactur at TSMC).However, after that it is like that Appl will adopt the Intel XMM 7560 cellular modem as well as either the Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 or Snapdragon X20 modem (if it doesn't ultim adopt one of them thi cycle).Th Snapdragon X16 is manufactur bySamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) on it 14-nanomet LPP technolog and the Snapdragon X20 is manufactur by Samsung use it 10-nanomet LPE technology.Th Intel XMM 7560 is, unlik previou Intel modems, manufactur by Intel itself use some variant of it 14-nanomet manufactur technology.So, at some point within the next iPhon cycl or two, Appl is like go to be sourc modem from both Qualcomm and Intel that aren't manufactur by TSMC.What doe thi mean for TSMC' business?If we assum that thi busi is worth someth on the order of $1 billion in annual revenu (200 million unit multipli by a rough estim of $5 per unit), then -- all els equal -- TSMC stand to see a roughli 3% revenu declin from the eventu loss of thi busi (base on current analyst consensu which call for TSMC to rake in about $32.22 billion in revenu thi year).That' certainli less than ideal, but such a loss isn't go to dramat impact the company' financi position. After all, the compani still benefit from the growth of the overal smartphon market (a it is a critic supplier of mani key smartphon processor makers) and I wouldn't be surpris to see silicon content within smartphon continu to grow in the year ahead as smartphon continu to integr more featur and functionality.In other words, TSMC should be abl to more than make up the potenti declin elsewher within the mobil market.What about for Intel' and Samsung's?Samsung' contract chip manufactur busi use to reli on the manufactur of Apple' A-seri applic processors, but it seem to have lost that busi to TSMC for the forese future. Get some logic silicon content in the iPhon again via the manufactur of Qualcomm' modem certainli can't hurt.A similar argument appli to Intel. The compani is look to expand it total address market partli to grow revenu and partli to continu to have enough chip scale to keep it expens factori fill with chips. By manufactur and ship ten of millions, if not more than 100 million cellular baseband chip (eventually) annually, the compani ha quit a lot of ""guaranteed"" volum for it factori year-in and year-out.In other words, I'd say that TSMC lose busi to Intel and Samsung is probabl more of a posit for the latter two' busi than it is a neg for TSMC.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Needs a New Growth Driver,2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh bull/bear argument for and againstAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is pretti simple. AAPL stock bull argu that the stock is simpli too cheap. Appl is a great company, with roughli $30 per share in net cash; yet Appl stock trade at basic 10x next year' earn plu cash. Investor are act as if Appl earn will declin go forward - which make no sens for what remain the world' most popular consum good compani (and the world' most valuabl stock).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBear reply, in essence, that AAPL stockshouldget a multipl befit a declin company. As popular as the iPhon is, competit is intense, and onli get tougher.And as smartphon becom more commoditized, the edg that the iPhon ha over, say, aSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi - let alon Chines competitor - will narrow. That should pressur pricing, margin and Appl shares.With Appl stock at an all-tim high, the bull are win the argument at the moment. But from a long-term standpoint, the bear have a point. AAPL may not be the next Gateway Computer, but commodit is a risk. Appl need anoth growth driver to keep it stock rise over the long-term. The compani hasn't quit found the right product yet; however, and it' not sure what it will be.Appl Stock Ha Been Valu Base on the iPhoneIt' not hard to come to the conclus that AAPL stock is directli correl to iPhon sales. It wa iPhone-driven optim that drove Appl share from under $100 (pre-split; equival to ~$12.50 now) in 2009 to $100 by 2012. Sinc then, Appl stock ha declin sharpli twice.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy and Hold ForeverTh first time wa in 2013. In fiscal 2013 (AAPL fiscal year end in September), the iPhon growth rate slow sharply: iPhon unit sale growth drop from 73% in FY12 to 20.2% in FY13, and those fear knock down Appl shares. The second declin came in between 2015 and 2016, dure a year where iPhon revenuedropped12% year-over-year on an 8% decreas in unit sales.Look backwards, it certainli seem like AAPL stock is driven by sentiment toward the iPhone. There' one key reason for that: the rest of Appl ha been consistently, and almost incred stagnant. Here' Appl revenu ex-iPhon sale over the last five fiscal year (per AAPL filings):2012: $77.8 billion2013: $79.6 billion2014: $80.8 billion2015: $78.7 billion2016: $78.9 billionObviously, those sale have come from differ sources. Mac revenu have been rel stable, in the $21 to $25 billion range. iPod sale have faded, but have been offset by the modest growth in Appl Watch sales, leav ""other products"" revenu rather flat. iPad sale have fallen from $32 billion in FY13 to bare $20 billion last year; growth in servic (iTunes, Appl Music, Appl Pay, etc.) ha offset that decline.But the point is that, other than the iPhone, Appl stock realli isn't a growth stock. In fact, it look a lot like the bear view Appl as a whole. And that rais the question of if AAPL can becom a true growth stock, and drive upsid from it current all-tim highs.But AAPL Stock Need Anoth HitAt thi point, I wouldn't bet against AAPL stock, but I'm skeptic the compani can realli drive growth beyond the iPhone. A simpl breakdown of the ~$79 billion in trail twelve-month non-iPhon revenu show there realli isn't much in the pipeline. $23 billion (30%) come from Mac notebook and desktops. That' a great, high-margin product, but overal desktop/notebook sale are declin and Mac revenu declin 10% in FY16 (it did rise 7% in Q1 FY17); $19 billion (24%) come from the iPad.Thos sale are declining, fall 23% in FY15, 11% in FY16 and a concern 22% in Q1. Servic revenu is doubl what it wa after FY12, and drive about one-third of non-iPhon revenue. But those busi still compris just ~12% of total sales.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itch to Break All-Tim HighsOth product make up the rest of non-iPhon revenue, with that segment includ Beat headphones, Appl TV, the iPod (yes, Appl still sell them) and, of course, Appl Watch. Appl Watch ha been cite as a potenti driver for AAPL stock, but Appl still doesn't break out revenue. CEO Tim Cook did say on the AAPL Q1 earn call that Watch sale hit an all-tim high in the Decemb quarter.But ""other products"" sale over the last four quarter still are under $11 billion. That' about 5% of total revenue. And Appl Watch is onli a portion of those sales.iPhon Relianc Could Hurt Appl StockAnd that' the key problem for Appl stock at the highs, in my opinion. The iPhon is so domin that everyth els pare in comparison. The Appl Watch would be consid a success for nearli everi compani on Earth. But it revenu over the last year is probably, at best, in the rang of $6 billion. Over the same period, the iPhon generated$139 billionin revenue.Th point is that AAPL stock remain indistinguish from the iPhone. Appl Watch, Appl Pay, Beat and other ancillari product are good products, and drive excel sales. But the iPhon is such a phenomenon that they almost don't matter - and it' almost imposs to creat a product that can drive anywher near that level of success. And I believ that creat a long-term risk for AAPL stock, even if that risk isn't play out at the moment.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best Oil Stock to Buy Now for Big-Tim Gains7 S&P 500 Stock Pois For Explos GrowthTh postWhi Appl Inc.

4 Stocks at 52-Week Highs That Are Still Worth Buying Today,2/22/2017,"While we Fool are gener bargain hunters, we recogn that some compani are so fantast that it can make sens to buy them while they'r on the upswing. With that in mind, we ask a team of Fool to each highlight a stock trade near it 52-week that is still worth buy today. Read on to see whi they selectedVisa(NYSE: V) ,Brookfield Infrastructur Partners(NYSE: BIP) ,Paycom Software(NYSE: PAYC) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Charg ahead with thi payment-network giantDan Caplinger(Visa):Financi stock have skyrocket sinc the presidenti elect in November, as investor hope that deregul in the bank and invest industri will lead to faster growth and new prospect for busi expans in the month and year ahead. Yet Visa stand to win in a coupl of ways, and it' better posit to prosper no matter what happen to the global economi and the state of regul in the U.S. financi industri go forward.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Unlik banks, Visa carri no credit risk with it payment network. Instead, it simpli take a small cut of transact use it infrastructure, and as more peopl use electron payment to make purchases, Visa ha carv out it share of the grow market.Ther are a coupl of reason to be bullish on Visa even after it big share-pric gains. First, most indic suggest that the econom expans is continu in the U.S., and that should spur greater consum activ that can help contribut to greater overal purchas and transact volumes. Also, Visa recent acquir Visa Europe, reintegr it global oper and put it in a posit to benefit from recoveri elsewher in the world. Combin that with emerg market economi where consum are onli now start to adopt electron payments, and you can see how Visa could continu to make progress despit alreadi have reward sharehold with 25% gain over the past year.Rid high but undervaluedMatt DiLallo(Brookfield Infrastructur Partners):Unit of Brookfield Infrastructur Partner are up more than 50% over the past year, recent hit a new 52-week high. Fuel that growth wa the company' strong show in 2016 when it grew fund from oper (FFO) by 17% after complet a slew of growth project and acquisitions. Those strateg growth initi enabl the compani to increas it distribut by 11% for 2017.The compani still ha plenti of growth left in the pipeline. In fact, it ha ad $1.4 billion in new organ project to it backlog and is close to close three more acquisitions. These new addit have the potenti to drive FFO up doubl digit again thi year if everyth goe accord to plan, well ahead of the company' long-term guidanc for 5% to 9% annual FFO growth.That said, despit the robust growth in the pipeline, Brookfield' unit trade for a higher yield compar to it peers. Becaus of that, Brookfield believ the market ha significantli undervalu it units. In fact, as the follow slide suggests, unit would trade for around $50 if the market valu it yield closer to the peer group average:Imag source: Brookfield Infrastructur Partner Investor Presentation.Whil unit aren't quit as undervalu as they had been, they'r still a bargain compar to what Brookfield believ they'r worth. That suggest the potenti for more upsid on the horizon, especi as the compani continu build and buy asset that grow it cash flow and distribution. Speak of which, at a nearli 5% yield, investor get paid a pretti penni while wait for the market to wake up and realiz that Brookfield still trade at a hefti discount.A bore but mission-crit serviceBrian Feroldi(Paycom Software):I don't know mani peopl that would show up at work if they weren't receiv a paycheck. Employ certainli know this, too, which is whi they take payrol process so seriously. And yet, legaci payrol system can be a big hassl to deal with sinc they gener don't play well with other HR systems.Chad Richinson certainli understand thi dilemma, which is whi he found Paycom Softwar back in 1998. Hi solut wa to creat a softwar system that handl multipl HR function from a single, cloud-bas system, therebi make it far more attract to employers.Paycom' solut ha proven to be a big hit with small and medium-s busi everywhere. The compani now count more than 17,800 client on it platform. With more employ sign on everi day, Paycom' revenu and profit have been soaring.Paycom'sstrong growth rateshav certainli caught Wall Street' attention, push it stock to a fresh 52-week high. Take a closer look at the company' performance, it is not hard to figur out whi Wall Street is excited. Revenu grew by 35% and exceed expectations. Net incom soar by 80% and also blast past analyst' projections. Custom retent rate remain strong, and manag is guid for revenu growth of nearli 30% in 2017.While Paycom' stock is most certainli pricey -- the company' trail PE ratio is 71 -- I can't help but feel that the blister revenu growth and soar profit more than justifi it high valuation. That put Paycom high on my shop list, even though share have alreadi enjoy a great run.Appl is still a scream buyTravi Hoium(Apple):Crit can critic Apple' level of innov or the design of the new iPhon or Macs, but it' tough to critic the company' incred earn machine. The compani ha a net cash balanc of $158.5 million and in the last year earn $45.2 billion. And the compani doesn't show ani sign of let up it earn power.Th iPhon ha becom such a power devic that custom are lock into the Appl ecosystem almost from the moment they buy one. And own an iPhon make custom more like to buy a Mac, Appl TV, iPad, or even AirPods. The fact that everyth work togeth so well, and oper system updat come regularli is incred valuabl if you'v ever tri use competitor like Android or Samsung' Smart TV oper system.With Apple' share at a 52-week high, the stock isn't as attract as it wa a few month ago, and the 1.7% dividend yield won't wow most investors. But share still onli trade at 16 time trail earnings, and that' without consid the $158.5 billion in net cash on the balanc sheet. The iPhon is also show no sign of slow down as a technolog powerhouse, and the ecosystem of product and app surround the smartphon will gener valu for Appl for the forese future. Even as the largest compani in the world, Appl is still a stock worth buying.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Benefits Of Investing In Companies With A High Rate Of Discretionary Disclosure,2/22/2017,"ByStefano De Caterina:Corpor disclosur and shareholders' valu creationTh posit outcom of discretionari disclosur are variou and can benefit both compani and their shareholders. I will focu here on the benefit for the latter.Whilst the mandatori disclosur is impos by legisl or regul (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S. and the European Transpar Direct in the E.U.), the discretionari disclosur consist of ani addit inform a company' manag intend to provid the investor with.makeArticleAd();Most of the studi show that a disclosur increas creat valu for the shareholders. For instance, a studi conduct by Standard & Poor' show (see the chart below) that compani with higher transpar and disclosur (measur by the S&P transpar score) have a higher P/BV ratio.Source: Standard & Poor'sTh S&P transpar score take into account the quantiti of disclosure: the more inform is given (i.e. inform about ownership structur and shareholders' rights, inform about board and manag process, financi and oper information), the higher the score is. The same research also prove that firm with high disclosur and transpar have a lower market risk as show in the chart below:Source: Standard & Poor'sOth studi focus on event such as the introduct of regul (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) also verifi and confirm that disclosur either mandatori or discretionari creat valu for the shareholders.A crucial role in convey the disclosur to the investor is play by the Investor Relations.Th Nation Investor Relat Institut (NIRI) defin the Investor Relat as the:""Strateg manag respons that integr finance, communication, market and secur law complianc to enabl the most effect two-way commun between a company, the financi community, and other constituencies, which ultim contribut to a company' secur achiev fair valuation"".Bas on thi definition, we can assum that if a compani suppli it sharehold with a complete, timely, reliable, punctual and adequ flow of financi inform relat to it business, it will definit help investor make better invest decis and allow it stock price to align progress with it fair value.In thi sense, investor relat help share price to achiev a fair valuation. Valu gap between market valu and fair valu tend to diminish becaus investor believ manag can accomplish what it say through the disclosure(manag credibility).A flat or neg quarter will not be an automat sell signal becaus investor will seek for explan by the manag and, when convinc that fundament are still strong and growing, they will be more like to hold their share or even increas their posit becaus they trust the company' manag and, today more than ever, in the fallout of financi crisis, market run more on trust than money. As a matter of fact, the 2008 financi crisi and the ensu five year of econom turmoil clearli reveal the insuffici of disclosures, especi in the case of financi institutions.Mor transparencyFirst of all, make more financi inform avail mean more transpar for it investor who can make more appropri and accur invest decis base on a larger amount of data to evalu and compare.Voluntari disclosur decreas the investor' inform asymmetri to the extent of it usefulness. The degre of it use depend on it relevance, reliability, timeliness, and clarity.Moreover, the market tend to valu more compani present clear and easy-to-understand financi statement than those file complex and opaqu ones.Mani are the commun channel through which investor relat can convey the company' disclosur to the financi community. The main channel employ are the press releases, investor and analyst meetings, earn guidelines, investor presentations, and the Investor Relat page on the company' website.Investor are often concern not with past earnings, but rather with futur ones, thu the way a compani commun that financi inform through the commun channel mention abov might convinc or not the investor to buy it stocks.In addition, invest in busi which implement an effect voluntari disclosur polici mean invest into firm manag by credibl and reliabl managers; in other words, transpar lead to credibl and trust.Mor liquidityTh implement of an effect disclosur polici aim to reduc the inform asymmetri between manag and investor will entail a higher liquid of the share and increas the company' visibility, therebi attract more analyst to cover the stock and more institut investor to buy the company' share whose price will eventu go up with a clear and obviou advantag for all the investors.A more liquid stock also mean a reduc bid-off spread (the empir measur of market liquidity) for the investors, which mean a cheaper cost of trading. In conclusion, an effect disclosur polici reduc inform asymmetri and increas liquid in the equiti market.Low debtIncreas liquid also bring about a lower cost of capital, thu the compani will have to bear a smaller burden of debt, which is great news for the company' investors.Th major of studi have confirm that the cost of capit decreas as the company' risk percept dissip within the market and, as a consequence, the firm will be abl not onli to financ it invest at a lower cost, but also rais equiti capit more easily. Ultimately, disclosur facilit extern financing, investments, and growth, which will be eventu reflect in the rise of the stock price.Bi no surprise, the lead IT consult firm Infosi (INFY) rank among the three top compani for disclosur on it domest market (BSE100) ha approxim a 5.90% weight averag cost of capit vs. a 45.20% return on invest capital. In other word it can gener excess return on the invest 7.6 time more than it cost of capital. Besid that, Infosi can sport a 10-year track record of consist growth in sales, profits, free cash flow and dividends.Stock price appreci and lower volatilityFirm with high level of disclosur have a higher associ with stock price increas than those with low level of inform disclosure.A veri interest studi publish in the ""Financi Management"" journal compar an invest made in high-disclosur compani with an invest made in low-disclosur companies, and it show that the high-disclosur portfolio outperform the low-disclosur portfolio by an averag of 7% per year over a period of 14 years.Oth studi have prove that more transpar firm benefit from a reduct in the volatil of return which for the investor mean less risk and more stabl return over time.Th increas of liquid attract more institut investor who gener more volum and therefor push the stocks' price up. In addition, the increas of the analyst coverag and the set up of target price might also contribut in put further upward pressur on the stocks' price.Thestatu quoof disclosur and transpar in the corpor worldIn 2014 Transpar Intern ((TI)), the watchdog that monitor the intern corrupt among countri and corpor publish a rank of the top 10 most transpar compani and the least transpar firm in the world among the 124 largest publicly-list compani base on an index which take into account anti-corrupt program adopt by the rank compani and their overal organiz transparency. Seven of the top compani are from Europ while eight of the bottom 10 compani are from Asia.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)TI also publish a report whose find are veri interest but also surprising.In term of sectors, telecom and oil/ga compani lead the way whilst consum services, financial, tech and healthcar firm are the least transparent. Geographically, EU compani score highest in organiz transpar with an averag of 54% and U.S. firm score the lowest at 24%.U.S. tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Appl (NASDAQ:AAPL), Googl (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) all score less than three out of 10.Anoth American famou firm, Berkshir Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B), Warren Buffett' conglomerate, also had a bad performance, rank among the last 10.""Tech compani are drive chang that are make our societi more open and accountable. They should be set an exampl for other compani on transparency"" said Cobu de Swardt, TI' manag director.Th report also show the posit impact of strong legislation, with U.K. compani score 90% on averag compar to 20% in China.Accord to the report, financi sector compani still should be more transpar and account to the public if they want to win back public trust which is yet faltering.Th report urg multin compani to seek more transpar by disclos the subsidiari through which they oper in differ countri which are often imposs to trace. Obtain thi inform through a country-by-countri report is import sinc it would help peopl understand the impact of multin compani in their own country. In addition, through a full disclosur of corpor holdings, investor can gain more knowledg of financi flow such as intra-compani transfer and payment to governments.Whil all the evalu German compani disclos all their subsidiari abroad, no Chines compani disclos ani financi data in ani of the 59 foreign countri where they operate.In the country-by-countri disclosur ranking, more than 50 compani score an embarrass 0% and onli three perform abov the 50% level, the pre-tax profit be the least disclos financi inform while the revenu be the most disclosed. Amazon, Apple, Googl and IBM all fail to publish a full list of countri in which their subsidiari operate.Th watchdog in it report also highlight the import for the investor to be awar of the anti-corrupt polici establish by the compani they want to invest in sinc thi inform will help them evalu better the risk associ with the investment. U.K. compani perform best on anti-corrupt whilst Chines and Japanes compani are the poorest perform in both dimensions.In conclusion, invest in compani with a high rate of discretionari disclosur and transpar can dramat increas the overal shareholders' valu and substanti reduc the risk associ with the investment.Se alsoTh iShar MSCI Malaysia ETF Is A Specul Buyon seekingalpha.com"

(AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?,2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI stumbl across a predict last week that would impress even Mad Money' Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();Accord to a recent report from Oxfam, an intern charit organization, Bill Gate ha a shot at becom the world' first trillionaire. Oxfam specul that if the return on the tech mogul' $75 billion fortun in the next 25 year are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gate ha a shot at jump the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man ha a shot at becom a trillionaire, certainli one of theS&P 500′ biggest compani ha a shot at becom the world' first $1 trillion company?Turn out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 compani with a shot at break the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest compani on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook' share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) ha a market cap of $400 billion. Share would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) ha a market cap of $498 billion. Share would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is current worth $570 billion. Share would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believ everi one of these compani will eventu be worth $1 trillion. However, one other compani will beat them all to it.Thank to a varieti of factors,Appl Inc.(AAPL) is set to becom the first $1 trillion compani in the world in the next five years.Th compani ha been on a roll. After beat fourth-quart earn by 4%, share just hit a new all-tim high abov $135.That give Appl a market cap of $710 billion, make it the largest compani in the S&P 500. It ha also place Appl within strike distanc of the $1 trillion mark. Share of Appl would onli need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If it current valuat stay the same, Appl would need to grow earn by 8% annual in the next five year to hit that target. As it stands, Appl is expect to grow earn by 8% thi year and anoth 13% in 2018. Those two year alon get Appl almost half way to 50% earn growth.But even if Apple' earn grow slower than expected, it ha an ace up it sleeve.Appl Ha $246 Billion In Cash On It Balanc SheetApple' cash posit is larger than the GDP of most countries.

It forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500 20. That lower valuat exist despit the fact that Appl is project to grow earn faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Techn speak that mean Appl should be trade with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Appl trade with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, share would share would climb 25%, give Appl a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Invest In AppleApple' pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold ha attract the attent of the world' greatest investor. In recent regulatori filings, Berkshir reveal it had quadrupl it ownership in Appl to 57 million shares.

Is GoPro Inc. Stock a Buy After Its Earnings Sell-Off?,2/22/2017,"It' been a rough past few year forGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) stock. Surg to promin in the post-recession, venture-capital-fuel ""age of the unicorn,"" GoPro and it innov action camera initi drew comparison to a youngApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , the poster child a for success hardware-driven electron business.That comparison ha turn out to be optimistic, to say the least, and GoPro share have march downward in the roughli two year sinc it stock price bubbl burst.makeArticleAd();GPROdata byYChartsAft GoPro engag in some pain restructur in 2016, it earn report earlier thi month offer investor a glimps into what it see around the bend for it business. Investor respond by send it share southbound.But how low is too low? With it share in the tank, let' see whether GoPro is final cheap enough to deserv investors' interest.GoPro earnings: What we learnedJust about everyth that could go wrong for GoPro did in 2016. Dure it Q3 confer call, the compani alert investor to the product problem that affect the company' then-forthcom HERO5 Black action camera. The Q3 spillov effect from it product issu hamper GoPro' abil to suppli enough HERO5 Black devic to some of it key retail partners. These retailers, in turn, pull promot support for the HERO5 Black, which caus the compani to captur less holiday season demand than it had anticipated.Imag source: GoProCompound it problems, GoPro encount issu with the launch of it much-tout Karma drone, as problem with the latch that held it batteri in place caus the Karma to lose power in midair. GoPro halt product of the Karma until a redesign latch could be introduced, and that setback also led to underwhelm Karma sale dure the fourth quarter.Th quarter wasn't without some positives, though. For the quarter, sale rose 24% to $540.6 million, the second largest revenu total for a quarter in GoPro' 14 year in operation. The compani also enact a major cost restructuring, includ kill it GoPro Entertain divis and elimin 200 full-tim employe -- effort that the compani expect will reduc it oper cost structur by $100 million annual to an annual run rate below $600 million.In the year ahead, GoPro plan to focu it effort on a small hand of initiatives, includ increas it emphasi on it image-edit software, Quik; expand it brand reach by creat new way to engag it user base; grow internationally; and continu to creat compel hardware. All of thi sound encouraging, in theory. However, I'm still not sold that the company' new strateg vision and increas focu on execut are enough to creat a sustain profit business.Stil skepticalGoPro' strategi make perfect sense. Creat new type of devices, like the Karma, and attempt to creat an end-to-end softwar and hardwar ecosystem should help expand the breadth and depth of it busi footprint. Thi strategi mirror the close ecosystem that Appl ha employ to such spectacular result sinc the launch of the iPod. However, GoPro' devic differ from Apple' in a few import way that reduc the strength of GoPro' busi model in comparison.Imag source: GoPro.Th first is the size of it address market. For the iPhone, Appl enjoy a potenti address market of all smartphon user -- which mean billion of potenti customers, compar with the sever million user who buy GoPro each year. Moreover, the smartphone' place as the Swiss Armi knife of our digit live make it an essenti tool for mani consumers, compar with the more recreat natur of GoPro' products. Finally, Apple' close app ecosystem provid a far richer set of user experi than GoPro'sTh point here isn't just to compar and contrast Appl and GoPro. Rather, we'r look at the way in which a consum hardwar busi model need to differenti itself to produc meaning profit. When it come to the size of it market, the import of it product to it users, and the sticki of it software, GoPro fall well short of Apple' templat for success.Th analyst figur further bear thi out. Wall Street' estim see GoPro gener single-digit sale growth and continu net loss both thi year and next. So while GoPro is inde employ a sensibl strategi to improv it prospects, invest in share of the action-camera pioneer still seem like a riski proposition.10 stock we like better than GoProWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Garmin (GRMN)'s Remarkable Turnaround,2/22/2017,"Corpor turnaround are a wonder thing to behold, but are quit rare, particularli in certain industries. Consum electronics, for example, is a busi domin by trend with phenomen growth possibl when someth catch on. The flip side of that, however, is that when a brand lose it luster, the declin is usual as rapid as the rise. That is what make the turnaround achiev at Garmin (GRMN) so remarkable.A the below 5 year chart for the stock abli demonstrates, from mid-2013 on GRMN wa all the rage for a year or so. The company’ GP navig system had dealt with some seriou competit from other hand held devic and reach the point that manufactur dream of, where their brand name becom synonym with the product.Th thing that peopl attach to their dashboard to give direct was, to a larg percentag of the population, a Garmin, regardless of the actual brand of the device.makeArticleAd();Th stock react accordingly, almost doubl in a year. The peak came at the end of June 2014, and then just eighteen month later, at the end of 2015, GRMN wa back around the $33 mark from which the rise began. At that time forecast of the company’ demis were commonplace, if a littl premature.A Appl map gain ground and built in navig system becam standard in mani cars, dashboard GP devic began to seem anachronistic. Throughout 2015, Garmin post neg year on year growth in both revenu and earn and the stock wa written off by many.Cliff Pemble, the CEO of the compani sinc 2013, however, had other ideas. He took a gambl and promot a focu on wearabl technology. At the time that wa not seen as a smart move by mani people. After all, it meant take on not just establish compani in that area such as Fitbit (FIT), but also Appl (AAPL), who were move into the watch business. If today’ releas of Q4 2016 earn is ani guide, though, that opinion could not have been more wrong.Garmin report big beat on revenu ($860.8 million vs. $800 million estimated) and Earn per Share (73 cent vs. 58 cent estimated). Even more significantli in mani ways, they also boost their revenu outlook for 2017 to abov current Wall Street estimates, and said that it wa growth in the wearabl area that wa in larg part drive the performance.GRMN had alreadi gain around twenti three percent over the past year, but jump anoth nine percent or so in earli trade thi morn as a result of those numbers.It could be argu that as a result of that, ani valu that there may have been in the stock is now gone. A quick glanc at the usual valuat metric would support that view, but the long term case for GRMN is a littl more subtle. As I said earlier, turnaround of thi magnitud are rare anywhere, but especi so in consum electronics. The fact that Pembl wa abl to engin thi one, though, is a veri good reason to own the stock.Recogn the fact that the market wa chang and make chang to adjust for those chang took a lot of guts, but also demand skill execution. That combin of be prepar to take calcul risk and have the skill to execut a turnaround effect is exactli what investor should look for in a CEO, and the knowledg that at Garmin there is a manag team that fit that bill is enough to make GRMN a good long term investment."
3 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks to Buy,2/22/2017,"Warren Buffett ownsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) , andWel Fargo(NYSE: WFC) stock becaus they'r great compani that he wa abl to buy at a fair price. But there' anoth reason whi investor might want to follow in hi footstep and add these stock to their portfolios: all three have a solid histori of dividend increases.Back on topWarren Buffett said it wa hi lieuten that were initi respons for ad Appl toBerkshir Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) portfolio, but given Appl ha becom Berkshir Hathaway' sixth biggest stock, it seem the Oracl of Omaha ha also given Appl hi blessing.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Berkshir Hathaway bought Appl share when they were on the down-and-out becaus exist iPhon user were hold off on upgrades. Sinc then, Apple' share have climb on optim that sale would pick up in the wake of competitor stumbl and new product launches.Last quarter, that optim wa reward with record iPhone, Mac, Appl Watch, and servic sales. Record result in the company' servic segment wa especi good news becaus it' high-margin revenu that can help support profit and futur dividend increases. Last quarter, servic revenu grew 13% quarter-over-quart and 18% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. The strong result produc oper cash flow of $27 billion last year, and as a result, the compani return nearli $15 billion to investor via share buyback and dividend payments.Thank to a 10% dividend increas last April, the company' dividend per share is current $0.57 per quarter, which is 21% higher than it wa in 2014. If sale continu to grow, investor could get reward with anoth dividend increas soon, and if Donald Trump make good on promis to allow compani like Appl to repatri cash held overseas, then the compani could have even greater dividend flexibility.Admittedly, Apple' 1.7% dividend yield isn't the biggest yield out there, but thi is a top-tier compani with a rock-solid balanc sheet, and given the potenti to consist boost it dividend over time, I think it' a stock that' worthi of own in incom portfolios.AAPL Dividenddata byYCharts.Fli highWarren Buffett is make a 60 million share, $3 billion bet that Delta Air Lines' futur is brighter than it past. Hi stake is particularli signific becaus it suggest Buffett believ there' been a fundament chang in an industri that he onc label as a ""terrible"" industri for investors.Perhap Buffett' chang of heart is due to an industri wide shift in how airlin approach their business. In the past, airlin increas the number of rout they offer and compet fierc on price. Today, they focu on fewer rout and fuller flights, rather than price wars.Thi approach ha help airlin deliv more consist profit, and with the U.S. economi expanding, that could be good news for futur dividend increases. Last year, Delta Air Lines' revenu passeng mile were up 1.7%, and with economist predict GDP and person incom growth in 2017, there' reason to think that passeng mile will climb again thi year.If so, then Delta Air Line may have plenti of financi flexibl to return more money to investors. In 2016, it oper cash flow wa $7 billion and it net incom wa $4 billion, and that allow the compani to spend $3.1 billion on share buyback and dividends. The compani increas it quarterli dividend payment 50% last year, and at $0.203 per share, it dividend is significantli higher than the $0.063 per share it paid investor in 2014.Rise rates, bigger profitsWel Fargo is Berkshir Hathaway' second biggest position, and although Well Fargo' share tumbl last year on news that market incent caus worker tocreate""fake"" accounts, share have recov their loss and are trade near 52-week highs.Wel Fargo' rebound ha a lot to do with the Fed' increasingli hawkish approach to interest rates.Ov the past few years, the spread between bank lend rate and borrow cost ha been hamstrung by rock-bottom fed fund rate and govern bond buy program that have depress Treasuri yields. Recently, the Fed ha been threaten higher rate to curb inflat risks, and in December, it bump up rate by 25 basi points. Industri watcher think anoth 25 basi point increas could be come soon.If so, then it would be good news for Well Fargo. The company' interest rate sensit forecast suggest it could enjoy up to a 5% earn tailwind over the next two years, if interest rate climb more quickli than it' modeling.If rise rate boost profit, then it could help Well Fargo convinc regul to OK a dividend increase. Currently, Well Fargo is pay sharehold $0.38 per share per quarter dividend, up from $0.225 cent per share in 2012. The bank could also get addit wiggl room on it dividend depend on how regulatori reform in Washington pan out. Currently, Well Fargo ha to get a green light from regul befor return money to investors, but that could conceiv chang under Donald Trump.10 stock we like better than Well FargoWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation's 5G Apple Inc. iPhone Opportunity,2/22/2017,"Microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) surpris mani when it wa reveal that it had won a signific portion of the cellular modem order forApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7 seri smartphones.Th company' public commentari suggest that thi isn't just a proverbi flash in the pan, either -- Intel seem to have theiPhon 8(or whatev Appl call the follow-on devic to thi year' iPhon 7 series) as well as thefollow-on to thatin the bag.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();In thi article, I'd like to go over whi I think there' an opportun for Intel to gain dollar content share at Appl with the 2018 iPhone.Th shift to 5GBoth Intel and wireless chip giantQualcommboth intend to sampl 5G modem in 2017 with commerci shipment begin in 2018.To my knowledge, both companies' 5G modem solut will requir separ 4G LTE modem (either as discret part or integr in the smartphon applic processor) for phone implement the 5G solut to work on today' 4G networks.Appl wa late to adopt LTE rel to some of it peer in the smartphon market, but given that Appl ha ""grown up"" quit a bit from a technic perspect (substanti higher research and develop budget) and the industri ha gottenmuchmor competit (forc Appl to tri to adopt cutting-edg technolog for it devices), it may be one of the first to deploy 5G modems.Intel' opportunityShould Appl choos to adopt 5G function in it 2018 iPhon models, thi could be a solid win for Intel' cellular modem business.Indeed, if Intel goe from sell a singl LTE baseband (and associ components) to sell both an LTE baseband as well as a 5G modem (and ani addit components), then it make sens that the chipmaker' dollar content per iPhon could increase.Given that Intel' onli signific exposur to the larg smartphon chip market is via the sale of cellular modem to Apple, a big boost in dollar content at Appl should mean a big boost in the revenu -- and ultim profit -- that Intel can harvest from the smartphon market.A big step for Intel' modem business, a small step for Intel in totalIntel is an extrem larg company, gener nearli $60 billion in revenu dure 2016. Intel' revenu run rate from sale of modem to Appl is like in the ballpark of $1 billion per year (assum $10 per modem, 100 million iPhon unit with Intel modem sold per year).If Intel were to see it dollar content rise by 50%, then roughli $1 billion in annual sale becom $1.5 billion; a doubl of dollar content would mean that $1 billion in annual sale goe up to $2 billion.Of course, Intel is alreadi invest significantli to develop these cellular modems, so the more revenu that the compani can wring out of those investments, the better. However, ani potenti revenu growth from addit dollar content in a futur iPhon isn't go to be a game changer for Intel stock.To put thing into perspective, though, few thing have the potenti to move the needl for Intel stock -- what the compani need to do (and ha been doing) is look to capit on as mani reason size opportun as possibl in the hope that, in aggregate, they add up to enough addit revenu to deliv revenu growth even as it largest busi (person comput processors) declines.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Apple Isn't Buying Netflix,2/22/2017,"We'll never hear the end of the buyout buzz when it come toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) . As long as it remain the top dog in premium video stream and the nich is still boom there will alway be chatter about how good Netflix would look on the arm of a tech or media giant.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a potenti buyer that come up everi so often, and it did so again in aCNBC articlelast night. Anita Balakrishnan' piec argu that the ""best argument"" for Appl buy Netflix is that App Store spend on entertain program is soaring, and the consum tech giant may as well nab the top dog to beef up it grow servic revenue.Don't wait up for a wed invitation.makeArticleAd();A Motley Fool social media poll -- gaug investor opinion on a potenti deal between Appl and Netflix -- ha ""No Chance"" as the runaway answer with 48% of the vote among four choic as of last night.Wil Appl buy Netflix in 2017?- The Motley Fool (@themotleyfool)Februari 22, 2017Let' go over a few of the reason whi Appl buy Netflix doesn't make a lot of sense.Appl buy Netflix? I'v seenStrang Things. Imag source: Netflix.1. Appl isn't go to play favoritesTh CNBC articl lean ondata from Sensor Tower, show that the App Store' Entertain categori saw spend soar 130% over the past year. Netflix' chunk of that busi is grow even faster, go from $7.9 million in gross revenu dure the fourth quarter of 2015 to more than $58 million a year later. Netflix began monet subscript through Apple' app marketplac dure the fourth quarter of 2015.The growth may seem impressive, but what will Appl be telegraph if it snap up Netflix? Develop turn to mobil marketplac becaus of the level play field. Fellow video app may not feel that the play field is veri level with the top dog in Apple' arsenal.Appl ha homegrown app in stream entertainment. However, Appl Music is not the nich leader. Yes, it did buy Beat Music, but mostli for it headphon business. Appl buy Netflix could shift develop by other platform away from iOS.2. Netflix may not move the needl at AppleAppl ha a ton of dough on it books. There is more than $246 billion in cash and market secur on it balanc sheet, and between a presid that may relax repatri rule and a tech behemoth hungri for growth it may onli be a matter of time befor Appl goe on a shop spree.A purchas of Appl may seem to help with growth on the surface. Apple' revenu declin 7.7% in fiscal 2016, unlik Netflix which saw it top line soar by 30.2% last year. However, Netflix go from $6.8 billion to $8.8 billion last year would onli be a drop in the bucket at Appl which went from $233.7 billion to $215.6 billion. The combin compani would have seen it revenu declin 6.7% to $224.4 billion.An argument could be made that Appl could use Netflix as a tool to drive hardwar sale by make the servic or some part of the platform exclus to iO and MacOS, but that would also like shave the total revenu at Netflix.3. It' go to take a fat premium to nab NetflixTher are a coupl of tech, cable, and media compani that could take advantag of Netflix' competit position, and the purchas would be dilut in all cases. However, it would probabl be a lot more dilut to the buyer than it appear at current market prices.There' no reason for Netflix to settl for a modest buyout premium. Thi is a stock that wa the S&P 500' biggest gainer in 2013 and 2015, more than doubl each year. It' up anoth 15% less than a sixth of the way through 2017. How much would you accept to punch out?Netflix is a great compani in a great place, but it' also a hot stock -- and that' not the kind of situat where sharehold will go along with a 20% to 30% premium. Appl is one of the few compani with that kind of dough in it arsenal, but you just know that Netflix will not come cheap. With a like drawn-out regulatori approv process if a deal were to be announced, Netflix would be right to command a lot of money to be wait in the wing while it stock ha been one of the hottest stock over the past four years. Appl and Netflix make sense, but it' just not go to happen.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Two top Wall Street analyst have lent their voic to the bullish sentiments.Thi articl seek to explor where equiti are actual head amidst the din of unend stream of analysi from differ comment on the wisdom/foolish of chase the rally.Whi are Investor Worri About Equities?If we were to go by the voic of 'reason' U.S. stock should have been struggl to stay afloat sinc Donald Trump won a surpris victori dure the 2016 election.

Is Apple Stock a Buy Ahead of iPhone 8?,2/21/2017,"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) upcom iPhon 8 is look as if it could repres a total overhaul to the current iPhon design. Recent rumor suggest that the upcom flagship version of the iPhon could have an edge-to-edg OLE 5.8-inch display, integr of Touch ID into the display, the elimin the home button, 3D facial-recognit capabilities, wireless charging, and a cost upward of $1,000. A major overhaul like thi could easili solicit a monster upgrad cycle, akin to huge growth in iPhon sale spark by the iPhon 6 and 6 Plu launch sever year ago.With such a signific updat possibl around the corner, is now a good time to buyAppl stock? Or should investor stay on the sidelin until specul is replac by facts?Imag source: ApplemakeArticleAd();I'd argu that Appl stock is a buy ahead of the iPhon 8 launch. But it' not necessarili becaus the iPhon 8 might repres the first signific redesign to the iPhon in three years. It' becaus Apple' underli iPhon busi alreadi ha some concret trend work in it favor, whether the next iPhon get a radic revamp or not.Even with an outdat form factor, the iPhon is growingApple' 2016 flagship iPhon launch broke from the company' usual practic of redesign the smartphone' form factor everi other year. The iPhon 7 and 7 Plu sport the same gener design as 2015' iPhon 6s and 6s Plu and even 2014' iPhon 6 and 6 Plus. Nevertheless, iPhon sale hit a record high in the company' most recent quarter. In Apple' first fiscal quarter of 2017, iPhon revenu and unit were up 5% year over year.Thi bode well for the strength of Apple' iPhon business. If Appl can continu grow iPhon unit and revenu in it import holiday quarter with a three-year-old form factor, Apple' iPhon busi may be better off than investor realize.Apple' price power is as strong as everA testament to Apple' clout with it custom base, custom are pay more for iPhon than ever before. Appl ha continu offer higher-pr option for custom by roll out Plu version of it flagship devic with the iPhon 6 and 6 Plus, offer higher storag tiers, and simpli byincreas the price of it iPhones. And custom don't seem to mind. In Apple' most recent quarter, the iPhone' averag sell price hit an all-tim high of $695, up from $691 in the year-ago quarter, and up significantli from $637 three year ago.Thi incred price power vouch for the premium price Appl custom remain will to pay for an iPhone.iPhon owner are extrem satisfiedAppl ha alway put custom satisfact at the top of it priorities. And it continu to pay off for the company. Cite the latest data from 451 Research, Appl CFO Luca Maestri note in the company' most recent earn call that iPhon owner had a 97% overal satisfact rate in the U.S., with 99% satisfact for owner of the iPhon 7 Plus.With satisfact like this, it' unlik that iPhon buyer will be switch to anoth brand.Imag source: AppleMor consum are upgrad and switch to iPhon than everCustom appear as will as ever to buy an iPhone. Apple' absolut number of iPhon upgrad and the number of buyer switch from anoth smartphon were both at an all-tim high in the company' most recent quarter, CEO Tim Cook said in Apple' first-quart earn call.Put all of thi against the back drop of Apple' conserv price-to-earn ratio of just 16.4 and a healthi iPhon segment alon look like a reason to bet on Appl stock.

Why Investors Should Be Optimistic About Apple's China Rebound,2/21/2017,"Last year wa rough onApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) busi in China for a few reasons. The ongo strength in the U.S. dollar continu to weigh on results, which also affect Apple' perform in Hong Kong (which is includ in Apple' Greater China segment), sinc the Hong Kong dollar ha been peg to the U.S. dollar for over three decades. In term of investor sentiment, 2015 wa so strong that Appl face tough comparison throughout 2016.But the Mac maker is mount a rebound in the Middl Kingdom. On the last call, CFO Luca Maestri note that mainland China revenu wa ""even with the all-tim record result from a year ago, and grew in constant currenc terms."" Local rival Oppo and Vivo, which are both own by BBK Electronics, enjoy aprecipit riselast year as Appl fell to the No. 5 spot in China. Despit intens competit from low-cost rivals, investor have reason to be optimist about Apple' rebound.Word on the StreetMorgan Stanley analyst Kati Huberti put out a research note (viaTech Trader Daily) earlier today, in which she believ that Appl will be abl to win over switcher from Oppo and Vivo. Huberti estim that 20% of smartphon user that are current use Chines brand will switch to the iPhon the next time they upgrade. With expect run high for thi year' 10th-gener iPhone, combin with Chines consumers' sensit to form factor changes, Appl could enjoy extrem high upgrad and switcher rates.makeArticleAd();iPhon 7 Plus. Imag source: Apple.Huberty' survey show that 24% of current Oppo user and 28% of current Vivo user are alreadi plan on switch to the iPhone. Includ survey that cover other local brand and an assumpt of a two-year upgrad cycle, she believ that upward of 127 million non-Appl smartphon user in China will be look to upgrad or switch for thi iPhon cycle. Meanwhile, Appl enjoy much higher loyalti among it user -- 74% of survey custom are stick with Appl -- a commonli cite competit advantage.Brand loyalti is hard to come by in ChinaWhil Apple' high custom retent rate aren't news, they are more impress when you consid the context. Chines consum have histor been notori for extrem low brand loyalti rates, although thi ha start to improv more recently.For instance, McKinsey note in 2010 that while Chines consum are brand conscious, that doesn't realli translat into loyalty. Kantar observ someth similar in 2012. In the year since, there ha been a grow subset of consum that are ""becom loyal to singl brands,"" McKinsey said in 2016. Here' McKinsey princip Fang Gong in April of last year:A coupl year ago, when we talk to our client in the consum and retail industries, we heard a lot of complaint about the low loyalti level of Chines consumers. Today, base on the reports, we cannot say that it' complet changed, but we can say that the loyalti level of Chines consum ha been improving. Probabl not to a singl brand, but to a short list of brand that are in the consumer' consider set -- and not onli in their daili consumpt category, such as food or apparel, but also in big items, such as automotive.Thi is most preval for premium brands, and Appl certainli qualifi as a premium brand. Throughout most of the develop world, Appl enjoy thi same dynamic: captur consum from rival brand and retain them much better, result in a slow but steadi increas in it instal base. The fact that Appl can do thi in a region known for low brand loyalti is particularli impressive, and goe to show that despit neg storylines, Apple' busi in China still ha room to run.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Best Stocks for Your Roth IRA,2/20/2017,"They say that there are onli two certainti in life: death and taxes. While you can't cheat death and better not cheat on your taxes, you can at least avoid pay Uncl Sam tax on ani gain earn from invest held in a Roth IRA. That' whi we think that the best stock to own in a Roth are one that will like have gener substanti gain by the time you retire.Thre that we think fit that bill areApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Paycom Software(NYSE: PAYC) , andMed Properti Trust(NYSE: MPW) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Reduc HR headach and gener profitsDaniel Miller(Paycom Solutions):Roth IRA have becom wildli popular in recent years, and it' pretti easi to understand why. The big sell point for a Roth IRA is that money contribut can grow complet tax-fre for life. That mean investor should focu on compani that can grow and compound over decades; when you withdraw the money in retirement, you won't pay a dime on those earnings.For that reason, if you have decad as your invest horizon, you should lean toward slightli more riski invest that could end up be big winner by retir -- think small- and mid-cap stocks. One that' high on my list is Paycom Solutions.Paycom Solut is a lead provid of innovative, cloud-based, human capit manag softwar that help compani lower labor cost and drive employe engagement. The stock' been on fire, driven by both it top- and bottom-lin gains:PAYCdata byYCharts.Here' whi you should like the stock long-term for a Roth IRA. First, the compani ha a strong competit advantag sinc onc HR depart use Paycom, it becom time-consuming, difficult, and expens to switch away from use it softwar products. That' driven it retent rate to a stagger 91%.Anoth reason to buy into the stock is that CEO Chad Richison own roughli 13% of share outstanding, align hi interest directli with individu investors. Paycom also boast a strong balanc sheet due to the software-as-a-servic (SaaS) busi model be cloud-bas and thu capital-light. These factor make Paycom look intrigu to hold in a Roth IRA over the come decades.Sit back and collect a healthi incom streamMatt DiLallo(Med Properti Trust):On of the mani benefit of a Roth IRA is that investor never pay tax on the gains, which includ both capit gain and dividend income. The tax save on dividend incom can be substantial, especi for high-yield invest like real estat invest trusts. It' whi REIT make great invest for a Roth IRA.On of my favorit REIT is Medic Properti Trust. The compani current own 247 hospit across the U.S. and Europ that it leas to hospit operators. These compani run the hospit and pay Medic Properti rent each month, which it return to investor in the form of a veri healthi 7.2% dividend yield.Whil a yield that high is sometim an omin sign, that is not the case at Medic Properti Trust. The compani spent much of the past year strengthen it balanc sheet, and as a result, it ha one of the lowest leverag ratio among healthcar REITs. It also pay out less than 80% of it cash flow via dividends, which provid a littl extra cushion as well as some seed money to fund addit acquisitions.Speak of acquisitions, they are Medic Properties' primari growth driver. The compani ha grown it size at a 30% compound annual rate over the past five year by acquir addit hospit properties, enabl it to increas the dividend by 15% sinc the start of 2014. With a larg untap market in front of it, the compani anticip that it can invest between $500 million to $1 billion per year to acquir new properties, which should provid healthi dividend growth for year to come.Focus on thi company' solid dividendBrian Stoffel(Apple):I think put soliddividend stocksin your Roth IRA make a lot of sense. That' becaus price appreci via quarterli payment is a pretti sure bet. And unlik a tradit IRA, you'll never have to pay tax on ani of that appreciation. I like to save my higher-risk, higher-reward invest for my tradit IRA.That' whi I would suggest invest your Roth money in Apple, which I'm bet will increas it dividend payment over the years.Whil I'll admit that the company' moat is constrict by the fact that it need to continu come up with the Next Big Thing, thi is a dividend stock that shouldn't be ignored. Current yield 1.8%, Appl onli use 23% of it $54 billion in free cash flow over the past year. Not onli that, but the compani also ha almost a quartertrillionin cash, in long and short-term investments.Whil the day of headi growth may have passed, that cash will like be return to shareholders. There are lot of differ way thi could happen. One could be a simpl realiz on the part of manag that the compani ha tap out most of it invest growth avenues. Already, thi move is underway under CEO Tim Cook, as it previous didn't offer a dividend. The other is under even more aggress share repurchases, which the compani is alreadi do -- but could continu indefinitely. Furthermore, under the Trump administration, the compani could be allow to make a one-tim transfer of oversea cash without a big tax impact and that would creat a rather larg one-tim boon that could be paid out to shareholders.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Guru Loves Valeant; Should You?,2/20/2017,"Hedg funds' final 13F form for 2016 were publish last week, and as usual, the data ha been scrutin by the financi media. There were a few surpris in the figures, includingWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)' new favorit position,Apple(AAPL), and the gener rotat away from tech toward financials.On posit chang that stand out, however, is not Buffett' move but that ofFranc Chou(Trades, Portfolio). Chou' Chou Associ is a tradit valu fund, and Chou is well known in the valu commun for hi invest style.Sinc inception, the Chou Associ Fund ha achiev an averag annual return for investor of around 12% by follow Chou' valu style. Befor purchas distress securities, he ask the follow questions:makeArticleAd();What would be left if the compani wa forc to liquidate?How compet is the management?I the underli busi strong enough to gener consist cash flow?Do the compani have a strong enough balanc sheet to make it worth the risk?He' look for a compani with strong manag that' fallen out of favor with the market, that' cheap and not go to go out of busi anytim soon. With these invest criteria in mind, some might wonder whi Chou Associ increas it posit in struggl pharmaceut compani Valeant dure the fourth quarter.What' with Valeant?Ch ha not been aValeant(VRX) support for long when compar to the like of Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio). The fund first start buy the compani in the first quarter of 2016 after the stock had more than halv in price from it $250 per share high. Chou continu to buy in the second quarter, ad 470,000 share to hi exist basket of 980,000 share acquir dure the first three month of the year. For the final quarter of 2016, Chou increas hi posit further by 36% or 514,000 shares. Overall, the stock now account for 9.4% of Chou' overal portfolio, the third-largest posit afterJPMorgan(JPM) andBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A).Th big question is, what should investor make of thi buy by Chou? Doe hi buy signal there' valu on offer at Valent?Valu on offer?Interestingly, Chou is one of the onli fund manag to own Valent. Jeff Ubben' ValueAct Capit and Ackman are the onli other manag to own substanti posit in the firm. Thi either mean Chou see someth most don't, or he' lost it, which is what most peopl tend to think when a manag take a nonconsensu position.Even though Chou is the onli hedg fund manag buy the stock, Valent isn't as unlov as most believe. In a substanti vote of confid for the company, manag is also becom one of the company' largest investors. Last year, while Chou wa ad to hi posit manag acquir over $5 million of stock for itself, a strong signal that it believ the compani can return to health.But even if manag is optimist about Valent' outlook, the one thing that' certain about the compani is that it financi are a car crash and an accid wait to happen. Even though the current manag team ha manag to lock in $2.1 billion of acquisitions, debt remain high at $30 billion. Anoth $8 billion of acquisit is current in the cards. The compani is depend upon the kind of capit market to keep the light on. If creditor get spooked, there' no chanc the group will be abl to meet it obligations, and that' a big red flag for valu investors.Still, the compani is not a total basket case.

3 Companies That Need to Kick Their CEO to the Curb,2/19/2017,"Sometimes, chang need to be made to the top becaus of deep-root organiz problems. Other times, someon els is necessari to take a compani to the next level. Our Motley Fool contributor think it may be time for chang in manag atFitbit(NYSE: FIT) ,Depomed(NASDAQ: DEPO) , andTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) . Read on to see whi they think these compani might do better under someon else.Say it isn't soTim Brugger(Fitbit): When co-found and CEO Jame Park announc preliminari fourth quarter and 2016 annual result on Jan. 30 there wa littl to like. Fitbit' poor revenu result are expect to be well below analyst estimates, and Fitbit will shave overhead primarili through job cut impact ""approxim 110 people,"" equal to 6% of it workforce. And the worst wa yet to come.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Despit tepid revenu growth, Fitbit' gross margin will be ""materi below it previous issu 46% forecast"" due to excess inventory. Fitbit sale are on an uptick, but not close to expectations. But the news that warrant Park be on the wrong end of a kick -- if not to the curb, then aw close -- is Fitbit' plan to enter the smartwatch wars.Th move to join the like ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and it Watch wasn't surpris given Fitbit' recent acquisit of Pebbl and Vector Watch softwar assets, but Park' decis is still wrong. Appl know first-hand the smartwatch boom mani had expect hasn't materialized.Accord to IDC 2016' third calendar quarter wa dismal for smartwatch sales, declin 52%. The Appl Watch no longer ha the appeal of be new which result in a 72% nosed to 1.1 million units. And Fitbit want to join the sink smartwatch ship?If watch actual becom ""smart"" rather than expens fit tracker the market may change. But if it does, how mani consum will opt for Fitbit over Appl orSamsung? And Fitbit will spend massiv resourc to develop it device, abov the acquisit alreadi squandered. Park is lead Fitbit into a battl that' alreadi lost.Investor could lobbi for chang at the topTodd Campbell(Depomed): Activist investor Starboard Valu L.P. took a nearli 10% stake in drugmak Depom last year to lobbi for a sale, but so far, littl ha happen to encourag investor that will happen, and as a result, Depomed' share have sunk 46% sinc Juli 2015.Initially, Depomed' board of director clash with Starboard Value' Jeff Smith. However, the board agre last fall to allow Smith to pick three peopl to join Depomed' board of directors. Also, becaus Smith had been critic of management' reject of a $33 per share offer fromHorizon Pharma(NASDAQ: HZNP) in mid-2015, the board agre to entertain bid from suitors.Unfortunately, Depomed' full-throttl reject of Horizon Pharma' prior bid appear to have sour Horizon Pharma on make anoth offer. Rumor of interest from Purdu Pharma, the maker of the top sell Oxycontin, appear off-the-mark, and report interest from invest firm KKR hasn't led to a deal either.Abs a buyer, I think pressur will mount on Depom CEO Jim Schoeneck to prove to investor that hi cours is the right one. Previously, rapid sale growth for Depomed' opioid pain medicine, Nucynta, help Schoeneck make hi case, but opioid prescript have slump on rise concern over abuse, and that' slow Nucynta' momentum.Whil Depom hasn't report it fourth-quart figur yet, anem result in Q3, includ 5% year-over-year top-lin growth, prompt Schoeneck to kick-off the company' third quarter earn confer call admit that quarterli result ""fell well short of our expectations.""Given Depomed' share are trade at about half the price that Horizon Pharma wa onc will to pay, and sale growth is slowing, it wouldn't shock me if Starboard' next move is to lobbi for replac Schoeneck. Whether someon els would do better is anyone' guess, but bruis investor are eager for some posit news out of thi company, and that could mean that chang is coming.Hey hey, ho ho, Jack Dorsey ha got to go!Rich Smith(Twitter): Jack Dorsey, ladi and gentleman! Let' give him a hand -- and then show him the door!Jack Dorsey co-found internet icon Twitter in 2006. For this, he deserv to be congratulated, as Twitter ha ultim grown into perhap the most import tool for monitor break news on the internet. Where Dorsey ha failed, however, is in take thi lead internet platform -- one so use that the Presid of the Unit State ha adopt it as hi go-to medium for commun with the public -- and find a way to earn a profit from it.I mean, think about thi for a second: Twitter ha more than 300millionmonthli users. Donald Trump made Twitter an integr part of hi win presidenti campaign and continu to tweet from the Oval Office. These days, you can't open up a newspap without see a headlin about some bit of break news from the White Hous that first appear on Twitter. And yet, in the same quarter in which Donald Trump wa elect President, Twitter experienc liter zero user growth, achiev onli singl digit revenu growth -- and made no profit whatsoever.Apolog for speak so bluntli here, but while Dorsey ha the right tool in hand, he clearli doesn't know how to use it. Hand thi guy a hammer, and he'd tri to open a can of bean with it -- and fail.WithTwitt stocknow down 73% from it high of 2013, and down 40% from when Dorsey re-took over the busi as CEO in Octob 2015, enough is enough.

Touch ID would debut the follow year in 2013' iPhon 5S, and subsequ made it way throughout the iPhon portfolio. While it would be a shame to shutter Touch ID, Appl ha sold 690 million total iPhon and gener nearli $450 billion in iPhon revenu sinc the iPhon 5S launch, so it certainli got it money worth from the acquisit sinc Touch ID ha been a key featur that contribut to sale growth ever since.2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar were the first Mac to get Touch ID.

Is the iPad Dead?,2/19/2017,"Less than four year ago, it seem plausibl thatApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPad product line wa on track todomin the tablet marketand upend the global PC market.Today, that idea look laughable. iPad sale have been in free fall for years. Potenti catalyst like the launch of the business-friendli iPad Pro lineup, the avail of cheaper iPads, and the age of the iPad instal base have all fail to reinvigor sales.With thi backdrop, it' reason to wonder if the iPad' immens popular wa just a fad. There' still a chanc for the iPad to make a modest comeback, though -- and if that' go to happen, it will almost certainli begin within the next year.makeArticleAd();Th launch of the iPad Pro hasn't boost iPad sales. Imag source: Apple.iPad sale continu to declineAppl post it first full-year iPad sale dip in fiscal 2014. Unit sale slip 4% that year, while revenu fell 5%.The sale declin acceler thereafter. In fiscal 2015, unit sale plung 19% and revenu drop by 23%. In fiscal 2016, unit sale fell anoth 17%, while revenu tumbl 11%. Double-digit declin along both metric continu in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.The net result is that Appl ship just 42.6 million iPad dure the 2016 calendar year, down about 40% from the peak a few year ago. In it most recent annual report, it blame the declin in iPad sale on cannib by other product (most notabl phablet like the iPhon 6 Plu and it successors) and a long replac cycl for iPads. The strong dollar may have also hurt sale outsid the U.S.Do the iPad have a future?Despit the weak sale trend, CEO Tim Cook reiter on the company' recent earn call that he is bullish about the iPad' long-term trajectory. Sale grew at a double-digit rate in India and Mainland China last quarter. The iPad continu to gain traction in the corpor sector. Moreover, custom satisfact remain extrem high.Thus, the big problem is that peopl who bought iPad sever year ago don't seem to be replac their devices. The first four full-siz iPad gener and the origin iPad Mini -- all of which debut between 2010 and 2012 -- still account formor than 45% of iPad usage, accord to Fiksu.It' becom less and less plausibl that a big iPad replac cycl is right around the corner. The iPad' heyday wa from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2014. Dure that period, Appl sold an averag of 65.8 million iPad per year, bring in over $30 billion of revenu annually. Those devic are now three to five year old. Even if iPad are destin to have a PC-like upgrad cycl of four or five years, Appl should alreadi be benefit from a wave of upgrades.Still, the high price tag of the iPad Pro and the lack of updat to cheaper iPad (the iPad Air 2 wa launch in 2014 and the iPad Mini 4 debut in 2015) haven't helped. It' possibl that an upgrad of the full iPad product lineup could get sale grow again.Old iPad model have proven to be good enough for most consumers. Imag source: Apple.New iPad on the wayIf that' the case, then help may be on the way. Mani Appl watcher expect the compani to roll out an updat iPad lineup thi spring, perhap as soon as next month.Ther isn't a consensu as to how mani new iPad will be unveil or what size they will be. Highli follow analyst Ming-Chi Kuo ha predict thatthre new iPads-- successor to both version of the iPad Pro as well as a cheaper 9.7"" replac for the iPad Air 2 -- will be released. Other pundit expect Appl to releas a new iPad Mini (either call the iPad Mini 5 or the iPad Pro Mini).Given how easi the year-over-year comparison are these days, the simultan releas of three or more new model ought to get iPad sale grow again. Still, investor need to curb their enthusiasm. The current version of the iPad Pro haven't sold all that well. The older iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini lineup have been far more popular over the past year, indic that most consum aren't will to pay $600 or more for an iPad anymore.Of course, the most ardent iPad fan will still shell out big buck for the latest and greatest models. Appl may also drop the price of the first-gener iPad Pro and the iPad Mini 4. That could lure more price-sensit custom to upgrad their age iPads. But the iPad product line may never return to it previou peak in term of sale and profitability.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Activ merchant accept Amazon Payment grew 120% year over year. More than 50% of the custom who use the platform were also Amazon Prime members.How doe Amazon Payment compare?Amazon Payment is the latest payment platform that allow custom to pay for onlin purchas from a number of differ websit use one account. It joinsPayP Hold Inc(NASDAQ: PYPL) andAppl Inc's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Appl Pay as other popular digit wallet with a built-in custom base.In Apple' 2017 fiscal first-quart confer call, CEO Tim Cook had some veri posit thing to say about Appl Pay. Among other things, Cook said that dure the past year the number of Appl Pay user had tripl and transact volum for the quarter wa up 500% year over year.Imag source: Visa Inc.Whil it' hard to make an apples-to-appl comparison (pardon the pun), PayPal is the unquest leader in thi space. In it most recent report quarter, PayPal had 197 million activ accounts, each averag a shade more than 31 transact per month. The company' total payment volum wa report at more than $99 billion, a 25% increas year over year.Th reason whi these number don't easili compar is becaus Appl and Amazon are still in the nascent stage of their effort and, as such, are work from much smaller bases. PayPal' activ account repres custom who are make regular purchas or transactions. In Amazon' press release, the trumpet 33 million custom were just custom who had use the platformonce, a far differ metric than custom who are regularli engag with the platform.Onlin merchant coverag -- the avail of a company' payment process servic -- is anoth arena where PayPal hold a big lead.

That doesn't mean these two compani might not overtak PayPal as the domin digit wallet one day, just that it is far too earli to make such a prediction.PayP is still the top dog -- for nowPayP still emerg as the top digit wallet among consumers. It base of almost 200 million activ account and impress onlin merchant coverag will be a tough moat to overcome, even by rival with such deep pocket as Amazon and Apple. Furthermore, PayPal show no sign of slow growth. The company' number of activ accounts, payment transactions, and total payment volum were all up by double-digit percentag in it most recent report quarter.Nor is PayPal rest on it laurels. Innov and popular new product like One Touch arepow mobil growthand it continu to increas market share in thegrow e-commerc movement.But none of that should take away what Amazon Payment and Appl Pay have the potenti to accomplish in thi space. Appl Pay ha legion of loyal iPhon users. Last quarter alone, Appl sold more than 78 million iPhones.Amazon ha a loyal base of about 63 million Amazon Prime members. Thi give it a lot of room for growth with custom who alreadi use their Amazon.com account for onlin purchases. Amazon' biggest challeng might be convinc more merchant to give them access to what their custom are buying. With all the data Amazon alreadi ha on digit spend trends, compet merchant might be reluct to give up more data to the onlin retail giant.At the end of the day, it is hard to recommend buy Amazon or Appl sole on their effort in payments.

Could This Oil Stock Really Become the Next Apple?,2/19/2017,"Pioneer Natur Resources(NYSE: PXD) ha long believ that it' sit on one of -- if notthe-- biggest oil field in the world. In fact, so much low-cost oil satur the rock beneath the land it control in thePermian Basinof western Texa that the compani recent unveil a bold decade-long plan to develop thi resource. What' remark about that plan is that the product from new well will fuel more than 20% annual cash flow growth over the next 10 year even ifoil pricesdon't budge.That' elite-level cash flow growth that, accord to an analysi byJPMorgan, onli 15 compani have eclips over the past decade. Among those cash flow growth king were tech giantsApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Amazon, andAlphabet. Given the histor perform of those tech giant and the other on the list, Pioneer' ambiti growth plan could fuel it stock to deliv market-thrash return in the year ahead.Sand Weems. Imag source: Pioneer Natur Resources.makeArticleAd();Alreadi a step aheadPion Natur Resourc is one of the few oil compani that ha consist grown product dure the oil market' recent downturn. The compani ha increas output everi quarter sinc oil price collaps in 2014, with last year' product up 15% versu 2015. Contrast thi with similarli size rival like Bakken Shale-focusedContinent Resources(NYSE: CLR) or diversifi shale drillerEncana(NYSE: ECA) . In Continent Resources' case, it product wa down 4.3% year over year in 2016 while Encana' output slump double-digit due in part to asset sales.Th reason Pioneer could continu grow wa due to it cash-rich balanc sheet and the fact it earn higher return on new well thank to the uniqu properti of the Permian. Currently, Pioneer Natur Resources' intern rate of return on new well in the Basin will rang from 50% to 100% assum $55 oil and $3 natur ga thi year. Contrast thi with Encana, which earn a minimum 35% return from it best well at those price or Continental' 40% return for Bakken well at $55 oil. Those higher return enabl Pioneer to gener more cash flow, which it can reinvest to grow faster than it rivals.Dril down into the planA those return suggest, Pioneer Natur Resourc control some prime drillabl land. Thank to a seri of smart acquisit and organ leasing, the compani current hold a 785,000-acr posit that it built up over the past two decades. The compani believ that there are as much as 11 billion barrel of oil equival resourc underneath that land, which it can extract through an estim 20,000 futur drill locations.At current oil prices, the compani anticip that it can gener suffici cash flow to drill enough new well each year to boost it product by 15% annual over the next decade. That would grow the company' output from an averag of 234,000 barrel of oil equival per day last year (BOE/D) up to an even 1 million BOE/D by the end of 2026. Moreover, due to the high-margin natur of these wells, it would grow Pioneer Natur Resources' cash flow by a more than 20% compound annual rate over that same time frame assum no further improv in crude prices.Imag source: Getti Images.Put thing into perspectiveThos metric would put the compani in an elit category. For example, if it achiev it cash flow grow target, it would gener more than $10 billion in oper cash flow in 2026, up from $1.5 billion last year. Just to put that into perspective, big oil giantConocoPhillips(NYSE: COP) gener roughli $4.4 billion in cash flow from oper activ last year on more than 1.5 million BOE/D of production. Though, to be fair, ConocoPhillips' realiz price per BOE wa $28.35 last year, so it cash flow would have been higher use Pioneer' commod price assumptions.However, it' the sheer rate of Pioneer' growth that is so remarkable, not just for an oil producer, but when taken in the context of the broader market. As previous mentioned, JPMorgan found that just 15 stock in the entir Russel 1000 Index have grown cash flow by more than 20% annual over a 10-year period, with the bulk of that elit group made up of tech giant such as Apple. Needless to say, that steadili grow cash flow ha done wonder for their stock prices:AAPLdata byYCharts.In fact, accord to the bank' research, these 15 stock have deliv an averag total sharehold return of 662% over that timeframe, or an averag yearli return of nearli 19%. That' not to say Pioneer will match those returns, but it' 10-year growth forecast certainli give it the fuel to deliv market-b return as long as oil price don't collaps again. Meanwhile, if price rise abov Pioneer' outlook, it would like grow cash flow by an even healthier clip.Bottom line, Pioneer Natur Resources' forecast make it a stock that growth investor should serious consider.10 stock we like better than Pioneer Natur ResourcesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Overdue for a Pullback, But Upside Remains Great",2/17/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a stock I'v been bullish on for a long time, and my outlook hasn't chang in either the short or long term. AAPL stock ha been incred strong recent (a ha the overal market) and a healthi pullback in the next week or two is certainli a possibility.makeArticleAd();Appl stock gain 10% through all of 2016, and in just the seven week so far in 2017 it is alreadi up nearli 17%. In addition, the rel strength index (RSI, locat at the bottom of the chart below) is up to 93, which is the highest it' been in a year. Of course, a stock can continu to ralli even with an elev RSI, but there' no question the odd of a pullback are becom higher.Appl ha initi support at the old all-tim high of $134.54, but given AAPL stock' recent climb, it' more realist to expect a slightli larger dip. That would put the next level of support at the upper end of the larg gap AAPL left after earn in earli February. If it get anywher close to that $127 area, which would repres a healthi 6% pullback from current prices, it would be consid a great buy opportunity.Bottom Line on Appl StockFrom a fundament perspective, Appl remain the largest compani in the world, but it is also veri undervalu right now. AAPL stock current trade with a forward P/E of approxim 15, which is below the 17.5 P/E the S&P 500 garner today.3 Cheap Lithium Stock to Buy That Will Energ Your PortfolioAlso, keep in mind that the compani should grow earn at least as quickli as the index. Ad in Apple' intang and the cult-lik follow it continu to have around the world, there' no question it should have a valuat abov that of the market. If AAPL stock were to trade at the S&P' valuat of 17.5x 2017 EP estimates, share price would be up around $156.27.Look ahead, I believ Appl will report much better 2017 earn than Wall Street expects, and I think $175 is a more reason price target over the next 12 months. That' a long way up from the price of Appl stock today, so I'd be look to build a posit on a healthi pullback.Matthew McCall is founder and presid of Penn Financi Group, an invest advisori firm.

Appl face slow iPhon demand in most of the regions, either becaus of competit or regulatori hurdl (China) or market satur (the U.S). Therefore, it make sens for the compani to solidifi it posit in India, which is project to becom the second largest smartphon market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Appl sale in India grew approxim 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) popul and increas invest in broadband network by the govern also make India an attract growth opportun for Appl over the long run. In fact, the govern under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capit and boost manufactur facil in India.Th recent outlin FDI polici also bode well for the compani as it elimin the requir to local sourc product for at least a three-year period. Thi will enabl Appl to open it solely-own retail store in India. Thereafter, the compani will have to compli with the rule.

Thi should lower prices.Plus, Apple' rival Samsung along with a few Chines smartphon maker domin thi market. Samsung ha long been in the market and with reportedli 23% share, it is a lead player in the country. Appl is quit late to the party.Also, Apple' lack of focu on region customers' demand is a concern. India is categor by handset that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Appl is not keen on make dual SIM handsets. Thi could be a veri big impedi to growth in the country.Also, analyst observ that Appl is ""relocating"" manufactur to India from China, given rise labor costs. Howev anoth analyst argu that though labor is cheap compar with China, product is rel better in China. Simpl assembl may not drastic bring down prices.

You'll Never Guess Where People Use Apple Pay the Most,2/16/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail store in the U.S., accept it Appl Pay mobil payment option. Although there are some notabl except among the largest retailers, such asWal-MartandTarget, who don't offer it, other likeGapdo, or soon will featur the payment solution.Becaus it' avail on mobil phones, tablets, and even the Appl Watch, it ubiqu and rel eas of use make it the go-to choic for consum on the go as well as those dissatisfi with the hassl and delay of embed chip cards. Accord to data analyt firm TXN Solutions, which survey the transact from over 3 million payment cards, Appl Pay usag ha soar by 50% over the past year.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Th rise of Appl PayIndeed, dure Apple' first-quart earn confer call with analyst last month, CEO Tim Cook said transact volum had risen sixfold from the prior year as Appl Pay expand into four new countries, includ Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain.Whil that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN' more mute (though still significant) rise, it come down to a differ in what' be measured. While Appl isn't particularli forthcom on detail of the Appl Pay ecosystem, it is talk about the actual number of transact made, while the data analyt firm is referenc the percentag of transact from it panel of consum who provid their credit and debit card data and whose bank distinguish Appl Pay transactions.Whil that natur limit the univers of transact captured, over time it still track the accept of the mobil payment option and it growth, and what it found wa that most peopl were use it in mobil app and on websites.A place to crash for the nightThat surpris conclus wa reach after find that of all the place Appl Pay user were use the payment option, get a cheap hotel room at the last minut top the list. Order takeout wa appar the second favorit way to use the service.Imag source: HotelTonight.Th TXN data, which examin payment made between Decemb 2015 and Decemb 2016, found mobil travel app HotelTonight, a last-minut reserv service, had 3.4% of all it credit card transact made with Appl Pay, follow by food deliveri servic Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usag rate or slightli higher.What is more notabl about the survey result is that despit the broad prolifer of place accept Appl Pay as an option, it realli hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most place saw it repres less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creat much of a stir in the payment industry, as it repres just a small percentag of total credit card transactions.But let' first cross off the name of store where peoplearen'tus Appl Pay.Starbucks' mobil order trump Appl payAt the bottom of the list isStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) , which came in last on a list of the 13 top place process Appl Pay transactions, account for about 0.5% of the coffe shop' total credit card transactions. Consid Starbuck ha it own highli regard mobil order and payment option, which is often look at as the gold standard for conveni and eas of use, it rais eyebrow that peopl are use Appl Pay there at all.On it first-quart earn confer call with analyst two week ago, Starbuck Presid Kevin Johnson said, ""Mobil Order & Pay had a banner quarter, repres more than 7% of total transactions, doubl the figur from Q1 last year, and we now have nearli 1,200 store with 20% or more Mobil Order & Pay transact at peak, compar to onli 13 store one year ago."" When you have custom loyalti like that, who need Appl Pay?Imag source: Starbucks.Food retail still repres the lion' share of place see Appl Pay usage, and Low Foods,Sprout Farmer Markets,Panera Bread, and Schnuck round out the bottom five place for user of the mobil wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transact account for use the payment method.A prescript for futur growth?So, if Starbuck and trendi groceri store were bring up the rear, who wa it that wa lead the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believ Duan Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstor chain own byWalgreen Boot Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) ?Accord to the TXN data, the pharmaci oper wa the top spot where peopl use Appl Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transact identifi the mobil payment option be chosen. That put it slightli ahead of No. 2 retailerWhol Food Market(Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of it credit card transact use Appl Pay.Becaus both retail have been with the servic sinc Appl launch Appl Pay in 2014, it might not be so surpris they were well ahead of the others, includ Canteen Vend at No. 3 with slightli less than 1% of it transactions, and fourth place Peet' Coffe with just under 0.8%.Whether that mean Appl Pay will ever supplant EMV card as a prefer payment option remain to be seen, but it seem hard to believ it will replac Starbucks' mobil order and pay app anytim soon. And though Appl Pay user seem to be a rare breed indeed, mayb all you need to see them in action is to simpli stop by your local pharmacy.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying Now,2/16/2017,"Warren Buffett is arguabl the best investor on the planet, and hi penchant for pick winner for long-haul portfolio make it worth pay attent to the stock he' buy for hisBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) . Fortunately, big investor like Buffett are requir to file a 13F report with the SEC everi quarter that show what they'v been up to.In Buffett' case, he' been busi buyingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) , andMonsanto(NYSE: MON) . Should you buy these stock too?A big win that' get biggerBack in 2012, Warren Buffett told investor that Steve Job call him a few year prior with question on how best to spend Apple' cash war chest. Buffett told Job to buyback Apple' stock, but Job didn't.makeArticleAd();IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.It took a while, and a sell-off, but Warren Buffett ha final follow hi own advic and taken a big (and growing) stake in Appl for Berkshir Hathaway.Appl share show up in Berkshir Hathaway' portfolio last year, and at the time, Buffett said the share had been bought by one of hi lieutenants. Mayb so, but Berkshire' posit in Appl ha grown steadili sinc then, and now it' Berkshir Hathaway' sixth largest holding, by value.So far, buy Appl share ha proven savvy. In the wake of worri over slow iPhon sales, share hit a low of $90 last May. Today, they'r at $135.It' anyone' guess how long Appl will remain in Berkshir Hathaway' portfolio, or if Berkshir Hathaway will buy more share thi year, but there are reason whi investor might want to look for a chanc to pick up share in the company, too. Appl iPhon sale bounc back to growth last quarter, and management' plan to doubl servic sale by 2020 could provid a lot of margin-friendli support to Apple' bottom line.Investor may also benefit from ani tax reform that allow the compani to repatri some of the $200 million-plu in cash it hold overseas. And investor should probabl expect that Apple' dividend payment is go higher, not lower, in the come years. Currently, share yield 1.7%.IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.Tak flightOn of the most surpris stock that Warren Buffett ha bought in the past year is airlin stocks, includ Delta Air Lines, Inc. In the past, Buffett ha call airlin stock terribl investments, but he appear to have chang hi mind -- in a veri big way.In the third quarter, Berkshir Hathaway acquir roughli $1 billion worth of American Airlines, Delta Air, and Unit Continent stock. After the news of those purchas broke, Buffett told CNBC that he had pick up share in Southwest, too.Th scattershot approach to airlin could mean that Buffett' bet is less stock specif and more driven by the potenti for travel to pick up alongsid econom growth. With unemploy low, wage begin to climb more quickly, and corpor friendli tax reform on deck in Washington, D.C., there' reason to think that the travel industri could benefit from rise demand.If so, then Warren Buffett' decis to bulk up hi posit in airlin stock in the fourth quarter could be smart. In the quarter, Berkshir Hathaway' stake in Delta Air Line sky-rocket 847%. That 60 million-plu share stake in Delta Air Line is worth more than $3 billion, which make it Berkshir Hathaway' biggest airlin investment.Delta Air Line ha said it want to return 70% of it annual free cash flow to investors. Consid the company' recent histori of big dividend increas and the fact that share buyback are wrap up soon, investor might be get some good news from manag in the near future. The compani ha increas it dividend payout by 237.5% sinc 2013, includ a 50% increas last May. Given that Delta' payout ratio is onli 15.9%, it wouldn't be a surpris if anoth larg dividend increas come again thi year.Coupl the potenti reward of a rise dividend with the potenti for grow travel demand to support airfar and load factor, and mayb airlin aren't as terribl of an invest as they use to be.Get in on grainsWarren Buffett is also bet that Bayer' plan megamerg with grain giant Monsanto pass muster with regulators. Berkshir Hathaway' portfolio includ 8 million share of Monsanto as of Dec. 31.A a refresher, Bayer ink a deal to buy Monsanto last year for $128 per share in cash. However, thi merger would creat a global giant in seed and crop protection, and that may creat a lot of obstacl to overcom if the two hope to get govern approvals. Accord to number cruncher atBloomberg, the odd of thi deal close were about 40% on Valentine' Day.Thos odd could underst the likelihood of thi happening, however, given that the mood in Washington, D.C. ha becom far less anti-busi sinc November' election. In January, Bayer and Monsanto execut may have help their caus by offer promis to boost job and spend $8 billion in the U.S. if the deal closes.If the deal goe through, then the all-cash natur of thi acquisit could make Monsanto' stock worth own in portfolios. Monsanto' current trade at around $109, which is a 17% discount to the offer price.Even if the deal doesn't close, Monsanto won't walk away complet empty-handed. Bayer' on the hook to pay Monsanto a $2 billion break-up fee if the merger fall through. Even so, thi one isn't your typic buy-and-hold Warren Buffett buy, so investor might be better off look elsewhere.10 stock we like better than MonsantoWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Small-Caps Remain Some Of The Top Stocks To Invest In (MMYT),2/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh other day, a headlin in a financi public caught my attention. ""Small Is No Longer Beautiful,"" it read.makeArticleAd();I wa intrigued. I knew all about the strength in small-cap stock thi past year and how their strong post-elect ralli start to fizzl in December.But would I go so far as to predict that these stock have total lost their appeal compar with their larg and mega-cap peers?I don't think so.Yes, it' true that the Russel 2000, repres on the chart by theiShar Russel 2000 ETF(IWM), strongli outperform theS&P 500(SPY) index of U.S. large-cap stock over the past year.And it might also be true that the index wa get a littl ahead of itself, as suggest by it Decemb pause.Russel 2000 (IWM) Up Big Last YearBut I'm not interest in buy the index.InGame-Chang Stocks, my premium advisory, I am task with find compani - not indic - that are pois to break rules, outgrow competition, becom household name or start new trends. I scour the market for the top stock to invest in to follow develop technolog and trends. And here, small cap carri some advantages.Incredibly, even in our inform age, small-cap compani still don't get enough coverag compar with their large-cap peers.Virtu no develop can go unnot for larger tech firm likeAppl Inc.(AAPL) orFacebook Inc(FB). After all, more than 50 Wall Street analyst cover each company, not to mention TV and print journalists. On the other hand, major develop in mani smaller compani can go unnot for quit some time. These firm simpli fli under radar.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowSmal compani on the verg of technolog breakthrough or on the forefront of a new trend can be fulli expect to benefit from anoth featur of the market: Money is still cheap to borrow. Larg companies, especi tech leaders, have a lot of cash on their balanc sheets. That could lead to a spree of merger and acquisitions, which would be benefici to the small cap be pick up.Cash On Hand, Select Larg CapsWhen large-cap compani have thi much cash on hand, thi mean their abil to make money ha exceed their abil to be innovative. In such cases, buy smaller innov is often the easiest path to new breakthroughs. All thing considered, it' easi to predict that these tech giants' cash is go to provid long-term support to a period of strong merger-and-acquisit activity.And even if I'm overestim the willing of these tech giant to buy their smaller peers, the mere fact that their cash balanc have balloon to these incred amount should serv as a support (or a ""floor"") under the smaller-cap companies' share prices, especi for those compani that prove themselv to be on the forefront of the newest and most disrupt technologies.Th rule-break and the game-chang are, therefore, like to be in a posit to leverag their achiev as their large- and mega-cap peer remain under pressur from the market to deliv consist quarterli earn growth.A a group, small cap are also set to benefit from other new develop that can make them some of the top stock to invest in for 2017.One of those benefit is the tax reform expect from the new administration. Smaller compani are like to benefit more than the other from corpor tax cuts: These smaller organ usual have no resourc to util tax-avoid schemes, and they are usual more domestically-oriented, so they have less reason to stash cash abroad.Anoth reason for investor to continu concentr in smaller-cap stock is that there are liter thousand small-cap compani to choos from: The benchmark Russel 2000 Index contain 2,000 stocks, and there are also smaller, micro-capit stock not includ in the index. And that' even befor we consid intern small caps, such asMakeMyTrip Limited(MMYT).Of course, mid-cap and even large-caps, if they present especi compel cases, would not be off-limits, for me and myGame-Chang Stocksreaders. Not all of them are disrupters, of cours - not all of them are even ""growth"" stocks.But my job is to find those that are, and then to figur out the potenti of those companies, to identifi and discuss earli develop that are about to make them the top stock to invest in.Th 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsAni way you look at it, I think it' clear that there' still a place for small-cap stock in your portfolio.

Intel Corporation Reportedly Prepping 14-Nanometer LTE Modem for 2018 Shipments,2/16/2017,"Analyst with Bernstein Research distribut a note to client after microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) host it Feb. 9 investor meeting. In the note, the analyst say that Intel plan to introduc cellular modem manufactur in it 14-nanomet technolog (rather than on older, third-parti manufactur technologies) in the second half of 2018.The analyst say that Intel is not onli plan to introduc these chips, but that they plan to ship ""ten of million of units"" in the second half of 2018.Intel wireless chief, Aicha Evans. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();""Given the onli high volum purchas of stand-alon modem remain [Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ], thi suggest share at least maintain if not increased,"" the analyst write.Th report also say that Intel wa ""coy on CDMA capability"" but that the analyst ""believ it is a possibility,"" note that if Intel doe inde includ CDMA capabl in thi modem, it would be a ""further potenti headwind forQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) .""In thi column, I'd like to explain whi the move to an in-hous manufactur modem is so import for Intel and Apple, and whi inclus of CDMA capabl could neg impact Qualcomm, as the Bernstein analyst suggest.Th advantag of go in-houseRight now, Intel' modem are manufactur by a third parti (believ to beTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) , though Intel hasn't, to my knowledge, offici confirm this). Moreover, they are manufactur on rel old 28-nanomet chip technology.Bi move the modem in-house, Intel should enjoy sever benefit compar to it current manufactur arrangement.First, Intel must pay TSMC for each wafer of chip that the latter manufactures. Thi mean that Intel not onli bear the burden of the raw materi and manufactur costs, but TSMC mark those wafer up and make signific profit margin per wafer sold (in the ballpark of 50%).Bi move thi to in-hous manufacturing, Intel is still on the hook for raw materi and manufactur cost (and some will argu that Intel' per-waf manufactur cost are higher than TSMC's), but it doesn't need to fork over profit margin to TSMC.Instead, Intel could theoret be abl to either boost it own profit margin on the chip that it sell to Appl (thi assum that Intel' wafer cost aren't so high that they offset not have to pay TSMC' margins), or maintain the same margin that it did before, but lower it chip price to Appl (potenti open share gain opportunities).Beyond that, though, newer manufactur technolog tend to bring power effici benefit over older ones. The transit from TSMC' 28-nanomet technolog to Intel' 14-nanomet (presum an ""optimized"" 14-nanometer+ or 14-nanometer++ variant) technolog should enabl a signific reduct in both activ and stand-bi power -- potenti boost batteri life.Th more technic compet Intel' modem are (better power effici is clearli a valuabl exampl of that), the more like that Appl is go to want to use them in it products.Th CDMA questionRight now, Appl use Qualcomm modem in iPhon model that support the CDMA wireless standard and Intel modem in the iPhon model that don't. If Appl had to, it could use Qualcomm modem in everi singl iPhon sold and it wouldn't be a problem; the same can't be said about the Intel modem which wouldn't work properli on CDMA networks.If Intel can integr CDMA capabl into the modem that it' expect to ship to Appl for the 2018 iPhone, then Appl will presum be abl to use either Intel or Qualcomm modem interchangeably.That' a neg for Qualcomm becaus it open the compani up to either addit potenti share loss (Appl could keep Qualcomm in the loop but further reduc it allocation), or it could lead to an eros of Qualcomm' price power (in a recent lawsuit, Appl alleg that Qualcomm charg it extra for modem with CDMA capabl enabled).Neith situat would be good for Qualcomm' Appl business.A to whether we'll see CDMA in Intel' 2018 modem, it' interest that Intel wa reportedli ""coy"" about this, per Bernstein. Perhap Intel is work to build the technolog into that 2018 modem, but the compani isn't confid that the implement will be robust enough to pass carrier certif in the timefram that it would need to for Appl to be comfort use it.I do expect that Intel will eventu implement CDMA in futur modems, though.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Still, if you look at the 17 March $110 nake puts, you can sell two of them for $1.90 each, and earn $380. That just bare hit a 1.8% return, or 22% annualized.Even if MA stock get put to you and you decid you don't want it, you can alway turn around and sell cover call against those shares.

But it wa just enough to grant Appl the smartphon crown by 10 basi point to Samsung, which end the quarter with a global smartphon market share of 17.8%. You would have to go all the way back to the fourth quarter of 2014 to find Appl wa the undisput smartphon leader.""Samsung' smartphon sale start to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decis to discontinu the Galaxi Note 7 slow down sale of it smartphon portfolio in the fourth quarter,"" said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta, in a statement. Dure the third quarter of last year, Samsung wa forc to recal million of Galaxi Note 7 due to explod batteries.

Though fourth quarter profit came higher, thank to better-than-expect demand for the Galaxi S, there’ still the question of whether the Samsung can regain the custom it lost to Apple, which — thank to the success of the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu — continu to boast gain an increas number of switcher from other platforms.Apple’ success have translat to increas momentum in AAPL stock, which close Wednesday at a new 52-week high of $135.51.

From autonom vehicl to game to virtual realiti to cloud computing, NVDA is well-posit for continu success. You'll get no argument from me here.But Nvidia' success isn't exactli a secret at thi point, and that' becom a grow problem. For one, there' an inflat price for admission, with Nvidia stock sport lofti ratio such as a forward price-to-earn ratio of 33, price-to-sal of 8.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 3.4.7 Stock Warren Buffett Is Buy or SellingPlus, NVDA now face rise oper costs, potenti gross margin compression, as well as data center, custom silicon and GPU workaround competition.Nvidia could prove a veri costli investment.Fail that, the chart of NVDA stock is warn that a day of reckon is nigh.Nvidia Stock ChartClick to EnlargeWith NVDA share up roughli 300% in the past 52 weeks, trader buy share today are place a lot of technic faith in extrem momentum continuing, rather than an overdu cycl of profit-tak beginning.In my view, bullish at Nvidia' current price is misplaced.Aft 10 month of price action remain tether to Nvidia' upper Bolling Band, share are form a bearish top candl on the monthli chart. That' after hit a brief and margin all-tim high in the immedi aftermath of the earn report.Even the best-sounding, well-support growth narr eventu give way to meaning price corrections, even if they eventu resum their rallies. I don't expect Nvidia stock to be an anomali to that durabl tendency.How to Trade NVDA Stock Right NowOn strategi that could allow you to profit from a correct in Nvidia and/or buy share at a discount is an out-of-the-money credit put spread.I suggest the March $100/$95 put vertical.Trad of the Day: Market Vector Gold Miner ETF (GDX) Wave a Bull FlagNVDA stock is at $108.90, and the trade is price at 60 cents. The spread collect the full credit as long as share aren't below $100 at expiration.

At the same time, the vertic doe limit risk to $4.40 if the stock were to establish a stiffer correct below the protect $95 put strike.If we ultim want to buy NVDA stock on weakness, the most we'll pay is $99.40.Also, if Nvidia establish a larger (but still commonli corrective) move of 30% to $84.50 dure the life of thi vertical, the worst-cas scenario is that our initi purchas price would work out to $89.90 through either assignment, or close the spread and buy NVDA stock.Invest account under Christoph Tyler' manag do not current own posit in ani of the secur or their deriv mention in thi article.

Here's What Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling -- Should You Join Him?,2/16/2017,"Accord toBerkshir Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and compani had an activ fourth quarter in 2016. After sit on a compani record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and have said that Berkshir spent $12 billion on common stock in the wake of Donald Trump' elect victory, investor have been wonder what Berkshir ha been up to. Here' the answer.What Berkshir ha been buyingWhil we don't necessarili know the reason behind Berkshire' latest investments, or whether they were initi by Warren Buffett himself or one of hi trust stock pickers, we do know what chang in Berkshire' portfolio dure the fourth quarter. Here are the most notabl buys:Imag Source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();1.Apple-- Berkshir alreadi ownedApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , although the company' $2 billion stake wasn't a larg amount by Berkshire' standards. Dure the fourth quarter, Berkshire' Appl stake nearli quadrupl to about 57 million shares, which repres more than 1% of all the outstandingAppl stock. It' interest to note that Buffett' stock-pick were the one who initi the Appl investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Appl addit could have come from Buffett himself.Thi invest did not surpris me at all. I'vewritten beforehow Appl still repres a compel bargain at the price level it wa trade for dure the fourth quarter, and that Berkshir should take advantage. Well, apparently, manag agreed.2.Airlines-- Berkshir surpris mani investor when it reveal it third-quart 2016 invest in sever airlin stocks. After all, Buffett ha spoken out against airlin stock as invest sever time in hi career,Dur the third quarter, Berkshir invest inAmerican Airlines,Delta, andUnit Continental, and increas it stake in all three dure the fourth quarter. At the same time the initi airlin stake were revealed, Buffett also said he made an invest inSouthwest Airlines. He didn't specifi the amount at the time, but we now know it' a stake worth more than $2 billion.3.Monsanto-- Berkshir reveal a new stake inMonsanto, of about eight million share valu at about $872 million. Monsanto current trade for about $109 per share, and the compani plan to sell itself to Bayer for $128. If the deal goe through, Buffett stand to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinc at thi point.4.Siriu XM-- The final major chang wa the addit of a nearli 167 million share posit in satellit radio operatorSiriu XM. Granted, becaus of the company' $4.80 share price as of thi writing, thi stake translat into a rel small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment.What Berkshir ha been selling1.Wal-Mart-- Buffett ha been gradual trim hisWal-Martstak for some time, but he sold a substanti number of hi remain shares. Berkshire' invest in the retail giant ha been cut from about 13 million share to 1.4 million. As I'v mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of onlin retail like Amazon ha chang the competit landscap in a way Buffett doesn't like.2.Verizon-- Berkshir sold nearli all of it 15 million share ofVerizondur the quarter. Sinc Berkshir also unload itsAT&Tstak earlier in 2016, thi didn't come as a huge surpris to me.3.Kind Morgan-- Buffett bought about 20 million share ofKind Morganin earli 2016, and sold hi entir posit dure the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan ha nearli doubl from it earli 2016 lows, so thi could be a matter of the valuat simpli not look attract to Buffett anymore.4.Deere-- Just like Kinder Morgan,Deereha ralli sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, thi sale could potenti be due to a valuat issu as well.Should you follow Buffett' moves?Not necessarily. For one thing, by the time we even hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a complet differ market. Sinc the fourth quarter ended, the S&P ha risen by more than 4%, and some of the stock Buffett ha bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, ha risen by nearli 17% sinc the end of 2016, and Appl wa trade even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarili think Appl is too expens to buy right now, it' fair to say that Buffett and compani like got a far better deal on their Appl share than investor could get now.^SPXdata byYChartsIn addition, while it can be fun to speculate, we don't realli knowwhyBuffett bought or sold ani of these stocks. For that reason, it' import to do your own research and make your invest decis base on what' best for you and your long-term invest strategi -- not just becaus a billionair did it first.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Still, Appl doe have some of the attribut Buffett ha said he likes: It' a leader in it market, and it ha a ton of cash at it dispos ($246 billion in cash and secur as of the end of 2016).The Price Wa RightAt $135, Appl share are much pricier today than they were when Berkshir wa amass it stake. Dure 2016, the stock price rang from a low of $90 to a high of $118. Still, UB analyst say the price gain is deserv due in larg part to the high retent rate among iPhon buyers. UB rate Appl stock a ""buy,"" but pick up share all at onc at peak price isn't necessarili the best approach. Instead, take a cue from Buffett and spread out your buy to take advantag of ani period dips.Th Debut of iPhon 8Thi year mark the 10th anniversari of the iPhone, and compani watcher expect big thing when Appl unveil the latest version of the mobil device. Appl sold 5% fewer iPhon year-over-year dure the three month that end in September, the final quarter of it 2016 fiscal year. But year-over-year sale growth return in the Decemb quarter, up 5%, and the new iPhon 8 is expect to rejuven demand later thi year. (A releas date hasn't been announced.) Analyst believ the new smartphon will set sale record as it prompt user to upgrad from older iPhones.Tak the Quiz:How Well Do You Realli Know Warren Buffett?"

Does Warren Buffett Still Matter to Value Investors?,2/15/2017,"(1:00) - What Is Warren Buffett' Current Holdings?(5:05) - Should You Be Buy What Warren Buffett Buys?(9:40) - Tracey' Top Three Picks: Invest Ideas(13:00) - Episod SummaryWelcom to Episod #30 of the Valu Investor PodcastA the editor of theValu Investor portfolio service, I love look at valu stocks. Everi week, I share some of my top valu invest tip and stock picks.You might have notic that the big hedg fund and money manag had to file their Form 13F filings, which disclos what stock they bought and sold in the fourth quarter of 2016, by Februari 15.While it' backward look by at least 45 days, it still shine a window into what some of the biggest name in the invest busi are do with their money.On of the biggest of them all is Warren Buffett. Among valu investors, he is consid to be the greatest valu investor of all time. I know some investor who are so in awe, they tri and mimic hi stock move in their own portfolios.What were those move in the fourth quarter?Berkshir ad three new positions:1. Southwest Airlin (LUV) which is the fourth airlin Berkshir ha bought in the last 2 quarters. He also own Delta, America and United. I'm not a big fan of thi trade. You can check out theValu Investor Podcastwher I discuss Buffett' third quarter airlin buys, whi I didn't like those 3 buys, and whether or not the airlin were true valu stocks.Listen here>>.2. Monsanto (MON) which is just 0.57% of hi portfolio.3. Siriu XM Hold (SIRI), which is also a small posit overall, at just 0.5% of the portfolio.Buffett also ad to hi Appl (AAPL) posit which is now among the top 10 and is about 4.5% of the portfolio. I'v discuss how Appl is a valu stock in prior podcast so thi larger posit isn't a surprise.Concentr at the TopHi largest posit continu to be The Kraft Heinz Compani (KHC), which is about 19.2% of hi portfolio. It is hit new 52-week high in 2017.Although the portfolio wa hold 46 stock in the fourth quarter, it wa heavili concentr in the top 10 holdings. Those account for over 80% of the portfolio.Th top 5 positions, mani which have been held for years, read like a who' who of the Dow Industrials.What Happen When You Have Too Much CashThank to a record stock market, the market valu of Berkshire' hold ha soar to about $150 billion. That' a lot of cash to invest. The Kraft Heinz posit alone, in the fourth quarter, wa worth $28 billion.But thi also mean that Buffett and hi manag are stuck in a one-trick pony. They basic have to buy big cap stocks. The onli way to get small cap exposur is by buy the compani outright.Buffett ha talked, in the past, about wish he were in hi 40 again and investing. He would have a smaller portfolio and a longer time horizon in which to invest. These are ideal conditions.S the Opportun to Go SmallBuffett may be stuck with the larg caps, but you don't have to be.I'v talk about small cap value, and how histor it is one of the best invest in the entir stock market (yes, it beat growth over long periods).Y can listen to theValu Investor PodcastonSmal Cap for the Winto get all the detail on whi valu investor should be in small caps.Listen here>>Whil buy airlin and Appl aren't aw strategies, for those of us who don't have $100 billion to invest, there are so mani other intrigu options.3 Small Cap Valu Stock to Consid Instead of Buffett' Picks1. Gray TelevisionGTNha a forward P/E of 13.9 and a market cap of $821 million.2. Malibu BoatsMBUUha a forward P/E of 14.5 and a market cap of just $400 million. But, alas, it' not base in Malibu. It' headquart in Tennessee.3. Republ Bancorp Inc.RBCAAi one of the mani commun bank that are publicli traded. It' headquart in Louisville, Kentucky. It ha a forward P/E of 14.5 and a market cap of about $750 million. It pay a dividend, current yield 2.4%.While Warren Buffett still fascin valu investors, I'm urg you to look beyond hi move in the Berkshir portfolio.Ther are plenti of hidden valu opportun among the small cap that Buffett, no matter how much he want to get in, just can't buy.But you can.Find out what els I think about Berkshir Hathaway' fourth quarter stock move and valu stock in thi week' podcast.Subscrib to our podcast below:Souncloud:TuneIn:iTunesW more valu invest insights?Check out my weekli Valu Investor servic to receiv more in-depth analysi on valu compani and see which stock I think are the best bargain now.It hold between 20 and 25 valu stock for the long haul.Click here to learn more.W the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With ‘Windows Cloud’,2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsNot long ago,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) perfect the art of the big reveal. New Appl product announc would be shroud in mysteri for weeks, and then the late Steve Job would get up on a stage and wow consum and investor alik with the first-ev iPhone, the first-ev iPad or the first-ev iPod. AAPL stock would get an automat 10% to 15% bump in the day that followed. CouldMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) have a similarli secret catalyst in it so-cal Window Cloud product?makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Window Cloud is a mysteri oper system that wa reveal via leaks, prompt a ""noth to share"" respons from Microsoft last week.What Is the Window Cloud?A coupl websit post screen shot of Microsoft' yet-to-be-announc oper system, which would onli run Window Store app design to run on both desktop comput and mobil devices. The thought is that the Window Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company' Window 10 platform, which is onli 18 month old.Th Window Cloud is alreadi be view as Microsoft' answer toAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome OS. And by util onli it own apps, the platform could have a secur advantag over Chrome, which use non-n apps. That could posit Window 10 as a more appeal option to public institut like schools, where protect students' comput from outsid app or game can be difficult.Not much els is known about the Window Cloud platform. And that' probabl how Microsoft like it. Although Wall Street didn't immedi embrac the top-secret new product by snatch up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the compani actual doe it big Window Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-lik effect on Microsoft stock?7 Dividend Stock Reward Sharehold With a RaiseClick to EnlargeFirst, let' look at how MSFT stock ha been behav lately.Ther wa big spike in MSFT stock last month ha sinc been follow by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hover abov it 25- and 50-day move averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.What you don't see is ani kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the day sinc the Window Cloud leak occurred. That mean investor aren't quit sure exactli what the Window Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT' business, which is whi there ha been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.If more detail leak out, that could potenti move the needle. For now, though, the Window Cloud remain a rel mysteri that like ha Wall Street more confus than excited.MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'In the meantime, Microsoft look good on it own merits. MSFT stock is up nearli 30% in the last year, nearli 50% in the last two years, still trade at less than 20 time forward earn estimates, and is expect to grow earnings-per-shar by more than 6% thi year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkl in a potenti game changer in the Window Cloud, and there' no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is go to suddenli backtrack.On the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buy opportunity, so long as it hold abov those short-term move averages. I'd buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a futur Window Cloud unveil could spark a quick run-up the way Apple' secret product launch use to.A of thi writing, Chri Fraley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy Today7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Window Cloud'appear first onInvestorPlace."

Of course, the tech industri is chock-ful of exampl of darl that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when thi happens, the gain can certainli be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% dure the past coupl years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upsid or should investor remain wary? Let' take a look at three pro and three con and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobil Powerhouse:Th root of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engin team up to capit on the mobil industry. At first they focus on technolog to provid location-bas servic and messag for the truck industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, call CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.Th busi model wa to licens the technology, which would mean get aggress with patents. While success wa not immediate, QCOM wa determin to make CDMA a critic part of the mobil industry. And of course, thi wager ultim paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM' marque custom includeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteMegatrends:Th mobil market is expect to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continu demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are current about 4 billion 3G/4G connect use CMDA system and thi is expect to increas to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substanti benefit from the emerg of 5G technologies. These will allow for better perform for the Internet of Thing (IoT), wearables, autonom vehicles, virtual realiti and even remot medic procedures. While QCOM' R&D invest will be vital for capit on these trends, the compani ha also ramp up it deal-making. No doubt, the most notabl exampl of thi isth propos $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductor NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the compani is one of the top player in the fast-grow market for self-driv cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM' revenu are not grow at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there wa a4% increase. But then again, the compani is fairli mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remain a highli profit business, with fiscal 2016 net incom come to$6.7 billion. The compani ha also been sharehold friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attract 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Becaus of the extens patent portfolio, QCOM collect a hefti royalti from most sale of smartphon across the globe - even for those devic that do not even includ ani of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chines governmentchalleng QCOM' practices, and the case wa eventu settled.But there are other major case that are in the earli stages, such as in South Korea, Europ and the U.S. Oh, and Appl ha also launchedsever major lawsuit against QCOM. The compani certainli ha tremend resourc to wage a brutal fight. Now as with ani legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultim loses, then it core busi model will be in jeopardi and thi could certainli have horrend consequences. Keep in mind that the compani get about80% of it pretax profit from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president' agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump consid a currenc manipulator. He ha also call for stiff tariff and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is like to be advers to U.S.-bas compani that deriv substanti revenu from China. Let' face it, the govern is crack down, favor domestic-bas oper over foreign ones. All in all, thi pose materi risk for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescom from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rival includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexa Instrument Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a varieti of startup that are gun for the mobil market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultim be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel enter an agreement with Appl to suppli chips. Befor this, QCOM wa thesol supplier.In other words, if the legal battl go against the company, Intel may be in a better posit to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuat is definit attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn multipl is onli about 11.5X.3 Reason Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Head to ZeroBut thi may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litig is far from clear - and of course, legal disput often move at a glacial pace. So in light of this, it' probabl best to avoid QCOM stock for now.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand also ha hi own free iO app to estim your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

"Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) ha certainli made a tremend comeback sinc 2008, after have to declar bankruptcy. But there ha been littl for investor to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the compani pull off it IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at onli $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliv via Flickr (Modified)To put thing into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn ha noted: ""Ever sinc the 2008 crash and govern bailout, Gener Motor stock ha been treat like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actual think thi is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventu investor will recogn the value. Hey, thi ha happen with other stock that languish for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investor hold off? Well, to see, let' take a look at 3 pro and con on Gener Motors:3 Pro On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, Gener Motor ha post record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenu increas by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flow came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previou year.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteThen again, Gener Motor ha continu to pump out popular cars, with global sale at 10 million (make the compani the No. 3 player). A big part of thi ha been the continu success in North America. But of course, China remain a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sale in the country. Keep in mind that the compani sell more in China than ani country, includ the U.S.But GM ha also been judici with discount and promotions. For the most part, GM is focus on make sure it make profits, not just on increas marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categori in technolog is the auto industry, as seen with the effort with oper likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM ha been ramp up it investments. To thi end, the compani made a $500 million invest inLyft(a top ride-shar startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisit ofCruis Automation(a develop of autonom car systems).Alreadi there are sign that GM is get traction. For example, the compani is test over 40 autonom Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. Thi is a mobil platform that allow a person to search and reserv a car and unlock it with a smartphone. Accord toGM: ""With more than 25 million custom around the world project to use some form of share mobil by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategi to chang ownership model in the automot industry.""It' import to note that GM ha the advantag of leverag it experi with OnStar, which ha been around for two decades. In fact, dure thi time, the system ha log about1.5 billion custom interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM ha certainli been sharehold friendly. Last year, the compani return a hefti $4.8 billion - in a combin of share buyback and dividends. In fact, GM stock ha a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuat is also attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn ratio is at a lowli 6.1X. True, thi may be deserv for a compani that is show declin growth. But as for Gener Motors, the compani expect to increas the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock doe look like a great valu play right now.3 Con on GM StockCompetition: The environ is brutal. And with more dealmaking, thing will onli get more intense. An exampl of thi is the allianc ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involv the purchas of a larg stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the compani were abl to realiz signific cost save and also hit a global sale number of nearli 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automak may need to reach level of15 million car sold annual to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevit increas becaus of the enorm cost of new technologies.A a result, a compani like GM may have littl choic but to look for a similar allianc or a transform acquisition, which would definit be riski and expensive.Politics: The elect of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potenti positives, such as with lower corpor tax rate and less oner regulations.But these may not offset the issu with Trump' anti-trad bent. If there is a border tax, thi could hurt GM becaus of it substanti product in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light product is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher price in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. Accord to theWal Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consider would wipe out a quarter of GM' region profit.""Glob Issues:Whil the market in China and North America have been robust for GM, there ha been much soft in mani other areas, such as in Europ and South America. Granted, there are sign of improv - but the progress ha been fairli slow. For example, in South America, GM ha been abl to cut back on the losses. But there wa still $374 million in red ink last year.A for Europe, the growth ha been sluggish across the continent. It also doe not help that England ha enact the Brexit, which ha caus a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europ last year and it appear there will not be break-even until 2018. To put thing into perspective, the compani ha not seen a profit in the region sinc 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhap the biggest issu face GM stock is the uncertainti regard Trump' trade actions. Although, given the import of the auto industri to the US economy, it doe seem reason that ani move will like be taken with care. Besides, Gener Motor CEO Mari Barra ha been savvi to meet with Trump sever time already.Ga Up With Chesapeak Energi Corpor (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is do a great job manag the core oper of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refresh model for five main brand in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra ha been aggress with invest in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especi given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand also ha hi own free iO app to estim your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

But thi week, the momentum is reversing.On Tuesday, news broke that Appl ha gone ahead and sign a licens deal withSamsungto order OLE display for it iPhones. While the rumor doesn't extend to whether Appl will be put OLE display in all model of the iPhon 8 or just one, investor are take the bait either way. Yesterday,Appl stockhit a new all-tim intraday high of $135.09 -- and it' pull Univers Display stock up alongsid it.makeArticleAd();Her are three thing you need to know about that.OL screen -- and OLE stock -- are in focu today. Imag source: Getti Images.1. Susquehanna hail the newsIt' well-known thatUnivers Display is a supplierof OLE technolog and OLE materi to Samsung -- which we now know will in turn suppli OLE screen to Apple. So naturally, Univers Display share shot 3.6% higher in Tuesday trading, and were up a further 4% on Wednesday morning. Help to keep the momentum train move wa a new initi of coverag on the stock from Susquehanna. As report onStreetInsider.comaround about midnight last night, Susquehanna ha initi coverag of Univers Display stock with a ""positive"" rate and a big, round price target of $100.2. Stay tune for more newsSusquehanna' new rate impli a one-year profit potenti of nearli 50% on Univers Display stock, which current sell for just $67 and change. That' a big return for just one year' investment, and we'll get our first clue as to whether it' a realist hope next week.On Thursday, Feb. 23, Univers Display plan to releas it financi result for fiscal Q4 and full-year 2016.3. What analyst predictHere' what Wall Street analyst are tell investor to expect from that report: Profit growth of 8%, from $0.39 per share earn a year ago to $0.42 in profit for Q4 2016. And sale growth of onli 10%, with $68.6 million in quarterli sale expected.If these modest number seem like pretti slim reed to be support Susquehanna' expect of a 50% surg in stock price at Univers Display -- well, they may be. Base on it most recent report results, Univers Display stock current sell for nearli 79 time trail earnings, and 46 time trail free cash flow. But these number could be shrink soon, as Univers Display' sale (and earnings) increas to meet the new demand for OLE smartphon screens.Accord to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, analyst are look for Univers Display stock to earn onli $0.88 for fiscal 2016 as a whole. But that number is expect to jump 40% to $1.23 in fiscal 2017, then rise to $2.08 in 2018, and $2.80 in 2019. Put it all together, and forecast current call for a compound annual earn growth rate of 47%.What it mean for investorsAnd I think you'll agre --ifUnivers Display can hit the number Wall Street is lay out for it, then 47% annual growth should be suffici to support a stock sell for 46 time trail free cash flow.Wheth Univers Display stock can hit and maintain Susquehanna' new $100 target price though, and the even richer valuat that implies, is anybody' guess. It probabl depend a lot on whether Univers Display can both achiev the growth rate Wall Street is alreadi expect -- and then keep those rate grow further.10 stock we like better than Univers DisplayWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%,2/15/2017,"By Brett OwensTh technolog sector ha long been the growth investor' best friend, with tomorrow' innov fuel the breakneck gain necessari to gener big price returns. Tradit there hasn't been much to interest us dividend investor - until now.Som tech compani have final grown up. And while their profit growth ha slowed, their sharehold return have actual accelerated. These compani liter make more money than they know what to do with - so they are increasingli dish it back as dividends.Her are five tech titan with big cash flow pay yield up to 6%.makeArticleAd();Qualcomm (QCOM)Dividend Yield:4%Qualcomm (QCOM)ha wander it way back into 4% yield territory, but right now, the wireless technolog specialist is in extrem choppi waters.QCOM share have eaten 20%-plu loss sinc mid-Januari after Appl (AAPL) file suit against the company, and the Feder Trade Commiss file charg against QCOM, with Appl mention by name in the complaint. The seri of antitrust complaint put into jeopardi Qualcomm' extrem high margins, garner from licens out it telecommun technolog from a hoard of patents.Th compani ha alreadi been slap with an $853 million fine from South Korean regul over similar antitrust concerns, and the compani ha been face similar charg on the European front.Thes legal woe threaten more than just the busi model. They also will have regul look even more close at the firm' $38 billion deal to purchaseNXP Semiconductor (NXPI), prompt Nomura to downgrad Qualcomm in January.It' unfortunate, becaus Qualcomm ha been a serial dividend raiser that still had plenti of ceil with a 65% payout ratio.Could Qualcomm' (QCOM) Dividend Generos Be in Peril?QCOM might be a playground for specul bank on a big pop if the Apple, FTC and intern legal action start turn in Qualcomm' favor, but for right now, thi is not a long-term dividend buy-and-hold play.NV Corp (NVEC)Dividend Yield:5.3%NV Corp (NVEC)isn't a particularli new compani - it wa found in 1989 and went public in 2000 - but it spintron nanotechnolog ha been gain in popular for decades, and current ha the stock snif at all-tim highs.Spintronics, accord to the company, ""util electron spin rather than electron charg to acquire, store and transmit information."" The technolog ha a wide rang of uses. For instance, in Q3, the U.S. Armi award NVE Corp a small $141,000 contract for ""new ultra-fast spintron radar detector and spectrum analyz base on array of metal or metal/insul nano-scal magnet diodes.""However, the stock' rise doesn't match up with the fundamentals, which includ year of fairli stagnant top and bottom lines. But the real issu is the dividend, which doesn't seem to add up. NVEC pay out $1 quarterly, yet earn just $2.53 last year, and is expect to bring in $2.76 and $2.73 in profit over the next two years. On an annual basis, dividend have outstrip oper cash flow over the past coupl years, too.NV Corp (NVEC) Might Be Reach a PlateauNoth here scream immin collapse, but thi doesn't look like a particularli secur payout, and if anything, hike to the dividend seem unlikely. Plus, a forward P/E in the high 20 and price near all-tim high signal that now would be a terribl time to speculate.Seag Technolog (STX)Dividend Yield:5.5%Seag Technolog (STX)i a longtim maker of hard disk drives, solid state drive and other electron data storag solutions. It also ha been the sourc of heartburn for investors, who enjoy 600% gain from mid-2011 through 2015, then watch the bottom fall out by 70% through mid-2016.Sinc then, STX ha log a 130% rebound to reach it current price around $46.The one constant over that time ha been a rapidli improv dividend that surg from 18 cent to the current 63-cent payout - a 250% increas that ha share yield well more than 5% even as share continu to run hot.Look forward, the company' improv profit mean the dividend is safe and like ha room for improvement. Analyst are track earn of $4.49 per share thi year and $4.55 next, which put the company' payout ratio at a comfort 55%.But growth seem almost entir out of the picture. Revenu have been on the declin sinc 2012, and the top line is expect to slip in each of the next two year - all of thi mirror the shrink PC market that Seagat feed off.Seagate' (STX) Dividend Compens for a No-Growth StorySeag should continu to be a consider sourc of incom go forward, and may yield well more than the 5.5% it current boasts. Ani addit capit gain from here would simpli be gravi ... but don't bet the farm on them.Iron Mountain (IRM)Dividend Yield:6%Data storag real estat invest trustIron Mountain (IRM)ha been point in the same gener direct - up - ever sinc it 1996 initi public offering, but the go over the past few year ha been simpli nauseating. In just the past year' worth of trade alone, IRM ha regist a 55% up-leg, a 25% dive and a 16% rebound.Still, if you'r will to close your eye and wait out the roller coaster,IRM can be a fruit investment.Whil Iron Mountain offer a number of digit services, includ cloud backup and data management, it also provid actual physic record storage, shred and even busi solutions. In other words, it provid legaci physic servic in a nich that few compani want to compet in, and it ha it hand in the grow digit storag cooki jar.Th compani reorgan as a REIT in 2014, and that began Iron Mountain' transform into a full-blown dividend powerhouse. The company' most recent 48.5-cent payout is an 80% improv over it last quarterli distribut from it pre-REIT life. And IRM' substanti yield ha power the major of the stock' return over the past few years.Iron Mountain (IRM) Keep Crank Out DividendsIron Mountain' financi are as temperament as the share price, with revenu and earn vacil from year to year. But the pure incom potenti make IRM worth it.Nokia (NOK)Dividend Yield:6%Nokia (NOK)i no longer the fine purveyor of seemingli invinc cellular phones, but instead pli it trade in telecommun infrastructur and, like Qualcomm, licens out it expans set of technolog patents.However, Nokia ha come up against a few walls.Nokia, which previous went to war with Appl over patent infringement, is swing at the Cupertino tech giant again over a set of 32 tech patents. As a result, manag say roughli 150 million euros' worth of patent are off the tabl for 2017.That' a shorter-term problem that could rectifi itself in a year. More troubl for Nokia is weak in the wireless market that ha led to a signific downturn in revenu that didn't get ani better in 2016, slide 10% year-over-year.Nokia' annual dividend, while gener at a roughli 6% yield, ha been on a longer-term declin as well.Nokia (NOK) Pay a Lot, But Is Pay LessNokia' annual dividend isn't nearli as consist as typic American quarterli dividends, which even in leaner time tend to at least remain constant.

It' pretti clear whi it decid to do so -- the servic segment is the onli aspect of Apple' busi that is still grow consistently.On the first quarter earn call last month, Appl CEO Tim Cook announc an ambiti goal of doubl the company' servic revenu in the next four years. That' a big reason whyAppl stockha ralli more than 10% in the past few weeks, reach a new all-tim high.makeArticleAd();Appl YTD Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Plenti of analyst and other pundit areskept that it will be feasibleto doubl the servic busi in four years, bar a big acquisition. But here are three reason whi doubl the servic busi might not be so hard after all.Servic growth is acceleratingFirst, the servic segment' growth trajectori is better than it seems. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, Appl report an 18% year over year increas in servic revenue, down from 26% growth a year earlier.Thes figur make it seem like Apple' servic growth is alreadi slowing. Consid that Appl need to grow it servic revenu at a 19% compound annual rate to doubl it in four years, thi would be an omin sign.However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Appl benefit from a one-tim $548 million gain relat to a patent infring lawsuit. Exclud that patent revenue, Apple' servic revenu grew onli 15% in Q1 2016, but surg 30% year over year last quarter. Thus, Appl doesn't even need to maintain it recent servic growth rate to hit it target.Th App Store is gain scaleA second factor work in Apple' favor is that the App Store ha recent becom the largest contributor to Apple' servic revenue.App sale have been grow at a fast clip for mani years, but Appl onli report it net revenu from the App Store. The portion of App Store sale that goe to develop -- which rang from 70%-85% -- doesn't show up in Apple' financi statements. Appl earn an extrem high profit margin on App Store revenu due to thi account policy, but the growth of thi revenu stream hasn't been veri materi until recently.Wal Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi estim that Apple' net App Store revenu reach $7.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year that end last September. That would make it the largest piec of Apple' servic segment, ahead of iTunes, which face secular revenu declines.Furthermore, the App Store continu to grow at a phenomen pace. Last month, Appl report that developers' earn rose more than 40% year over year dure 2016. The pace of growth is sure to slow over time, but App Store revenu is on a trajectori to more than doubl in the next four years, provid a good chunk of the servic revenu growth Appl is targeting.Th iPhon Upgrad Program could lift AppleCar revenueGrowth of the iPhon Upgrad Program is a third factor that could contribut to increas in Apple' servic revenue. For as littl as $32.41/month, thi program allow custom to get a new iPhon everi year by trade in their old one. Purchas under the iPhon Upgrad Program includ AppleCare+ enhanc warranti coverage, which is worth $129.The iPhon Upgrad Program is boost AppleCare+ revenue. Imag source: Apple.Mani iPhon fan have alreadi enrol in the iPhon Upgrad Program, but there' still plenti of room for growth. Appl could potenti expand the program to more countries. It could also consid creat similar program for other devic like the Appl Watch.Thes Apple-oper upgrad program can drive signific servic revenu growth becaus AppleCare+ is part of the bundle. Veri few of these custom would be buy AppleCare+ if it were still sold separately.A big reason for optimismApple' servic busi produc more than $24 billion of revenu in fiscal 2016, up from less than $20 billion a year earlier. Thi allow it to surpass both the iPad and Mac product line to becom Apple' second-largest segment by revenue.Even if Appl miss it target of doubl it servic revenu by 2020, it will certainli get a meaning amount of revenu growth from that segment. With strong servic growth ensur that Apple' non-iPhon revenu will rise consist in the year ahead, Appl will be well posit to return to strong earn growth as the next iPhon sale cycl heat up.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett's Huge Stake in Apple: What He May See In AAPL,2/15/2017,"Warren Buffett and Berkshir Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) have long been advers to invest in technolog companies. That mantra start to chang in 2011, when Berkshir startedinvestingin IBM (IBM).Sinc then, hi invest manag lieutenants, Todd Comb and Ted Weschler, have ad to Berkshire' invest portfolio, buy up stake in technolog companies, but never to the size and scope of the IBM investment, which wa $11 billion at the time.Now, it look as if Buffett is do it again -- thi time with Appl (AAPL).makeArticleAd();In a recent releas SEC filing, Buffett' Berkshir Hathaway reveal it now own a sizabl stake in the Cupertino, Calif.-bas tech giant. At the end of the fourth-quarter, it own 57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million share in a previou filing. At current prices, the stake is worth just over $7 billion, like make the stake with Buffett' approval, if not done himself.Without put word into hi mouth, the Appl stake is like similar to IBM in Buffett' eyes, as the vener iPhon maker is becom a servic company, one with steadi revenu come from depend subscriptions.Buffett' invest isn't about what technolog is the ""next big thing,"" whether augment realiti is asbiga Appl think it will be or whether Appl is realli make a car or not. It' pure and simpl econom and the attract of the subscript model.In Apple' fiscal first-quarter, itgenerated$7.1 billion in Servic revenue, from thing like Appl Music, iTunes, the App Store, Appl Pay and more. It' the healthiest portion of Apple' business, one that' grow at 18% year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook hassaidthat Apple' Servic busi will be the size of a Fortun 500 compani sometim thi year, indic that growth isn't slow down anytim soon.Yes, Appl is still beholden to sale of the iPhone, iPad and the Mac for the major of it revenue, but the Servic busi is slowly, but surely, make Apple' revenu smoother and less lumpier from a quarterli perceptive. Visible, grow revenu is worth significantli more than revenu from hardwar that act like a roller coaster, with up and downs.Al investor need to do is look at the earn multipl for compani like Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and other to see the posit impact. Compani that have enorm subscription-bas revenue, which put off tremend amount of oper cash flow in a predict manner are ultim more valuabl than one that do not.Th compani ha a goal of doubl it Servic revenu by 2020, which is an admittedli larg task. But with a user base of over 1 billion activ devices, Appl should be abl to continu to grow part of it Servic business, like Appl Music and the App Store, as it continu to add new featur (namely, TV show for Appl Music).It' like we will hear more about Buffett' Appl stake in the day and week to come. If we do get commentari from the Oracl of Omaha himself, expect Servic and predict revenu to be a big part of the line of thinking.I know it would be for me."

The competit in the payment industri is too fierc for ani compani not constantli innov to flourish for long. Dure the confer call follow the quarterli earn release, new CEO Al Kelli identifi six guid pillar he believ are crucial to Visa' foundat and futur growth. The last of these pillar is digit expansion, which Kelli believ is best repres by Visa' heavi invest in Visa Checkout. Kelli said:E-commerc enabl by mobil and other form factor is a signific opportunity. And we are definit invest behind it. As payment move from the physic to digit world, we'r lead the way in develop solut for our clients, our partner and consumers. One great exampl of thi is Visa Checkout.

The compani also open the platform to it card-issu partners, allow them to integr their own digit wallet into Visa Checkout. Judg by the numbers, these effort have yield decent results.I the growth enough to justifi anoth digit wallet?Despit the headi growth, though, there still seem to be some linger question in CEO Kelly' mind about whether the heavi invest in resourc and effort are worth it. Later in the confer call, when answer a question from an analyst, he express some of these doubts:Mi person view is that there are too mani wallet out there. Consum are not go to ultim want to have 50 wallets. And we'r not necessarili anxiou just to be in the wallet busi per se, but we'r anxiou to be -- to take advantag of us be a trust accept mark in the payment eco space and want to be abl to make sure that we'r take a lead posit in establish Visa as a trust mark and as an import partner to our issuer in term of them tri to establish as much volum as they can get in the digit space.Thes misgiv are probabl justified.

Appl Pay also experienc explos annual growth, as CEO Tim Cook announc transact volum had grown by more than 500% year over year in the company' 2017 first-quart confer call.Doubt or not, Kelli know Visa cannot just walk away from host a digit wallet. In the quot above, he acknowledg that the company' card-issu bank partner want ""a much volum as they can get in the digit space."" These bank are ultim Visa' real customers, and Visa cannot afford to lose ani simpli becaus it doesn't want to invest in the space. For thi reason alone, it is well worth Visa' time and resourc to continu to innov and market Visa Checkout.

"Apple, Inc.'s First 2 Original TV Shows Are Almost Here",2/14/2017,"Investor have known for quit some time thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ispush into origin content, primarili as a way to differenti it Appl Music servic from rival music streamers. Appl ha been invest in a hand of new TV show that will be exclus to Appl Music, and the first two are almost here.Th first is a realiti TV seri that focus on app and app developers, calledPlanet of the Apps. Celebr advisor Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gari Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am will offer to guid new develop in an effort to win fund from promin Silicon Valley ventur capit firm Lightspe Ventur Partners, which incident is about to make a fortun on an app it fund year ago:Snap.Appl start cast for the show last summer, which is kind of likeTh Voicemix withShark Tankbut for apps. Speak at the Code Media confer last night, Appl servic chief Eddi Cue said the show would debut in the spring on Appl Music as well as through a dedic app. Episod will be releas in a linear fashion, one at a time (sorry, bing watchers).makeArticleAd();Th second isCarpool Karaoke, which is base on the popular segment of the same name fromTh Late Late Showwith Jame Corden. Thi one wa alreadi publicized, as no one can forget CEO Tim Cook sing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" at WWDC last year befor confirm that the seri wa come to Appl Music. The show will featur 16 celebr hosts, and will likewis be releas weekli instead of all at once.Personally, neither show look particularli compel to me. But that' precis the challeng that Appl now faces.If the strategi fails, it will fail (relatively) cheaplyGiven the extrem divers spectrum of consum prefer when it come to video content, Appl will need to creat content across a wide rang of genr that appeal to a wide rang of consum if the compani truli want to posit origin content as a differenti and sell featur in a meaning way. As Appl Music expand around the world, Appl will also need to local content and cater to local prefer in geograph region all around the world.That'sexpensive, and a tough balanc even for pure-play media compani that special in and have deep experi with content. Appl ha neither, even if it ha deep pockets. Furthermore, the compani ha made it quit clear that it it content strategi is intend to bolster Appl Music, and ha no intent to launch a stand-alon video stream servic (although not for a lack of trying). Besides, who subscrib to a music servic specif in order to get video content?Appl Music. Imag source: Apple.However, there is some potenti forPlanet of the Appsto inspir a new gener of developers, which would be a secondari benefit. Appl reli heavili on it armi of third-parti develop to keep it digit repositori flush with app content, and cultur reinforc it pipelin of develop is a good thing. The show may serv in part as a giant episod market campaign to come develop for iOS.Thi is like just the begin for Apple, and presum the compani will diversifi it content strategi further go forward. Fortun for investors, the risk are fairli modest for a compani of thi size. While show are expens -- a season can easili cost ten of million of dollar -- they'r much less than if Appl were to pursu some sort oftheoret blockbust acquisitionaround video streaming. On top of that, Appl Music' revenu run rate is in excess of $2.4 billion right now, base on the 20 million subscrib it disclos in December.I still think the origin content strategi is misguided, but at least the financi risk are small if it fails.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Finding the Gems in the Dow,2/14/2017,"In late January, the Dow Jone Industri Averag hit 20,000, a mileston that wa met with plenti of fanfare. Like mani stock market-rel headlines, however, the Dow' big day should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, it repres a rise in the index, and that' not a bad thing, but the number itself realli isn't significant.A a matter of fact, break 20,000 isn't even that remark when you consid the trajectori of the Dow sinc it incept in 1896. It took over a decad to reach 100, then 66 year to reach 1,000, then anoth 41 year to make 15,000 (in May 2013). In fact, it hover around 10,000 for a decade:makeArticleAd();Al thing considered, rise by 5,000 in three-and-a-half year isn't that big a deal.Th Motley Fool' Daniel Kline writes, ""In practic terms, 20,000 mean nothing. It' just a round number, and it' easier to celebr those than pick a random one."" He say Trump' promis to eas regul and lower busi tax were key driver behind the Dow' push and argues, ""Becaus Trump is someth we have never seen before…w have no idea what might happen becaus there is no precedent.""Moham El-Erian, Bloomberg columnist and chief econom advis for Allianz, is equal dispassion about the market event. ""Let' start by acknowledging,"" he writes, ""that the DJIA is far from comprehens when it come to analyt content. The index cover a veri narrow set of stock and therefor is lack in representation."" He argu that evalu the implic of the ""hype about the Dow reach 20,000 come down to evalu the volum of the signal, the influenc on invest and busi behaviors, and the implic for econom governance.""Lik others, I think the import of thi mileston ha a rel short shelf-life. Eventually, the market will move on to more signific thing like corpor earnings, valuations, industri developments, and relat issues. That said, I think the market event present two import takeaway for investors:Th power of long-term invest and compound returns. Over long period of time, the stock market is one of the best way to gener long-term wealth. Sinc 1928, the Dow Jone 30 ha produc an annual return of about 10%, includ dividends. By reach 20,000, the Dow remind us of the long-term wealth creation that can be achiev when invest in the market over time with discipline. If the return over the next 7-10 year are close to the 10% annual return the Dow ha gener historically, we could see Dow 40,000 by around 2025-2027.Return don't come in a straight line. If you are just get into the market now or you have fund to put to work, you shouldn't expect the same return in the market over the next five year that the last five year have generated, and there will be plenti of bump along the way. The reason that stock produc the return they do is becaus they are riski in the short term. When you get excit by event like the Dow hit 20,000 and think you might be miss out, alway rememb that you have to be abl to stomach short-term volatil to get the long-term gain stock have produced.Us my guru-bas stock screen models, I found the follow high-scor pick among the Dow 30:Intern Busi Machin Corpor (IBM)i a technolog compani that oper through five segments: Global Technolog Servic (GTS), Global Busi Servic (GBS), Software, System Hardwar and Global Financing. The compani earn a perfect score under our Jame O'Shaughnessy-inspir stock screen model base on it size ($168.5 billion) and cash flow-per-shar of $17.11 which is well abov the market averag of $1.43.

With revenu growth of 13.63% and earn growth of 8.9% (base on 3, 4 and 5 year averages), UNH pass thi screen. The compani also earn a perfect score under our O'Shaughnessy-bas model due to it size (market capit of $152.7 billion) and persist in earnings-per-share.Verizon Commun Inc.

The compani is favor by our David Dreman-bas screen model due to it size (market cap of $198.9 billion). Medium to large-s compani (the largest 1500 companies) are prefer by thi model becaus they are more in the public eye and an investor is less expos to risk of ""account gimmickry"". VZ earn a perfect score under our O'Shaughnessy-bas invest strategi due to it cash flow-per-shar of $7.24, well abov the market mean of $1.43, and it dividend yield of 4.73%.Appl Inc.

Usually, these are base on inform leak from the AAPL suppli chain, but on a veri few occasions, Appl itself inadvert tip it hand.makeArticleAd();Source: Wireless Power ConsortiumThat appear to be the case with the iPhon 8. For sever months, the 10th anniversari releas ha been rumor to featur wireless charging. Thank to an AAPL move, that now seem like a lock.AAPL Join the Wireless Power ConsortiumBusi Insiderbrok the newsthat Appl ha join the Wireless Power Consortium (or WPC). WPC is an industri associ that overse Qi, the most wide use wireless charg technology. That put AAPL in a group with over 220 other compani that are members, includ smartphon rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), whose Galaxi S7 support Qi wireless charging.Appl doe alreadi use Qi wireless charg for the Appl Watch, but the compani tweak it implement so it' not compat with standard Qi chargers. And it never bother to join WPC - until now. That move is a veri strong indic that AAPL is plan to incorpor Qi wireless charg on a larger scale, and that point to the iPhon 8.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveAppl confirm it had join WPC (although the confirm isn't realli necessari given that it' nowlist as a memberon the organization' website), but it did so by tri to minim the implications. A compani spokesperson toldBusi Insider:""Appl is an activ member of mani standard develop organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Appl is join the Wireless Power Consortium to be abl to particip and contribut idea to the open, collabor develop of futur wireless charg standards. We look forward to work togeth with the WPC and it members.""What WPC Membership Mean for iPhon 8 Wireless ChargingDespit AAPL' attempt to posit it move as busi as usual, join WPC is a strong indic that rumor about the iPhon 8 offer wireless charg have been on the mark. However, Qi isn't the advanced, over-the-air wireless charg mani peopl had been hope AAPL would implement.Instead, Qi - which ha been in use sinc 2011- use induct charging. Rather than plug an iPhon into a charger with a Lightn cable, it would be place on a charg pad. So there' still a recharg that requir physic contact, and that recharg is still plug into the wall.And it seem veri plausibl that wireless charg would be support by the iPhon 8, but onli offer as an extra at an addit cost. There ha alreadi been specul that AAPL would useopt wireless chargingto further drive up the amount consum spend on a new iPhon purchase. In thi case, they would have to add an Appl wireless charger to the tab (somethingSamsung charg an addit $49.99 forwith the Galaxi S7).Couldn't iPhon 8 buyer simpli buy one of the mani Qi charg pad alreadi on the market? They would undoubtedli be less expens than Apple' version.Well, there' also a good chanc that AAPL could pull a move like it did with the Appl Watch, tweak it Qi implement slightli so someon buy the new iPhon couldn't simpli use a standard third-parti Qi charger.Wil Qi Wireless Charg Make the iPhon 8 More Desirable?IH Technolog note thepopular of wireless charg with consumers, suggest it wa a featur AAPL couldn't ignor with the iPhon 8:""The success of wireless charg adopt from Apple' competitor is someth that Appl can no longer ignore. IH Technolog consum survey data show over 90% of consum want wireless charg on their next device.""Consum may be expect somethingmorefrom the iPhon 8, though.Qi wireless charg is mainstream now, and there were hope Appl would adopttruewireless charging, go with over-the-air technolog instead of follow the pack.

For many, thi mileston is just one signal of cryptocurrency’ grow reput as a legitim store of invest value.Littl attention, however, ha been given to Bitcoin’ util as a day-to-day method of payment. Practic use case involv consum adoption, in fact, are rare talk about. Thi is despit the well-docu cost, effici and secur advantag of the Bitcoin payment network for both consum and busi alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-bas startup compani aim to chang thi through an effort to acceler the everyday use of Bitcoin for consum worldwide. Launch in May of 2016,iPayYoui an onlin platform and digit wallet that promot the viabil of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immedi saw earli success through a uniqu featur known as Pay-by-Twitt — the first onlin platform site for peer-to-p payment over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliv a caffein jolt to the retail sector, iPayY thi past Decemb introduc Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck (SBUX), a new way for coffe aficionado to pay for those espresso and other drink through the use of Bitcoin.Thi featur allow user to seamlessli transfer bitcoin from their exist iPayY Bitcoin wallet to their Starbuck mobil app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer befor prompt Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck to automat withdraw that amount from their iPayY account. Onc deposit into that person’ Starbuck account, purchas can be made via the mobil app at ani Starbuck location.Thi latest addit to the iPayY platform come on the heel of iPayYou’ recent gift card integration, allow Bitcoin to be use for instant gift card purchas from retail like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTun (AAPL).Thes creativ payment applic are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwid Director of Amazon Associates. With extens experi in the world of commerce, includ promin posit at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner develop iPayY with the intent of establish a easy-to-us Bitcoin wallet with simpl featur and low costs.Regard the strateg collabor with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader signific of thi move is that iPayY is abl to encourag Bitcoin to be spent in way that it creator intend — for everyday purchas from popular merchant without need a bank account to do so. Thi arrang with Starbuck allow coffe lover to replenish their primari Starbuck account with their Bitcoin holdings. We’v accomplish thi feat without Starbuck have to directli accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through thi demonstr Starbuck will soon begin accept Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In term of advantag for Starbuck regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not onli a great invest but is also becom quit use in everyday life. Becaus so mani of us are addict to coffee, be abl to use Bitcoin to purchas anyth at Starbuck is an enorm win for everyday consumers. And Starbuck will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin user who will now becom customers.”Ov time, Kavner believ that initi like thi will encourag merchant accept of Bitcoin. “Probabl the most import metric that everi merchant look at when decid what method of payment to accept is how mani new custom will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adopt of Bitcoin ha been the rel limit amount of peopl who want to use Bitcoin for PO transactions. Now, I believ that more and more will.”In term of what’ next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’r go to continu to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more use over 2017 and beyond. We are plan on expand to enabl more merchant adopt as well as ad mani featur that everi Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simpl to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin alreadi but for the everyday consum who may not even know what Bitcoin is.

Imag source: Intel.Thi ""bridge"" show that Intel expect oper expens to drop year-over-year due to the spin-off of it Intel Secur group (which will now be a stand-alon compani call McAfee) as well as reduct in it Client Comput Group (CCG) invest levels.Offset those declines, though, is an increas in invest level in what the compani collect refer to as it ""growth businesses"" -- Data Center Group, Internet of Thing Group, and Non-Volatil Solut Group.Additionally, Intel say it' invest more in Moore' Law, which mean that it' boost it invest in next gener manufactur technologies.

I'd imagin that part of that increas is due to the share expens allocation, but I also expect that Intel is increas it invest here in way beyond simpli a reshuffl of expenses.Intel' invest in non-volatil memori -- a busi that Intel expect to be a key growth engin in the year ahead -- are go up 40%. Consid that technolog strength is critic to succeed in the non-volatil memori busi (better technolog usual translat into a better cost structure, allow a compani to more effect compet at good margin levels), the boost in spend isn't a surprise.Th company' invest in mobil are go to be down 55% per the slide. That' not surpris consid that Intel ha refocus it mobil busi away from tri to build a broad rang of platform to address the broad rang of smartphon toward focus primarili on stand-alon cellular modems, withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) be the company' princip (only?) smartphon custom here.And, finally, Intel is expect a big boost in it invest within it Internet of Thing Group. Thi busi ha been grow steadili over the last sever year and manag had indic that they'r make some big bet on new area like self-driv cars, so a larg increas in research and develop spend here make sens -- especi as the odd that those invest will ultim pay off look good.Intel' sensibl spend shiftsAt the end of the day, these spend shift are quit reason -- the compani is feed those busi segment that have been grow and have the potenti to continu to grow, and it' cut back in area that aren't expect to grow (i.e. PC processors) as well as in area where it effort have fallen flat and success appear unlik (mobil system-on-chip).Intel manag is invest for the long-term, which is the right thing to do. However, invest in high technolog usual take year to bear fruit, so don't expect these increas invest made today to pay off tomorrow. It'll be a coupl of year befor we know if Intel' increas invest will ultim pay off.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don’t Count Out Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Just Yet,2/14/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBack on Jan. 30, I quip thatNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) wa go to return to record highs. Of course, NVDA stock did just that, hit $120.92 just three day prior to Nvidia' fourth-quart earn report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the love affair with $120-plu price wa short-lived, and a strong sell-on-the-new bid follow earn sent Nvidia stock on an 11%-plu bender.Earn were far from bad. In fact,th compani blew past Wall Street' estimatesbi 16 cent per share on revenu that soar 50% year-over-year. Unfortun for NVDA stock holders, the pre-earn ralli left specul hungri for profits, and the ""weak"" second-quart guidanc of $1.9 billion (analyst are expect $1.88 billion) just wasn't enough to sustain level of euphoria head into the report.If you were lucki enough to get into the Feb $115/$120 call spreadI recommend on Jan. 30, I hope you got out at the top on Feb. 7 and lock in a maximum return on the trade. There realli wa no reason to hold those NVDA option ani longer onc the stock top $120.Alternately, if you opt for the Feb $100 put sell position, you lock in a nice profit of about $137 per contract when these option expir last Friday.But with Nvidia still caught in the throe of miss expectations, where doe that leav trader now?Nvidia Sentiment and TechnicalsFor one thing, sentiment ha improv sharpli on the NVDA option front sinc I last check in on the shares, hint at elev expectations. At the time, the the Feb. put/cal open interest ratio rest at a lofti 1.31, but the equival March put/cal OI ratio ha fallen to 0.8, with call now outnumb put among short-term options.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowFurthermore, Wall Street analyst haven't budg an inch on their bullish Nvidia stance. Thomson/First Call rate stand exactli where they were head into earnings, with 21 of the 35 analyst follow NVDA stock rate the share a ""buy"" or better.And herein lie the problem.Nvidia stock is satur with hype right now. So much so, that smart money is probabl sell NVDA to take advantag of the situation. Keep in mind that thi doesn't mean the stock' long-term uptrend won't remain intact. But a short-term correct could shake out the weak hands, thu allow smart money to step back in when the price is right.So, what' the right price? Well, that all depend on your trade outlook, but I would argu that NVDA stock is a bargain buy on ani trade below $100 given the company' prospect for 2017 and beyond.For short-term option traders, however, the equat is much simpler: Where do impli suggest the stock will be trade in the next coupl of months?Click to EnlargeFor this, we turn to March implieds, and discov that option are price in a potenti move of about 6.2% for NVDA stock. Thi place the upper bound at about $114, while the lower bound rest near key support at $100.2 Trade for NVDA StockCal Spread:Whil smart money may be sell NVDA stock right now, I'm not will to bet against the share just yet. Nvidia' fourth-quart report wa noth short of stellar, mean bargain hunter are bound to step in sooner rather than later.Intel Corpor (INTC) Stock Will Claw It Way HigherTrad look to take on a bit of risk and bet on a return to form for NVDA stock might consid a March $110/$115 bull call spread. At last check, thi spread wa offer at $1.66, or $166 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lie at $111.66, while a maximum profit of $3.34, or $334 per pair of contracts, is possibl if Nvidia close at or abov $115 when March option expire.Put Sell:But if an outright call spread is a bit too much risk to take on at the moment, the $100 put sell trade still look like a winner. Just roll that strike out to the March series, and you'r set.At last check, the March $100 put wa bid at $1.39, or $139 per contract. If Nvidia offer up a repeat perform in March and close abov $100 at expiration, then you get to keep the premium received. But, if NVDA stock trade below $100 ahead of expiration, then trader may be assign 100 share at a price of $100 per share, for everi contract sold.A of thi writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTrad of the Day: New High for Appl Inc.

The dividend is as secur as it can be, have been rais everi year for 54 straight years.Proct & GambleBerkshir wa a longtim sharehold in Gillett when Procter & Gambl acquir the razor blade compani in 2005. Buffett call it a ""dream deal,"" as Berkshir receiv P&G share in exchang for it Gillett holdings. As with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett reluctantli sold some P&G share in 2008 to rais cash to invest in distress companies. Cut to 2014. Berkshir struck a deal to buy Duracel from P&G. To avoid a big tax bill, Berkshir arrang to hand over it P&G share rather than pay cash for Duracell.Th stock today: William Blair Equiti Research rate P&G at ""outperform,"" note that it focu on major brands, such as Tide detergent, and cost cut offer ""a solid total sharehold return opportunity.""

""Verizon is like an invest of Todd Comb or Ted Weschler, who have sever telecom stock in their portfolio,"" say Kass of Buffett' two chief stock-pick lieutenants. Either way, Berkshir all but abandon it posit at the end of last year, sell most of it 15 million shares.Th stock today: The first thing that stand out with Verizon is the high dividend yield. Even better for incom investor is the fact that the compani ha rais it payout everi year sinc 2006. However, most analyst think the stock will underperform the S&P 500 thi year.

In anoth first, a key new Android featur - Googl Assist - wa a Pixel Phone exclusive. Googl Assist leverag Alphabet' latest AI technolog in a person digit assist that goe beyond Googl Now, even gain the abil to particip in two-way conversations.Th situat wa seriou enough to help convinc Android smartphon leaderSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) that it need it own person assistant.

By contrast, at the time of their respect IPOs, Facebook and Twitter were grow nearli twice as fast. Dure 2016, Snapchat ad 51mn DAUs, globally; by comparison, Facebook ad 190mn DAU in 2016. Our check indic that Facebook maintain a substanti lead in mobil app downloads… We come away reassur that Facebook maintain the abil to mitig competit threat via product innov […] Snapchat' user growth deceler through 2H16, follow the launch of Instagram Stories.""In other words, when Facebook went public back in 2012, it wa pick up steam. Snap is deceler as it move into it IPO.It' not just the notion that most social network and messag user have alreadi made their choic that bode poorli for Snap, however. There' also the nag realiti that the strength of Snapchat' advertis model is still an unknown quality. Some of what we do know, however, isn't encouraging.Cas in point: In November, AdAg report that the averag video ad shown via Snapchat wa view less than three second befor that viewer skip past it. That' not enough to pay off for an advertiser.Oh,and let' not forget that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergonc offer to acquir Snapchat for $3 billion. When Snap' chief said no,Zuck boughtInstagraminstead, and is now use it to club Snapchat into submission.Snapchat' growth pace wa almost cut in halfaft Instagram' ""Stories"" - compar to Snapchat' ""Story"" - wa launched.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman' $150 TargetAnd if the recent rise of Facebook stock is ani indication, the market agre Snapchat just isn't go to play the role of David to the Goliath that Facebook is. FB stock is up 16% sinc the end of 2016 against a backdrop of Snap buzz.Bottom Line for FB StockCal a spade a spade, Snapchat is a wannabe, jump into the messag fray when the premis of messag wa hot even if the busi model wasn't proven. As is so often the case, though, the wannab simpli can't dethron the entrench powerhouse.That' not to say owner of FB stock have noth to worri about.Chief Financi Offic David Wehner recent acknowledged, ""We continu to expect ad revenu growth rate will come down meaning (in 2017)."" It is to say, though, the establish cash cow can easili fend off Snapchat.Th Snap IPO isn't as much a fundrais to arm the compani as it is an exit strategi for it insid who didn't want to sell to Facebook five year ago.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceCan the Snapchat IPO Show Investor the Money?7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 20185 Incom Tax Deduct You Can't Afford to MissTh postWhi Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holder Shouldn't Sweat Snapchatappear first onInvestorPlace."

Apple's iPhone Loses the China Sales Crown: 3 Reasons It Doesn't Matter,2/12/2017,"Cue the blare headlin about howApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon is doom in China.L last month, Counterpoint Research state that the best-sel smartphon of 2016 in China wasnot an iPhone. The last time an iPhon didn't hold the top spot wa 2012. Last week, IDC pile on, report that the iPhon continu to lose market share in China last quarter, post a double-digit sale decline.Vari pundit have highlight these recent reports, claim that they show Appl is in troubl in China. However, the declin in iPhon sale last year wa neither shock nor alarm -- and Appl is like to return to strong growth in China later thi year.makeArticleAd();iPhon sale declin significantli in China in 2016. Imag source: Apple.Th prolifer of model dilut salesOn big reason an iPhon wasn't the top-sel phone in China last year is that Appl is sell more model there than ever before. A few year ago, two or at most three iPhon would have account for virtual all of the iPhon sold in China in a given year. By contrast, Appl sold at least eight differ iPhon at variou point dure 2016.Thi prolifer of model is mainli an outgrowth of Apple' decis to start build 4.7- and 5.5-inch version of each year' flagship iPhone. Additionally, Apple' Septemb releas schedul for new iPhon mean that it shipment in each year are split between multipl models.Indeed, Appl ship 44.9 million iPhon in China last year, accord to IDC. Yet it ship onli around 12 million unit of the iPhon 6s, it best-sel model of 2016. Two or three year ago it would have been unthink that the top-sel iPhon account for less than 30% of total iPhon shipment in China.Revenu ha alreadi stabil in Mainland ChinaLast quarter, Appl report that it revenu in the Greater China region fell 12% year over year. That would seem to line up with the recent IDC report, which found that iPhon shipment were down 12.8% year over year in China dure the quarter.iPhon sale in China are alreadi start to stabilize. Imag source: Apple.However, on Apple' earn call, CEO Tim Cook state that within Mainland China, revenu wa flat last quarter. The big declin mainli came from Hong Kong. Furthermore, on a constant-curr basis, Apple' sale in Mainland China increas 6% year over year.Ris sale for the iPad, Mac, and Apple' servic busi drove thi solid performance. However, given that iPhon sale dwarf all of these other product line combined, it' possibl that iPhon shipment didn't fall as much as the preliminari IDC estim indicated.Th next-gen iPhon could be a smash successThes first two issu suggest that pundit may be exagger the sever of last year' iPhon sale declin in China to some extent. Nevertheless, it' indisput that iPhon sale fell. The bigger problem with these analys is that they ignor the strong cyclic trend in iPhon sale that ha emerg in China in recent years.Up until 2014 or thereabouts, Apple' growth in China wa mainli driven by the growth of the middl class and the addit of new iPhon carrier partners. Revenu in Greater China surg 78% in fiscal 2012 as Appl began sell the iPhon throughChina Telecom, which nearli doubl it address market in China.Revenu growth in Greater China slow to 13% in fiscal 2013 and 17% in fiscal 2014. The uptick in growth in fiscal 2014 wa surprisingli small, given that Appl addedChina Mobile-- with it nearli 800 million subscrib -- as a carrier partner dure that year.Th problem wa that the iPhon 5s look almost ident to the prior-gener iPhon 5. Sinc iPhon function as statu symbol in China, most potenti buyer want one thatlook distinct from older models. They got that with the iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plus, which both were significantli larger than ani of Apple' previou iPhon models. Thi help Appl grow it revenu in Greater China by 84% -- nearli $27 billion -- in fiscal 2015.Bi contrast, the iPhon 6s and iPhon 6s Plu look veri much like their predecessors. (The main draw wa the addit of a ""rose gold"" color option.) The iPhon 7 didn't do much to distinguish itself from older models, either. It, too, had a new color option -- jet black -- and the larger iPhon 7 Plu model ha a dual-len camera, but otherwis it look quit similar to the two-year-old iPhon 6 design.But Appl is like to introduc a radic redesign iPhon later thi year. Do so will give Chines consum the distinct iPhon they want. As a result, iPhon sale are like to return to strong growth in China in late 2017 or 2018, depend on availability.Sluggish iPhon sale in China aren't an indic that Appl is in trouble. The extrem prefer for distinct new model virtual ensur a ""two step forward and one step back"" growth pattern in China. Apple' next leap forward could be less than a year away.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation Expects to Grow Client Computing Group Profit Margin,2/12/2017,"A littl while back, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) merg it PC client group busi with it mobil group to form it client comput group. CCG is Intel' largest busi by revenue, gener nearli $33 billion in sale dure 2016.Most of that revenu come from sale of processor and relat compon into personal-comput systems, although the compani ha seen reason success from the sale of chip that power cabl gateway and, more recently, cellular modem chip intoApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone.Navin Shenoy, gener manag of the company' client comput group. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();At Intel' Feb. 9 analyst day, compani manag went over it financi expect for thi segment for 2017 -- and beyond. Let' take a closer look.Next year' expectationsIntel say it expect CCG revenu dure 2017 to drop by a mid-single-digit percentage, which I take to mean between 5% and 7%. It' worth note that the chipmak had origin expect flat-to-low single-digit revenu growth for thi segment in 2016 when it provid a preliminari forecast at the end of 2015, and then it revis it guidanc down dure the year to call for a revenu decline, but it ultim end up see CCG revenu grow by 2% for the year.Th company' revenu forecast appear to be in line with it overal personal-comput industri unit forecast, which the compani acknowledg is lower than what some of the estim from third-parti analyst have published.What thi suggest is that Intel is not onli take what it refer to as a ""cautiou outlook"" on the total address market within the personal-comput market, but that it also doesn't expect a repeat of last year' averag sell price perform in which it saw it processor averag sell price rise, help to offset the industrywid unit decline.A far as CCG profit goes, Intel say it aim to see CCG oper margin outperform CCG revenu growth. Or, put anoth way, it expect operating-margin growth.How Intel will grow CCG oper margin longer termIn a previou column, I went over whi Intel expect it profit margin in it fast-grow data-cent group (DCG) todefl in the come years.Two of the driver expect to hurt DCG' oper margin go forward -- name adopt newer, more expens manufactur technolog befor CCG doe and take on a larger part of the company' share oper expens -- should serv as tailwind to CCG oper margin go forward.First, if Intel is alloc more of it share oper expens to DCG and away from CCG, then thi should have the effect of lower CCG' oper expenses. Lower oper expenses, all els be equal, mean that more of each dollar of revenu get turn into oper profit -- in other words, higher oper margin.Next, if Intel' personal-comput processor will adopt new manufactur technolog onli after DCG ha had the opportun to break them in, then CCG should get the benefit of higher manufactur yield for newer products. Higher yield mean a lower effect cost per chip, which for a given sell price mean higher gross profit margin. Higher gross profit margin, assum fix oper expenses, mean higher oper margin.CCG is a cash machine, not a growth engineIt' clear that Intel is now run it personal-comput chip busi for maximum profitability, not for growth.Now, thi doesn't mean the chipmak can just halt all invest in futur product or even get complac -- Intel can't maintain it profit engin here if it build bad product or even build good product but market them ineffectively.But what it doe mean is that CCG is go to have to be more care with each of it research and develop dollars, and it' probabl onli go to adopt new manufactur technolog for veri high-volum product onc the cost of those new technolog ha come down considerably.CCG is still go to be extrem import for Intel over the long term, but that import will -- if Intel is success -- continu to diminish in the year ahead.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in February,2/12/2017,"Warren Buffett will like go down in histori as the greatest investor of all time. Start with a rel small sum while work out of hi Nebraska home in the 1960s, hi person fortun is now estim at $73 billion. If you'r tri to get ahead in the stock market, there' noth wrong with tri to mimic Buffett' blueprint for success: Invest in wide-moat compani that have an easy-to-understand business, and throw off ton of free cash flow.Buffett no longer make all of the invest decis atBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.B) -- he ha turn some of those duti over to hi younger deputies. But if we look at what Berkshir owns, we can choos from the list to see which are good buy thi February. Below, I'll share three that stick out.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Buffett can't ignor the cash thi compani is throw offIt' highli like that Buffett wasn't behind Berkshire' invest inApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , but he' nonetheless probabl veri pleas with it. The Cupertino giant announc earn last month that highlight just how strong the compani ha become.Fellow Fool have alreadycoveredwhat a big hit the iPhon 7 Plu was, but sinc thi is about Buffett, let' cover the factor that he would like focu on.For starters, the compani now ha almost a quarter-trilliondollar on it balanc sheet. That' mind-boggling. But it doesn't end there: The compani ha spit out $53 billion in free cash flow over the past year alone, and it ha onli need to use 23% of that to pay it dividend. Current yield 1.8% today, there' clearli lot of room for that to grow.But perhap most importantly, the stock is still much cheaper than the market. It trade for 16 time trail earn and just 13 time free cash flow.Thi big dividend is look pretti good right nowInvestor are nervou that global car buy ha hit a peak. The cycl is turning, they believe, and we'r about to see a contract in car sale both domest and abroad. That help explain whyGener Motors(NYSE: GM) is so cheap right now. But Buffett like appreci just how high the barrier to entri are in the auto industry, as thi make the moat surround the compani formidable.Th compani came out with earn thi month thatconfirmedsom suspicions: Sale climb just 1.2% dure 2016, and the compani wa unabl to turn a profit in either Europ or South America.Imag source: GMC.But thi compani is much more disciplin than it defunct predecessor: Cost control are much tighter -- with the compani choos to slow down product in the face of wane demand. That disciplin mean the compani should be abl to weather ani downturn and emerg much stronger.Currently, GM trade for a measli six time earn and seven time free cash flow. At the same time, the compani brought in $7 billion in free cash flow over the past year and use just one-third of that cash on it dividend. With that dividend current yield 4.2%, the reinvest that will accumul over time will add significantli to Buffett' -- and your -- returns.We'v onli scratch the surfac of non-cash paymentsFinally, we haveVisa(NYSE: V) , part of the global duopoli of non-cash payments. Like the others, the behemoth came out with earn recent that demonstr just how strong the company' moat realli is. As more vendor accept Visa worldwide, shopper are incentiv to use the card.

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Definitely Want to Consider,2/11/2017,"Mani high-yielddividend stocksar now trade at a premium to the market and their industri peers, due to the multi-year bull market and low interest rate inflat demand for incom stocks. But with interest rate set to rise thi year, investor should be wari of dividend stock that have histor low yield and histor high valuations.It might seem tough to find undervalu stock with high yield in thi frothi market. So in thi article, I'll highlight three stock that still trade at discount to their industri peer while offer yield higher than 3% --Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) ,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) , andChina Mobile(NYSE: CHL) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();QualcommShar of Qualcomm, the biggest mobil chipmak in the world, have fallen nearli 20% sinc the begin of 2017 due to an FTC lawsuit regard the company' licens practices,sever relat lawsuitsfrom longtim customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , and mix first quarter earnings.Th main bear case against Qualcomm is that it core busi model -- which use a high-margin portfolio of patent to support it lower-margin chip busi -- could be crippl if it' forc to lower it licens fees, which mani OEM and regul claim are too high. Qualcomm' chip busi would continu lose market share to cheaper chipmak likeMediaTekand first-parti chipmak like Appl andHuawei. To top it off, the probe and lawsuit could derail it propos takeov ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automot chipmak in the world.Meanwhile, the bull believ that a Republican-l FTC will drop the case, Qualcomm will eventu reach a settlement with Apple, and the NXP deal can still clear it regulatori hurdles.Regardless of the outcome, the steep sell-off ha made Qualcomm share fundament cheap at 14 time earn -- which is much lower than it industri averag of 22. Qualcomm ha hike it dividend annual for 14 straight years, and current pay a forward yield of 4% -- which is comfort support by it payout ratio of 63%.VerizonShar of Verizon have slip 10% sinc the begin of the year, due to a mix first quarter earn report, a (recent dropped) FCC probe of it zero-r strategies, and uncertainti regard it plan acquisit of Yahoo' internet busi and rumor interest in Charter Communications. All those question mark made Verizon look riskier than it primari rivalAT&T(NYSE: T) , which dip just 3% thi year.But that fear also made Verizon a valu play at 14 time earnings, which compar favor to AT&T' P/E of 17 and the industri averag of 25 for domest telcos. The compani ha also rais it dividend annual for a decade, and current pay a forward yield of 4.8% -- which match AT&T' yield. Verizon' payout ratio of 66% also give it plenti of room for dividend hike in the future.Regardless of question surround Verizon' near-term moves, the telco remain the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., and won't like lose that titl anytim soon. Analyst expect Verizon' revenu and earn growth to remain nearli flat thi year, but the company' low valuation, high yield, wide moat, and expand digit ecosystem still make it an ideal incom play for conserv investors.China MobileInvestor look for an oversea domest telco might consid buy China Mobile, thebiggest wireless carrierin China (and the whole world). The carrier had 849 million custom at the end of 2016, and a larg number of it 2G and 3G user upgrad to higher revenu 4G plan throughout the year. It also ha a small but grow wirelin busi with 79 million customers, which could eventu enabl it to launch more comprehens digit bundl like AT&T and Verizon.China Mobil is one of three state-own telco in China. The Chines govern sometim rotat it manag with that of it two peer --China TelecomandChina Unicom-- to ensur healthi competit between the three players. Thi prevent China Mobil from ever becom a monopoly, but it give it a comfort safeti net which limit it downsid dure market declines.China Mobil ha a trail yield of 3.1%, which is support by a payout ratio of 42%. It forward yield is uncertain, sinc it adjust the payment everi year base on it earnings, but it yield ha stay between 3% to 5% over the past five years. It semi-annu yield might not appeal to incom investor look for quarterli payments, but China Mobile' trail P/E of 15 make it a solid valu play compar to other foreign telcos, which have an industri averag of 18.The key takeawayQualcomm, Verizon, and China Mobil all have wide moats, low valuations, and high dividends. Their near-term growth might seem glacial, but I believ that they all have less downsid potenti than other incom plays, which are trade at premium to the market -- which make them solid long-term play at current prices.10 stock we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thi is that whole ""ship leak from the top"" bit that Steve Job alway refer to.Everi few months, Cook weigh in on the debate, either when ask on an earn confer call or dure a media interview. While Cook ha never been a product visionari type, even by hi own admission, hi rational for whi AR ha more potenti than virtual realiti (VR) make an aw lot of sense, given Apple' never-end pursuit of technolog that have mainstream appeal.Tim Cook hold the billionth iPhone.

Among other topics, Cook discuss whi AR is the way to go.""AR allow individu to be present in the world""Perhap the most off-put aspect of VR for the averag consum is the fact that user must don a headset to fulli immers themselv into a virtual world. Even befor discuss the technic requir or cost associ with a VR headset, it' fundament isolating. In contrast, AR sit on top of the real world as an overlay without the isolation.I'm excit about Augment Realiti becaus unlik Virtual Realiti which close the world out, AR allow individu to be present in the world but hope allow an improv on what' happen presently. Most peopl don't want to lock themselv out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that becaus you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engross in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That ha resonance.Cook continu that he see the opportun in AR as analog to the smartphone, believ that it can be for ""everyone."" AR still isn't there quit yet, and need to improv until it ""good enough for the mainstream,"" accord to the chief executive.How and when?Cook' comment are but the latest in the ongo debat over AR' future. In 2016, Cook discuss AR three consecut month in a row:Th Washington Postin August,ABC Newsin September, andBuzzFe Newsin October. It' obvious been on hi mind quit a bit.At thi point, the two most import question are how Appl will implement it -- a separ AR headset or integr into the iPhon camera system, or both -- and when Appl will offici releas it AR offering. If Appl goe the rout of first integr AR into the iPhone, which would larg be software-based, it could reduc the likelihood of leaks. In contrast, if Appl want to jump straight to an AR headset, it suppli chain will inevit leak as prototyp are manufactur and there will be more physic evid of it aspirations.Hop sooner rather than later, Appl will unveil it next ""big idea.""10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It Can Get Worse for Qualcomm: Legal Blitz Threatens NXP Semiconductor Acquisition,2/10/2017,"It' been a rough start to the year for semiconductor giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) . After put what mani hope were the worst of it legal troubl behind it, Qualcomm' share have plummet so far thi year, as sever new legal entangl place continu pressur on the company' patent licens segment.Thes legal troubl could neg affect the chipmak in a number of ways. Particularli worrisome, though, is that at least one analyst ha express concern that it courtroom battl could hamper Qualcomm' pend acquisit ofNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) .makeArticleAd();QCOMdata byYChartsInsid Qualcomm' legal troublesHav unfold in sever stage around the world, Qualcomm' five-year legal ordeal can be broken down into five major points. Each suit ha focus on the company' Qualcomm technolog licens (QTL) segment, which produc roughli two-third of the chipmaker' annual pre-tax profits.In 2013, the Chines govern launch an antitrust investig into Qualcomm' patent licens practices, which led Qualcomm to pay a $975 million fine to Chines regul earli last year. As part of it settlement, Qualcomm agre to lower the per-devic royalti rate it charg Chines mobile-devic OEMs. Collect royalti payment for it standard-essenti 3G and 4G patents, which typic rang from 3.25% to 5% of a mobil device' wholesal price befor potenti rebat savings, ha been a headach for Qualcomm in China. Mani Chines OEM either simpli didn't pay Qualcomm or allegedli underreport their royalti payment to the company, so mani had hope that resolv it Chines legal issu would repres the conclus of Qualcomm' legal woes. As it turn out, those problem were just the beginning.In late 2015, the EU initi a similar antitrust investig into potenti anti-competit practic by Qualcomm. The European Commission, the EU' regulatori watchdog, ha yet to reach a verdict against Qualcomm. Mani expect the EU to render it findings, includ potenti fines, at some point thi year.Then late last year, South Korean regul fine Qualcomm $854 million on similar antitrust grounds. Qualcomm is current appeal thi decision.Finally, Qualcomm wa hit with two more blockbust lawsuit in late January. Thefirst suitcam from the Feder Trade Commission, claim that Qualcomm use it competit posit to gain unfair advantag in the baseband chip market. Three day later,Apple, one of Qualcomm' largest customers, file a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, alleg that the chipmak engag in a number of anticompetit tactics. The charg make for someugli reading.Qualcomm is fight each of it suit and ha respond with some compel arguments. It doesn't make sens to specul about possibl verdict at thi point, though some analyst say the company' mount legal woe could delay or even jeopard it pend NXP Semiconductor acquisition, an outcom that would damag Qualcomm' long-term growth trajectory.Imag source: QualcommWil the lawsuit affect the NXP buyout?Few analyst seem to believ that Qualcomm' patent licens lawsuit alon could compel regul to block the NXP acquisition. The import issu here is that Qualcomm' current product don't compet in the same area of the semiconductor market as NXP.However, it appear Qualcomm' grow number of legal entangl could slow the merger approv process, especi in market such as the EU, where Qualcomm is current battl antitrust charges. In fact, one sell-sid analyst recent downgrad Qualcomm share on the assumpt that the NXP deal will inde now take longer than expect to close, in which case NXP' growth will take longer to have a posit impact on Qualcomm' financi performance.Equ important, extend the time for the deal to close also increas the odd that an unforeseen event could affect the acquisition. What if Apple' suit fundament alter QTL' licens practices? Could that affect Qualcomm' abil to financ the $39 billion deal? Perhaps. Could Apple' lawsuit embolden other major custom -- say,Samsung-- to file a similar complaint? If so, what would that mean? What if anoth countri file yet anoth antitrust charg against it?Th point is that even a delay leav the door open for some other outsid factor to come along and derail Qualcomm' critic NXP purchase. Again, such a scenario appear unlikely. However, given NXP' place as Qualcomm' entri point to the Internet of Thing market, ani potenti overhang that could threaten the deal becom a must-watch item for it investors.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:On of the thing that I wa happiest about, and I think mayb thi is one of the thing that also push the stock up as much as it did after the report, was, look forward, manag guid that revenu should come in somewher between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the next quarter. And thi would be a 1.7% to 5.7% increas over where they were a year ago. I think the reason you have to be realli psych about thi as an investor is, they'r show growth year over year in a quarter that isn't fiscal Q1, where they are typic do blockbust sale becaus of the holidays. So, it seem like we are not onli back to growth thi quarter, but go to at least continu moder growth for the next coupl quarters, if all thing hold.Evan Niu:Yeah. And anoth thing that' pretti impress about the guidanc for thi come quarter, the current quarter, is they'r also leav some room for some gross margin upside, in term of the guidance. The last quarter, there wa 38.5 [percent], and their current guidanc is 38-39 [percent]. What' most impress about that is, most of the time, when you'r come off the big fourth-quart holiday season, you lose some oper leverage, so you'r margin usual come down slightli becaus of the seasonality. For revenu to be come down from season factor to thi 51.5-53.5 level and still be abl to potenti put up a sequenti increas in gross margin, that' pretti strong. I think the biggest factor that' contribut to volatil is all the currenc stuff. But, if they could increas gross margin on a sequenti basi after lose leverage, it' pretti good. That' impressive.Lewis:Yeah. Strong business, fire on all cylinders. Nice to see them back in a growth phase. Anyth els that realli came out to you in the report, Evan?Niu:No. It wa just realli broad-based. They just hit these numbers, small littl records, but all across the business. As an investor myself, it' pretti encouraging. There is thi percept that Appl is at the end of the road, they'r run out of ideas, they'r peaking. And they'r just like, ""Hey, no, we can still squeez out these gain if we realli push and hit on all these side of the business.""Lewis:And that' work with a top-of-the-lin smartphon that realli isn't all that differ than the previou versions. I mean, thi wasn't a crazi updat to form factor, asid from, maybe, get rid of the headphon jack and updat the camera. The phone still resembl what peopl expect of the iPhone. So, you think about what that might mean, were they to make some realli seriou updat in functionality, or do someth radic with futur version of the phone. I think you have to like what that would do for the business.Niu:Yeah. I thought it wa the least impress updat in years. But, here we go. [laughs]Lewis:Clearli 70 [million] peopl disagre with you.

7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV,2/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBack when I wa a kid, a half-centuri ago, most peopl saw onli three TV network - CBS, NBC and ABC.makeArticleAd();Source:Flash.pro via Flickr (modified)If you'r old enough to rememb the DuMont network, pleas check outmi recent galleri on dividend stocksthat provid solid retir income. If you think ofTwenty-First Centuri Fox Inc(NASDAQ:FOXA) as the fourth network, read on.A quarter-centuri ago, when my children were small, a host of cabl network rose to challeng the broadcast network for viewers. It wa the age of""57 channel and noth on""with ESPN, the USA Network, CNN, the Weather Channel and the Food Network all have their heyday.Ov time, the broadcast bought out most of the new operators, sometim after be bought themselves.CB Corporation(NYSE:CBS) now own Showtim and the Smithsonian Network.Comcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA), the parent of NBC, own all or part of a dozen networks, includ CNBC, Syfi and USA.Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), the parent of ABC, own ESPN, the biggest franchis of all, and the Disney networks. And Fox, which grew up in thi era, ha clone for nearli all of them.But in the 2010s, a new forc ha arisen to challeng the network owners, a forc they will find difficult to compet with and almost imposs to buy.That forc is stream services, which deliv their show to your TV, over the internet through plug-in dongl rather than set-top box - unless you prefer view on a PC, tablet or phone. These offer all the entertain a TV zombi might ever need, and the servic can cost less than $10 per month, much less than a cabl service. They don't have schedules, so you watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it.Stream through the internet is the futur of TV, and we are just at it dawn. It' still unclear how we will discov shows, how we will interfac with what we want to watch or how much we'll eventu pay for the privileg of watching. But cable, at least as we knew it, is drift away, as broadcast televis previous drift away. It will continu to exist, as broadcast does, just in a smaller, truncat form.What is the futur of live event in the new world? Is TV even go to remain a one-way, passiv medium? We don't know.In addit to be better, and cheaper, for viewers, the new TV environ right now look great for entertain and show producers, who suddenli have a host of new option on where and how to sell their wares, which they'r use to gain new creativ freedom if not new wealth.But the new media landscap is a lot less stabl than the old one and, given the wealth of choic available, it may prove much less lucr for stars, writer and producers.Just a few year into the new era, moreover, it' appar that the new stream compani are big enough to regard the cabl networks' owner as minnows. Thi is not a problem the network can buy their way out of, as they bought out of cable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowYour mission, as an investor, is to examin the new TV stock and decid whether to invest your money in them. And along the way, you will be buy a lot more than TV.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixTh busi model of the new TV era wa creat byNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).A decad ago, Netflix wa a rel small but interest compani that mail DVDs. You paid a monthli fee to hold a few, then got more when you sent them back. It wa a rel simpl busi base on physic media, but it had potential.Bi simpli move that busi model online,us cloud servic and open-sourc technology, Netflix now deliv unlimit amount of content to viewer as a stream, rather than on a disk.Cofound Reed Hast ha transform TV as no one ha sinc Ted Turner. If you bought Netflix when it went public in 2002, your $1 invest is now worth $137.Hasting' second big innovation, which came on the heel of the stream busi model, wa tostart fund hi own programmingrath than just resel exist movi and TV shows. Hi string of hit began withHous of Cards, base on a British mini-series, which by itself made hi monthli $8 per month subscript fee seem a bargain.Netflix offer it sharehold low profit margins, but great growth. Between 2013 and 2016, revenu doubled, from $4.37 billion to $8.83 billion, and profit nearli followed, from 26 cent per share to 43 cents. Along the way, the compani ha increas it debt dramat - it now repres about one-fourth of asset - to pay for it deliveri infrastructur and to obtain new program assets, which it is assum will retain their valu over time. (Your grandkid will watchHous of Cardsth way your kid now watchM*A*S*H.)With a market cap of $62 billion, Netflix could now buy other TV stocks, like CBS. It valu exce that of Fox. ABC and NBC are protect from a Netflix acquisit by deep-pocket parents, Disney and Comcast. HBO, a subscript servic base on cable, will be protect in the same way onc parentTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) is bought byAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T).NFLX retain it valu as an invest becaus ofit intern operations, which by the fourth quarter of 2016 repres around 40% of the total and continu to grow. In the last three month of 2016 alon the compani ad 7.05 million new members, after forecast it would add just 5.2 million. Netflix' growth is accelerating, and it abil to buy must-se program is grow with it.Th problem for Netflix is that the cloud provid on which it success rest have seen what it ha done. They'r on to the trick. A network today isn't necessarili just a provid of content, but the scale infrastructur necessari to provid that content. The owner of cloud network and vast internet network are copi what Netflix does.Thes challeng have more zero in their asset base than those NFLX ha face before. Onc more, Reed Hast is a minnow in a sea of sharks.Everyth about the industri ha changed, but whether Netflix can ride the changes, or whether it will eventu be bought out as Turner was, remain up for debate.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockThereisa price cheaper than Netflix' $8 per month for all-you-can-eat entertain - the noth extra I payAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to access it video as a Prime member.It is true that you can buy Amazon Prime Video, separately,for $8.99 per month. But that' silli sinc the regular price for Prime, which includ free two-day ship on most Amazon items, is $99 per year (about $8.25 per month).Lately, Amazon ha also been outperform Netflix on the award front. In addit to11 Golden Globe nomin thi year alone, there are six Oscar nomin forManchest by the Sea(Amazonpaid $10 million for the distribut rightsa year ago).Frankli there is so much free stuff on Amazon (which I can watch on a big screen with my Fire Stick, a wireless dongl that fit on the side of the TV, connect to the internet via WiFi, and support a host of other servic includ Netflix) that I don't need anyth else. Were it not for live sports, I would kill my cabl in a heartbeat, and as my favorit sport signstream contracts, that motiv is disappear as well.And it' not just TV either. I'm fortun enough to have a wife who hate TV. She read instead. Amazon' Kindl Unlimited, for anoth $99 per year, becam fantast over the last year as more author have sign up and Amazon' algorithm have gotten better at anticip what peopl might want to borrow next from it vast library.Mi son doesn't watch TV either. He' a gamer, and ha been for years. He is constantli talk aboutTwitch, which offer live stream of peopl play video games. I don't get it, but Amazon does. They paid $970 million for Twitchlast March, make them partner with charact such as Bunnyfufu, who stream their gamingon Twitch.Lik most people, I watch veri few cabl channels.

They'r now worth about $800, and they'r a bargain at that price.For the fourth quarter of 2016 Amazon earn $749 million, $1.54 per share, on revenu of$43.741 billion. It is make the turn from a compani invest in front of growth to one that start earn profit regularly. It cloud operation, Amazon Web Services, now bring one-quart of it $3.5 billion in quarterli revenu to the bottom line - and one of it custom is Netflix.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayImagine. Amazon creat infrastructur that let other compani make money, then compet with it custom to make even more money with the same infrastructure. I recent dump share befor earnings, at $832 per share, becaus they had becom such a huge portion of my retir account.I may have to buy them back.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockNetflix may have creat the new busi model and Amazon may have perfect it, but the technolog began atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with Googl and YouTube.On of YouTube' co-found say the idea start afterth Janet Jackson ""wardob malfunction""at the 2004 Super Bowl. They just couldn't find ani video of it, and so ask other to upload it so they could see it. The servic wa an immedi sensation, and Google' purchas of the site for $1.65 billion wa just the beginning.Th busi model wa simple. Peopl upload videos, peopl watch videos. Googl place ad in front of the videos, and share some of the revenu with those who upload the videos. Like Googl itself, it is a free service, although it now ha a paid version call YouTub Red.YouTubedid not make a profit for it parentuntil after Amazon and Netflix got going. It is now estim to be bring in$10 billion per year, grow at 40% per year, with 80% of view outsid the U.S. By 2020 that will mean$27 billionin revenu per year.

She is not onlybuy TV showsand makinga splash at movi festivalsbut aim to take veteran TV host likeConan O'Brien online. (Chelsea Handler ha alreadi move to Netflix.) Daniel is help by continu sale ofChromecast, a TV stream devic which compet with the Appl Fire StickYouTub ha creat it own stars, most of whom are unknown to their parents' generation. The most popular YouTub celebrity, PewDiePie, drew $15 million in incom last year and hadalmost 50 million viewers.Bi take advantag of Google' low-cost infrastructure, YouTub ha carv out a uniqu nich for itself in the new TV universe, one that is subsid it entranc into more ""traditional"" area like YouTub Red subscriptions.Thank to Amazon' purchas of Twitch, TV stock Googl and Amazon are now on a collis cours in the world of stream video. Custom of both will be the big winners, but stockhold should do well, too.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Appl (AAPL)Source:via AppleAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) wa a latecom to TV stream in the cloud.Appl began ramp up spend for it own cloud onli a few year ago,invest $15 billion in 2016 aloneto build a global network of cloud data center and, potentially, a place for itself in the new industry.Th money wa spent mainli to serv exist paid Appl services, like the sale apps, iCloud storag and iTunes, which are nowbigg profit driver than the Macintosh or iPad. CEO Tim Cook said in hi most recent earn call that Appl Servic brought in$7.17 billionin the Decemb quarter alone, which he expect will doubl by 2020.Apple' stream busi is distinguish from that of Googl becaus it consist of paid subscribers, and distinguish from Amazon and Netflix by be primarili fee-for-servic rather than subscript revenue.Whil iPhon sale are stagnating, Appl ha found a new growth engin in services, and built a platform to challeng the other stream players. Appl Music now ha about21%of the music stream market,half that of rivalSpotify, but Spotifi is not profit and struggl to justifi a $8 billion valuation, which at One Infinit Loop is consid seat cushion money.Apple' push into TV stream will be through a new app called, simply,TV, which aim to solv one of the most vex problem for a stream user - decid what to watch next. The Appl TV stream servic itself ha yet to launch, butrumor about it abound. Appl want to get the same 30% revenu cut on TV stream it get on apps, produc a servic that will cost $20-30 per month.Th most persist rumor about Apple' intent regard stream involveHBO Now, a Time Warner servic that cost $15 per month, and which wa Appl exclus for a few month in 2015. Appl ha the financi wherewith to buy HBO as part of Time Warner' merger with AT&T, or to buy a broadcast compani like CB for cash. Appl TV hardwar isus by an estim 11.9%of TV stream customers.Thank to it exist servic businesses, global reach and over $200 billion in cash, Appl ha the freedom to be patient and negoti with right holder befor launch a TV stream service. But it is far more concern with maintain it high margin than with drive traffic, which hurt it in competit with servic whose price start at virtual free, like Google' YouTub and Amazon Prime.It is hard for me to see how Appl can win in stream when it' unwil to bend on margin to win market share, and will to dither aimlessli with exist TV right holder while rival are creat their own show and even new type of experiences.7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendBut that' just my opinion. I bought Appl share befor it 7:1 split in 2014, sold about half, but retain them in my retir account. It' go to be a nice retirement.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: AT&T (T)Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrI got my first glimps of the futur sever year ago, when right to English Premier Leagu game came up for bids.Th winner weren't the tradit networks, public or private. They wereSki TV, a direct broadcast satellit company, andBritish Telecom, the state phone company.Thi wa year befor AT&T said it would buy Time Warnerfor a report $85.4 billion. It wa even year befor AT&T agre to spend$48.5 billion forDirecTV, the direct broadcast satellit business.Th two deal will combin to transform AT&T from a phone compani into a stream player. It will be abl to bundl wireless, satellit and internet subscriptions, and let it custom stream show from DirecTV to their mobil deviceswithout cost.It new stream service, DirecTV Now, carri an introductori price of $35 per month for 60 channel and attractedov 200,000 custom dure the fourth quarterwhich help offset a loss of custom from it more tradit cabl service, U-Verse. It compet ina cord-cut nichealongsideSl TV, own by DirecTV rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), and Playstat Vue, own bySoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE)For the fourth quarter, AT&T report net incom of $2.44 billion, 39 cent per share, on revenu of $41.84 billion. While thi didn't clear the company' 49-cent-per-shar dividend payment dure the quarter, for the year the compani did earn $2.10 per share, beat the $1.93 annual dividend. It' the dividend, a 4.7% yield to today' stock buyer, that you'r buy when you buy AT&T stock. The share themselv are worth littl more than they were in 2007.I switch from Comcast to AT&T for my own TV and internet servic last year, combin it with my exist mobil phone subscription. I now pay the compani about $400 per month for variou services. That' a lot of cash flow. I should probabl buy the stock.AT&T is the most tradit of the new stream players. It earn a place in thi galleri for it sheer size, with annual revenu of $164 billion, and it control of key internet infrastructur in the core of the network and at the edge.AT&T ha move into stream for defens reasons. Internet advoc have critic it for DirecTV Now, which give it own custom free bit that other are charg for, ignor the concept of network neutrality, but the Donald Trump Administr isgiv it a free pass on that.When the acquisit of Time Warner is final - and that look like a better bet with Trump in charg - AT&T will own a big hunk of the tradit cabl universe, includ HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network.Tim Warner agre to be bought, in part, becaus it need cash to compet for program against deep-pocket rival like Netflix, Amazon, Googl and possibl Apple. AT&T bought Time Warner becaus the vertic integr - own the program as well as the network so you write right check to yourself - should allow it to maintain that dividend.Comcast made the marriag of network infrastructur and content work with NBC Universal, mainli by keep it hand off it creativ people. It is still unclear to me whether AT&T will be will to do the same, or whether it will focu on milk a die industri for profits, which ha been it way of do busi sinc I began cover them over three decad ago.That' the onli thing keep me from buy the shares. That and the lack of capit gains.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Facebook (FB)Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is the newest and, base on revenue, the second-smallest of the new stream players, behind onli Netflix.Dur the Decemb quarter Facebookearn $1.41 per shareon $8.81 billion in revenue. Thi make it four time bigger than Netflix by revenue. With a market cap of about $390 billion, it isth sixth most valuabl compani in the country, less than five year after first go public.Facebook got into stream withFacebook Live, a sort of YouTub for streaming, which ha alreadi made news with Hous Democrat stream a sit-in when Republican turn off their camera and with Donald Trump announc a Suprem Court pick on the service.Facebook Live is alreadi get Facebook into troubl with right holders, like the TV network which saw sale of a recent pay-per-view fight in Australia impact when one subscribersimpli held hi phone up to hi TV and stream it. There is even a name for thi kind of thing -""stream ripping.""Facebook is reportedlywork on an app for streaming, which would put it into more direct competit with Appl TV and Google' YouTube. Thi would be a softwar solut that let it piggyback on others' hardware, like Chromecast, Amazon' Fire Stick and Appl TV. In addit to support it streaming, the app would also support 10-minut TV show with commerci insert into them,lik broadcast TV in the 1940s.What make Facebook power in stream is the sheer number of peopl use the servic - nearli 2 billion - and the amount of time they spend with it. The averag global user spend 20 minut per day on the service, andth averag American spend twice that amount of time.Analyst are divid on analogiesfor Facebook' strategi here. Is it Netflix? Is it YouTube?In fact, neither analog is correct. Facebook mainli want to integr video into it exist offering. It is back away frompay publish for streams, and may be back away in the near term as peopl use it unmoder do-it-yourself stream to show themselvescommit violent crimesandeven commit suicide.Al thi remind me of someth I wrote 20 year ago, about telephony. Telephoni is simpli an internet service. Today, video is the same, an internet service. The differ is that video is far more intim than a phone call, easier to make money from and subject to discuss of rights, or right and wrong.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenIntegr video, even stream video, as just one part of a broader comput experi is the road not be taken by anyon but Facebook.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Alibaba (BABA)Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) got into stream in 2015 by buyingYouku Tudou, a Chines version of YouTube,for $4 billion-plus.Alibaba wa late to thi business, but is work hard to make up for lost time.

This 50% Dividend Grower Is Hiding in Plain Sight,2/10/2017,"There are two way to get big dividends: you can buy stock that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stock that consist grow their payouts.A well-balanc portfolio will includ both type of companies, withdividend-growth stocksb the cornerston of a longer-term incom strategy.Still, investor sometim get frustrat with dividend grower becaus to get their outsiz payout growth, you often have to settl for a low current yield. And whi buy a riski asset that yield 1% when you can get a long-term Treasuri that pay 2%?makeArticleAd();Ther are two answer to thi question. The first is that Treasuri aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rate go up, the valu of your Treasuri will go down. If you need to sell earli for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stock will increas their incom over time - someth Treasuri will never do. In fact, if you choos thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your incom skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world' most recogniz and popular brands:Appl (AAPL).If you read about invest in Apple, you almost alway see a focu on iPhon sales, the valu of futur product and so on. Bear note slow iPhon sale growth (or neg sale growth), devic that didn't quit catch on and rise competition. Bull counter that Appl ha a valuabl and uniqu market posit and innov product that captiv consumers.Both argument are realli miss the point.Th main reason to buy Appl is more bore but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let' start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, mean Apple' dividend-payout ratio is a measli 24%. But the realli amaz thing is how the company' cash flow ha explod and continu to rise:FCF Boot UpYes, there' been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF ha alreadi bottom out and is now back on the rise.Th next thing to consid is Apple' oper margin, which is current 27%. Thi is import becaus it mean the compani is so profit that it can continu to pay out dividend at the current payout rate. That oper margin ha fallen slightli in recent years, partli as a result of chang in the smartphon market, but it' still histor high:Appl Remain a Profit MonsterNot that we'v seen Apple' profit margin remain over 25% sinc 2009. Thi is great news for investors, but it also mean Appl ha becom a veri differ compani than it wa in the 1990 and 2000s. It' no longer a burgeon tech firm but an enterpris that reliabl and consist produc cash it can distribut to shareholders. In other words, it' a blue chip stock, not a specul bet.Again, great news for investor - especi those look for income. Ironically, mani dividend-growth investor forget about Apple, or they may alloc a veri small part of their portfolio to the compani out of fear that it' risky.

In thi segment fromIndustri Focus: Tech, the cast discuss how Appl plan to doubl the size of thi busi over the next four years.A full transcript follow the video.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and Appl wasn't one of them! That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:On of the segment that is gain more and more attent from analyst and the market in gener is Apple' servic segment. Thi is the iTun Store, the App Store, Appl Pay, Appl Music, TV App Store, etc. Services, thi time, came in at $7.2 billion, which is roughli 9% of revenue. But, perhap more impressively, it wa up 18% year over year. It seem like the compani and the Street are both give thi a littl bit more emphasi as time goe on.Evan Niu:Yeah. And that wa a quarterli record, one of those record they set thi quarter. If you look at it now on a trail 12-month basis, servic ha now cross $25 billion, in term of the size of the business. So thi is a huge busi already. Here' the crazi thing: They'r veri ambiti say they'r hope to doubl the servic busi within four years. That' saying, ""We think we can make thi a $50 billion busi by 2020."" Which is pretti ambitious. As far as how they'll get there, they highlight a coupl things. First of all, now, there are 150 million paid subscript that are be automat billed, recur subscriptions. That includ Apple' servic as well as third-parti services. But that' the total number that is be bill through iTun and the App Store right now. That' a pretti big number. They do expect that to keep growing. That' a pretti big base of regular subscript of variou type of servic that they sell. Transact volum are go up, the instal base is growing. There' realli all these differ aspect of it. They even mention -- thi is kind of surpris -- the iCloud storag busi is grow quit a bit. I would never have thought it would be a growth driver. But, basically, all these differ aspect are realli put up good growth, and combined, they'r realli bullish about thi go forward. It' a pretti ambiti goal there.Lewis:Yeah. Look at the input of what make up that servic revenue, there' momentum on both sides. Not onli is the instal base is get larger -- so, the number of peopl that are actual somehow transact with the servic segment -- they indic in the call that that' increas in the strong doubl digits. Also, the ARPU (averag revenu per user) for each pay custom is increas in the doubl digits. So it' not that one side of that equat is realli crush it and the other one is stagnating. Both side are perform well. And I think that' what you want to see.Niu:Yeah. And they also had mention the music business, which had been declin for quit some time, for mani years. Befor Appl got into the stream side, when it wa all the download busi for music, as peopl shift toward streaming, that busi wa shrinking. Now, we'r back to thi inflect point where music is grow again. If you includ both download and stream -- so both iTun plu Appl Music -- if you combin them, the music busi as a whole is now grow again. That' alway nice to see, particularli as the shift toward stream continues, more and more peopl are will to pay. The industri itself realli like the shift to paid stream versu ad-support streaming. And Appl is a big propon in that transition. That' also anoth good sign. They are realli help the music industri grow as a whole, as well as their cut of the whole music busi grow again.Lewis:And you have to like that, consid that they are, what some peopl might argue, kind of a late entrant into stream music. You alreadi had Spotifi with ten of million of peopl use it, and you might have wonder what adopt might have look like for Appl Music and the stream service. But result seem to be pretti good so far.Dylan Lewisown share of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAown share of Apple. The Motley Fool own share of and recommend Apple.

Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL),2/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTher are two way to get big dividends: you can buy stock that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stock that consist grow their payouts.makeArticleAd();A well-balanc portfolio will includ both type of companies, withdividend-growth stocksb the cornerston of a longer-term incom strategy.Still, investor sometim get frustrat with dividend grower becaus to get their outsiz payout growth, you often have to settl for a low current yield. And whi buy a riski asset that yield 1% when you can get a long-term Treasuri that pay 2%?There are two answer to thi question. The first is that Treasuri aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rate go up, the valu of your Treasuri will go down. If you need to sell earli for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stock will increas their incom over time-someth Treasuri will never do. In fact, if you choos thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your incom skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world' most recogniz and popular brands:Appl Inc.(AAPL).If you read about invest in Apple, you almost alway see a focu on iPhon sales, the valu of futur product and so on. Bear note slow iPhon sale growth (or neg sale growth), devic that didn't quit catch on and rise competition. Bull counter that Appl ha a valuabl and uniqu market posit and innov product that captiv consumers.Both argument are realli miss the point.Th main reason to buy Appl is more bore but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let' start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, mean Apple' dividend-payout ratio is a measli 24%. But the realli amaz thing is how the company' cash flow ha explod and continu to rise:FCF Boot UpYes, there' been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF ha alreadi bottom out and is now back on the rise.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialTh next thing to consid is Apple' oper margin, which is current 27%. Thi is import becaus it mean the compani is so profit that it can continu to pay out dividend at the current payout rate. That oper margin ha fallen slightli in recent years, partli as a result of chang in the smartphon market, but it' still histor high:Appl Remain a Profit MonsterNot that we'v seen Apple' profit margin remain over 25% sinc 2009. Thi is great news for investors, but it also mean Appl ha becom a veri differ compani than it wa in the 1990 and 2000s. It' no longer a burgeon tech firm but an enterpris that reliabl and consist produc cash it can distribut to shareholders. In other words, it' a blue chip stock, not a specul bet.Again, great news for investors-especi those look for income. Ironically, mani dividend-growth investor forget about Apple, or they may alloc a veri small part of their portfolio to the compani out of fear that it' risky. That' a mistake.In the last five year sinc Appl start pay dividends, it payout ha soar 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compar that to some of the most popular and supposedli ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple' dividend growth is a big outperformer:Appl Trounc the RestA you can see,Gener Electr Company(GE), AT&T Inc.(T), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ), Chevron Corporation(CVX), Consolid Edison, Inc.(ED)andExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM)ar all grow their dividend at a slower pace than Apple.Th tech giant also ha a lower P/E ratio than all of these name (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It' time to think differ about Apple; thi is a rel safe dividend stock that is destin to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlin about iPhon sale may caus some volatil in the short term, the company' strong cash gener will reward you with big payout in the long run.Buy Appl Now … Then Add These 6 High YieldersThere' no doubt Appl is a best-in-class dividend-growth stock. But you also need high yield to go with that dividend growth-especi if you'r in or near retirement.Should Bill Gate Sell Hi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock?That' where the 6 reliabl incom gener in our new""No-Withdrawal"" retir portfoliocom in. They throw offrock-solid yield of 6%, 8%, 9% and up.And with an averag yield of 8.0%, thi portfolio willeasili hand you a $40,000 incom stream on a $500,000 nest egg.Each of those payout is back byrock-solid balanc sheetsandsurg cash flows.Lik Apple, these incom powerhous are all cheap now, but I don't expect that to last.Thes no-drama play are perfect for 2017, with the market start to look twitchi after the go-go ""Trump bump.""

I know that four out of Apple' five geograph oper segment set fresh high -- all but Greater China. But, China is realli seen as a huge market opportun in addit to India, for Apple. Do you want to put a littl color out as to what they said in the call?Evan Niu:Yeah. Like you mentioned, more quarterli record in term of all the other geograph segments, which, again, it' all these littl thing that are contribut to thi overal overperformance.

But, Greater China, it ha bounc back quit a bit sequentially. In the third quarter, sale were someth like $8.7 [billion] to $9 billion. So, to realli bounc back to $16 billion, it' shi of their all-tim record, which wa set a year or two ago, around $18 billion, but it is bounc back on a sequenti basis.

You can see in their number that they'v had troubl in the past year as competit intensifi on the ground. But I still think that China is a veri big, promis business.

So Why Not Buy Apple?,2/10/2017,"ByWexboy:W all know the type: Born-again valu investor who still have that new car smell. No longer clueless, but the market hasn't beaten adequ sens (or humility) into them just yet, so they'r still insan overconfident. Which we toler - after all, we were like them onc - then they start expound their new and improv valu invest philosophy, and it all goe downhill. I recal one encounter, some year back, where I struggl to get a word in, let alon offer some kind of realiti check. Finally, my new guru wa forc to paus and final breathe, so I did the onli sensibl thing. I lob thi hand grenade:So whi not buy Apple?Al I got wa a puzzl look. Repeat the question, I then pummel him with a verit laundri list ofApple(AAPL) fundament and ratios. If he wa such a valu expert, sure Appl wa a scream valu buy? Needless to say, I never got much of a reply, but it stop him in hi track and scare him off. Job well done! But the more I thought about it, the more it seem like a valid question for other investor (and even me). And a question to be ask in a spirit of honest inquiry. I mean, let' look at Apple' number today:makeArticleAd();- Net sale have reach $216 billion (a of FY-2016).- Net sale increas by 99% and over 1,000% in last 5 and 10 years, respectively.- Gross margin increas to 39% ($84 billion) in last 10 years.- Oper profit margin more than doubl to 28% ($60 billion) in last 10 years.- Net incom increas by 76% and almost 2,200% in last 5 and 10 years.- EP compound by 16% pa and 38% pa in last 5 and 10 years.- Net cash and invest increas almost 1,400% to $151 billion in last 10 years.- Current share price (a of cob Feb-7th): $131.53- Current market cap: $690 billion- Current Price/Sal ratio: 3.2 times- Ex-net cash and invest Price/Sal ratio: 2.4 times- Current P/E ratio: 15.7 times- Ex-net cash and invest P/E ratio: 12.1 times- Current FCF ratio: 13.2 times- Ex-net cash and invest FCF ratio: 10.1 timesOk, just take a moment and marvel. Even with the share price now approach all-tim high again, sure Apple' still a scream valu buy?So whi not buy Apple?Ev since, I pose thi question to fellow valu investor on a regular basis; but I'm not sure I'v ever receiv a satisfactori reply! As in: 'Yes/No, I bought Apple/I decid not to buy Appl - base on a detail analysis, and the follow specif attributes.' Instead, peopl tend to shrug their shoulders, roll their eyes, flash a rueful grin, and mayb toss out one of the usual objections. I'm sure you can guess a few:- But Apple' market cap is almost $700 billion now!- It' far too well-research and effici price for investor to ever have an edge.- A much cooler/better/cheap brand will sure come along for the kid to buy.- It will inevit hurtl off a cliff into technolog obsolesc and irrelevance.- The micro-cap, sum-of-the-part thesi we discuss is far more interesting.- Steve Job is dead… the company' sure to go off the rail ani day/month/year now.- Look at thebloodi chart- who' go to buy it now, after that rally?Now, befor the fanboy start to lose their minds, thi is where I should reveal thi post is NOT about Apple. No, really.Sorry, fanboys…Studi the long-term chart of ani outstand growth stock, and it' quit obviou most of the object abov are just red herrings. Part of a litani of excus too mani valu investor trot out to justifi hide within their own circl of comfort. Becaus we fear the risk and challeng of the unknown. Instead, we reject (or simpli ignore) entir sector and hundreds/thousand of companies, becaus we'v decid they'r just too large, too expensive, too unpredictable, too uninteresting, to be worthi of consideration.And then we citeBuffett: Alway remain within yourcircl of competence!Except thi rule would impli buy no individu stock - sinc newbi investor should alway choos passiv invest initially, as the most prudent choice. And anyway, Buffett evolv hi invest approach and continu expand hi circl of compet over hi entir career. [Yefei Lu'snew Buffett bookoff good perspective]. Mere mortal should emul such an evolut - not Buffett himself! Unless you plan on be a deca-billionair too - then you can avoid/invest in absolut anyth you fancy.Let' not forget, when Buffett start out, technolog wa a nascent sector - which requir a VC approach - someth he clearli wasn't too comfort with. [But readPhilip Fisheragain: Now, he wa a great ventur capitalist - albeit one who chose to invest in list companies]. And technology-rel hype/promot dure theGo-Go Yearsprob compound thi aversion, which Buffett ration as avoid the sector' obviou unpredictability. Except that never stop him from invest in the like of bank and retail! Which are potenti just as lethal and unpredictable, but obvious they were sector in which he wa actual comfort investing.But in stick religi to hi comfort zone, Buffett also display hi true genius. Hi appar caution is decept - rest assured, he never doubt hi invest ability. Instead, he deliber chose to leverag hi prowess in a new and more aggress way, via the use of long-term, interest-fre insurancefloatanddef taxes. Of course, the potenti risk of take on such signific leverag would ensur he remain laser-focus on invest (primarily) in predict sector and businesses, and obvious inspir hi two main rules:Rul No. 1: Never lose money.Rul No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.Coupl thi with super-human patienc and fifti year later it seem almost inevit Buffett' actual accru an entir uniqu invest record.Wherea we don't have the luxuri of float. And it' 2017: We live in a world where technolog and innov play an ever increas role, for decad now, in all aspect of our economy, workplac and daili lives. And technolog isn't (necessarily) ani more unpredict than biotech/pharma, fashion, media, retail, natur resources, emerging/fronti markets, etc. But it deserv far more focu and studi - sinc it potenti impact on other sectors, in term of innov and disruption, is obvious far greater today (and as we look ahead). [Withautonom trucksnow be test on open highways, it' both astonish and alarm to realizetruck drivingmay still be the most common male occup in the US! (with almost 3 million drivers)].A valu investor who deliber avoid technolog and other such (unpredictable) sector is forego a world of invest opportun - especi now, when an ever increas share of econom value-cr is deriv from technology, not to mention other intang asset and intellectu property. And trap in a low-growth, low-return world (like today - or in due course, as debt and entitl keep escalating), such investor may end up condemn to choos between: i) tradit blue chip/Buffett classic (e.g. food and beverag stocks) which now seem to trade at ever-expand multipl (vs. histor and prospect earn growth), or ii) tradit valu stock which can perhap no longer reli on a rise tide of growth, inflat and anim spirits. Who can afford such risk and opportun cost?But for mani valu investors, we'r far more comfort with the numbers, rather than the stori itself. Which is, potentially, our downfal [And vice versa for growth investors]. The hard asset and cheap metric of your typic valu stock offer the siren song of safety, wherea invest in high quality/growth stock may requir a far more demand leap of faith. Except valu stock are often mire in bad management, bad busi models, bad industri and dread capit alloc - with littl hope of compound their intrins valu - the best we can hope for is a realiz of intrins value.If you'r a human comput who love to re-rank and re-invest in the world' cheapest stock everi day, such an event-driven portfolio may be reward (and the studi do claim valu beat growth), but in the real world how mani investor manag to deliv sustain long-term outperform with such an approach? Mayb a passive, computer-driven portfolio is the better solution, especi when the greatest human comput of them all (i.e. Buffett) ha long sinc abandon such an approach. In the end, valu invest will alway be a marvel valuat tool and framework for investing, but it greatest fail doesn't lie in the stock it green-light for you to buy…It actual lie in the stock it persuad youNOTto buy!I suspect most valu investor will freeli acknowledg thi failing. And embrac the proposit that invest in high quality/growth stock is ultim a far more attract way of compound long-term portfolio valu (particularli on a tax-def basis),IF ONLYit weren't so difficult! Becaus such an invest approach must inevit be driven by qualitative, not quantitative, analysis. And it conflict with have our cake and eat it - we want the best compani and the best prices! In reality, we need to compromis and choos wonder compani at fair prices, not fair compani at wonder prices. Which actual offer a far more compel valu equation, sinc time is the friend of the wonder company, the enemi of the mediocre.And so, pay up is often requir - well, at least from a tradit valu perspect - which, almost inevit need to be justifi via comprehens studi of the compani and it management, it capit allocation, it product and busi model, it industri dynamics, and (most of all) whether it enjoy a significant, sustain and (ideally) an expand competit advantag (i.e. aneconom moat). An exercis which is sure infinit more challeng than assess and rank a bunch of valu metrics. And one which can go horribl wrong - a bust valu thesi may engend some rueful sympathi (wow, who knew manag were such idiots?), but pay up for a high flier just befor it collaps will inevit attract a perfect storm of hindsight and snigger for make such a bone-head invest decision. But then again, nail even a singl multi-bagg growth stock might yield a payoff valu investor can onli ever dream of.Of course, today the answer might not be Apple.

Not onli were the claim resolv faster than mani expert expected, but the cost to the compani will be significantli less than mani expected.3. Appl (+13.5%)In part,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) ralli ha been due to it strong result from the holiday shop season. For the quarter, Apple' revenu of $78.4 billion wa as high as it ha ever been, and the company' earn and revenu both handili exceed expectations.Perhap most importantly, Apple' servic revenu (which includ sale from the App Store, iTunes, Appl Music, Appl Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While thi account for just 9% of the company' results, it is rapidli becom an import revenu stream to the company. Furthermore, Appl expect revenu to continu to climb in the current quarter, and CEO Tim Cook said that the compani is ""excited"" about the product in it pipeline.4. Charter Commun (+12.3%)InChart Communications'(NASDAQ: CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock perform wasn't necessarili due to strong growth or other great busi metrics. Rather, the stock spike in mid-Januari on rumor thatVerizon(NYSE: VZ) wa consid an acquisit of the company.

Pandora (P) Earnings: Fourth Quarter Loss Widens,2/10/2017,"Like a broken record that skips, investor continu to ask when Pandora (P) will ever make money?Th company’ inabl to prove it busi model can be lucr ha cost investor ton of money over the past three years, dure which Pandora stock ha fallen more than 65%. On Thursday it wa the same old song. Share of the internet music giant declin as much as 4% in after hour trade session after the compani report a wider loss in the fourth quarter, driven by higher expenses.In the three month that end December, the Oakland-bas compani report a loss of $90 million, or 38 cent per share. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gains, cost and stock option expens and pretax expenses, the loss wa 13 cent per share, which beat Wall Street estim by 8 cents. Fourth quarter revenu came to $392.6 million, up about 17% year over year and also top Street forecasts.makeArticleAd();""W made signific progress in 2016 by drive leverag in our core busi while acceler subscript to our paid product,"" said CEO Tim Westergren, in a statement. Ad that the compani is now ""laser-focused"" on grow ad-support busi and launch subscript product and an artist-to-fan platform.Pandora, which ha been subject to frequent acquisit rumor link it to Appl (AAPL) and Siriu XM (SIRI), ha struggl to grow profit sinc the bulk of it user don’t pay anything. To diversifi the business, which ha been bog down by music licens fees, the compani recent launch Pandora Plu and Pandora Premium subscript services.Still, the fact that the lion share of it revenu (about 80%) still come from advertising, not subscriptions, Pandora still ha a long way to go. And despit be a smaller segment of the business, Subscript onli brought in under $60 million, climb just 5% year over year. This, too, suggest that Pandora is struggl to compet on the premium side with market leader Spotifi and Apple.Al told, these number — on their own — aren’t as bad as the stock’ declin might suggest. The fact that Pandora report a smaller loss than what analyst expect show that the company, which ha promis to cut 7% of it US workforce, is rein in on costs. As to whi the stock is down despit the earn and revenu beat?Thi wa like a “sell the news” type of event.

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important,2/10/2017,"Nvidia earn (Shutterstock photo)It appear the onli thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climb higher are investors’ expectations. Thank to the company’ advanc in cutting-edg technolog such as deep learn and artifici intellig (AI), NVDA share have soar some 340% over the past year, crush everi import index.A such, the California-bas semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-lin number that cruis by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answer the call. But the share appear muted, fall as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantag point, thi decline, which I consid inconsequential, is victori for Nvidia and it investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’ go though the numbers.In the three month that end December, Nvidia report net a incom of $655 million, or 99 cent per share. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, earn came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensu estim by a whop 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenu also beat, come in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street wa look for revenu of $2.11 billion.Th strong bottom-lin beat wa driven by record quarterli GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the compani said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When look back at fiscal 2016, the compani broke sever of it own records, includ full-year revenu of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""W had a great finish to a record year, with continu strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU comput platform is enjoy rapid adopt in artifici intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonom vehicles. Huang also ad that Nvidia’ deep learn GPU (graphic process units) ha made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in earli cancer detection, weather predict and is help to tackl challeng such as self-driv cars.Al told, it is these breakthrough area that continu to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believ until now. And while the tech battl ha alway been between Appl (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guy are not alon anymore.In term of the 3% declin on these solid numbers? Nvidia is be shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to declin 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still impli the momentum stori is still in place. And Nvidia’ Q1 outlook for revenu to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estim of $1.88 billion, suggest it see no sign of slow down."

"Despite Generous Capital Returns, Apple Inc. Still Has More Cash Than Ever Before",2/9/2017,"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) oversea cash posit continu to grow at an incred rate, and the possibl of some type of repatri holiday is the highest it ha been in years, thank to the new Trump administration.In thi segment fromIndustri Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewi and senior technolog specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple' cash posit and financi structure.A full transcript follow the video.makeArticleAd();10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and Appl wasn't one of them! That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Speak of their intern segments, I think it might make sens to check in on their cash hoard a littl bit. As of their recent report, Appl is sit on $246 billion in cash. Becaus they do so much busi outsid of the U.S. and becaus of certain current tax regulations, $230 billion of that total, or roughli 94%, is held outsid the U.S. Morgan Stanley analyst Kati Hubertyask [CEO] Tim Cook on the call about what the compani might be think with the current administration, and the possibl of repatri some of that cash. I think that wa a question a lot of peopl want an answer to.Evan Niu:Yeah. That' one of the big thing that the Trump administr is pushing, is thi tax reform, includ a potenti repatri holiday. If they could bring back a lot of that cash, there are certainli a coupl thing they could do with it. Cook didn't realli give a lot of clear guidanc on what he' thinking. But, you could buy some companies. He keep say that Appl is open to realli big acquisit if they fit, if they make sense, all these things. But he' basic not concern about price anymore. You could buy some companies, you could invest in the U.S., you could potenti bring product back. Obviously, that' anoth big thing that Trump is pushing.Anoth thing I would actual like to see is strengthen the balanc sheet. The whole reason they have the $70 billion-plu in debt is becaus it' alway been a way to avoid the repatri taxes. So, if they can repatri at appeal rates, it might also make sens to pay down some of that debt, becaus that way, you can avoid some of the interest expense, and it strengthen your balanc sheet a little. Not that the balanc sheet is weak, by ani stretch of the imagination. It all net out in the end. But, logistically, it would be nice to bring that money back, pay down some debt. Because, if thi is a one-tim deal that they can bring back a ton of money, I would expect them to keep gener ridicul amount of cash overseas, and then they would want to rais more debt, again, to be abl to tap that, in the same way they have been doing, but if they could pay down that debt, that basic give them even more time to keep pursu the same strategy. And if they'r take advantag of a one-tim tax holiday, I think that would make sense, from a corpor financ standpoint.Lewis:Yeah. Even with $70 billion in debt, where they had to repatri a lot of that cash that' held overseas, they still have quit a bit to work with. I think on the call, Huberti specif ask about what merger and acquisit activ to expect, or if they might continu to invest in origin content and program that would make the Appl ecosystem seem a littl bit more appealing. I think becaus she led with that question and had some specif exampl of where cash might go, Cook' respons follow along with that. But, I wa hope we might get some color about an increas in the dividend, or an updat on what the compani wa think with share repurchas where they'd have that extra capit on hand. But, noth there at the moment. Cook wa notori cagey, as always, in hi response.Niu:Yeah. He didn't realli give a lot away there. They usual updat their capit return program everi April. So, next quarter, we will get some insight. They did buy back $11 billion in share thi quarter. Which partial help juic the earnings-per-shar number, which is anoth record, becaus they are abl to retir so mani shares. They retir someth like 62 million share last quarter. That' realli highli accret to that earnings-per-shar figure, even though net incom wa actual down slightli rel to a year ago, in part becaus of foreign exchang headwind and thing of that nature. So, right now, they are up to about $144 billion in cumul repurchases, and the current author is $175 billion. So they still have plenti of room. They onli have one more quarter befor they updat it again. But I would expect them to give anoth updat and increas it again in a coupl months, becaus thi busi creat so much cash that they liter have no idea what to do with it. [laughs] I mean, think about how much money they have given back, and the fact that they still have more money now than they'v ever had before. So, it' like, they'r tri to give thi cash back at thi ridicul rate, but they gener so much of it that it still add on a net basi to their total cash position, even after give back so much over the years. It' mind-boggling.Lewis:And that' with them continu to invest in the future, as well. You hear about some of the differ project that they may or may not be funding, and some of the initi they might be pushing. It' not like they'r sit on their heel here. They'r certainli throw money into see where tech might be going. It' just that, with thi type of money avail to them, you can onli do so much of it with reinvest in the busi and with R&D. I mean, that' the beauti of have a cash cow busi like that.Niu:It' just insan how much they make.Dylan Lewisown share of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAown share of Apple.

One of the product of thi research is voic driven artifici intellig that can connect and drive everyday devic to understand human speech and react accordingly.Th most basic form of voic technolog is a person direct a machin to do routin task such as play a track, read the mail, send autom respons to mail and such thing that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home autom is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appli use in the home can also take voic commands? And sync with each other to decid the desir activ and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhil Microsoft ha mani year of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat ha realli taken voic control platform mainstream. The compani launch it first Echo devic a coupl of year ago and sold more than seven million devic last year. While mani of them were the cheaper Dot, it still put Alexa, Amazon' voic assist into that mani new homes.At thi year' CES, Amazon had a coup as compani rang from FordF, Huawei and LG to a larg number of startup unveil phones, cars, home applianc and other gadget with Alexa integr make Amazon' voic assist that much more useful.And Amazon ha doubl down to develop Alexa' ""skills,"" which are discret voice-bas applic that allow the system to carri out specif task (like order pizza for example).

Thi is realli where they'r make most of their money.Evan Niu:Yeah. They sold anoth record of 78.3 million. The last three consecut quarters, they put up neg growth. So, they put an end to that trend. Of course, thi creat anoth tough comparison for next year, rais the bar for a year from now. But, personally, I wasn't that impress with the iPhon 7 as a product.Lewis:Do you own it?Niu:No. It' the first time in eight year that I haven't upgrad my phone. [laughs]Lewis:I don't own the iPhon 7 either, so don't feel bad. [laughs]Niu:But, liter everi year I'v been upgrading, thi is the first time I'm not, becaus I just didn't think it wa that compelling. But, obvious the market realli does. Part of it is that the 7 Plu is realli the hot seller thi quarter. Appl even acknowledg that they did a poor job predict demand. They alloc less than they should have to the 7 Plu production. There' not realli a killer featur in the iPhon thi year. Arguably, the biggest thing is the dual camera system that is specif for the 7 Plus. So, it seem like a lot of peopl are pick that bigger phone. I think it cost $120 extra now. You can see it in the numbers. They put up realli strong result here.Lewis:Yeah. And I think you realli see that when you look at averag sell price. That grew to $695 in the most recent quarter, up from $619 in the previou quarter. And a lot of that is the 7 Plu model, and consum clearli vote for the better camera, and be will to poni up a littl bit more dough for it.Niu:And/or extra storage, becaus those thing shoot 4K video, and you need a lot of storag to store all that.Lewis:Yeah. absolutely. So, if you put those two number together, the unit and averag sell price, you get roughli $54.5 billion in revenue. So, right now, we'r look at the iPhon segment make up about 70% of revenu for Appl for thi quarter. Higher than it' been in the past, but not necessarili surprising, becaus the iPhon segment wa so massiv popular and so success thi quarter.Niu:Yeah. They were so suppli constrain the entir quarter. They acknowledg that they didn't meet supply-demand balanc until January. So, they were pretti short on inventori throughout the entir quarter.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA I write this,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock trade at about $824 per share. For 2017, analyst consensu estim are that AMZN stock will earn $7.25 per share for the full year. That give Amazon stock an astronom forward price-to-earn ratio of nearli 62x. In comparison, theS&P 500a a whole trade at about 17x next year' earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn other words, AMZN stock trade at a multiplenearli six timesthat of the averag large-cap U.S. stock.Of course, thi isn't a new phenomenon: For years, investor have consid Amazon stock overvalu base on a P/E ratio that ha often been in the tripl digit - and, not all that long ago, negative.Yet AMZN stock seem to defi gravity: Share are up 50% over the past year, 110% over the past three year and a stun 340% over the past five years. The reason is that Amazon isn't a stock that should be valu sole on next year' earnings, or the price investor are pay for those earnings. That' not becaus the market is crazi when it come to AMZN stock and it' not becaus the fundament ""don't matter"". It' becaus Amazon is invest now for growth later - and that' exactli what itshouldb doing.AMZN' Earn Aren't the Onli ThingIt' tempt to think that a stock with a lower P/E ratio is by definit ""cheaper"" than other stocks. Whi would an investor pay 50x, or 100x, a year' earn when he or she could pay 15x, or 10x? Growth certainli matters.7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendIntuitively, an investor understand that 18x earn for a bad busi isn't obvious better than, say, 22x earn for a good business. In fact, it may be worse. But the P/E ratio for Amazon stock seem ridicul on it face. AMZN is alreadi the biggest retail in the world; is it realli go to show so much growth that it' worth pay a 100x P/E? It would have to grow it profit by a factor of five just to get the multipl to 20x, which doesn't sound cheap itself.However, that type of analysi is gener too simplistic. A stock is valu base on the sum ofallit futur cash flow - not just next year's. That' true for AMZN stock, and it' true forMacy' Inc(NYSE:M) stock as well.Th fact that AMZN trade at 62x 2017 earn and M trade at 10x doesn't, in and of itself, prove anything. It seem almost certain that the earn and cash flow attribut to AMZN stock will continu to rise; it seem highli like that Macy' earn will, in contrast, fall. The rate at which those earn rise or declin matters, of course, and those rate inform how investor valu AMZN stock or M stock.But whether a stock is valu at 100x P/E or 3x P/E, investor need to take a long-term outlook. And while it may not appear like it at first glance, that' exactli what mani AMZN stock holder are doing.Th Two Way For Amazon Stock to Grow EarningsEven those investor who are mostli bearish on Amazon stock would like admit that Amazon' earn will continu to grow go forward. But the bearish argument - one that ha been made for the better part of a decad - is that it' almost imposs for AMZN earn to growthat much. After all, as a compani get bigger, it growth rate fades, simpli due to it size. (SeeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for a perfect example.)At some point, the optim that keep Amazon stock at noseble level will fade - and AMZN stock will come back to Earth.But that argument assum that Amazon is at noseble levels, which may not be the case. The heavy-hand P/E ratio sound highli stretched; however, accord to AMZN' most recent 10-Q, it gener $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That impli a sub-50x multipl to free cash flow ona trail basi -a slightli less intimid multiple. And the focu on P/E ratio also ignor that there are two way for Amazon to grow earnings.Th first is the standard way that compani grow earnings: higher sale and better margins. There' littl reason, bar an econom recession, to see AMZN' sale declining. Even then, increas market share could allow Amazon to post revenu growth, if not at the 29% pace seen through the first three quarter of 2016.There' also reason to see AMZN' margin expand considerably. Somewhat incredibly, on a GAAP basis, Amazon' oper margin year-to-d is just 3.2%. Yet the compani ha built out an incred distribut platform and it ha invest billion of dollar in it Amazon Web Servic business. Increment sale thu should boost margin considerably; it take veri littl in the way of invest to sell a few more items, or add anoth cloud customer.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAMZN still ha year of benefit from the scale it ha built out, and those benefit will continu to expand margin for some time, allow for steady, and even explos earn and cash flow growth.Th second issu rel to current and 2017 earn is that Amazon isn't current maxim it profits. Rather, it is spend - sometim wildli - on a varieti of initiatives, offer everyth from restaur deliveri to photo print to Prime Video and Prime Music subscriptions.Som of those effort will work; mani like will fail. But look at 2016 and 2017 earn and not consid the impact of that spend is as short-term as buy AMZN stock in 2017 simpli becaus it rose in 2016. Amazon' oper expens are on pace to increas almost $10 billion year-over-year in 2016. A good chunk of that is come from hire employees, market the new busi and creat the distribut platform for variou projects.Assume, then, that AMZN decid to focu on near-term earnings, instead of invest now for the future. Simpli limit that increas to $5 billion would come close todoublingAmazon' earn and cash flow next year. Ignor that new spend ignor the 'true' earn power of AMZN stock.Bottom Line on AMZN Stock: It' ComplicatedThi is not to say that Amazon stock is necessarili a buy. As a valu investor myself, I still question the valuat of AMZN stock in my own way. But simpli check the P/E ratio for AMZN - or ani other stock - is too simplistic. Tri to valu Amazon stock is a messy, difficult, detail endeavor. The Amazon Web Servic busi is vastli differ from the price-sensitive, low-margin, onlin retail business. It' not clear how much AMZN is spend on it new projects, and how much it could save.It' complicated. But so is invest the right way. And simpli ignor - or short - Amazon stock becaus of it P/E ratio isn't the right way to do it. There are reason to be optimistic, and pessimistic, toward AMZN stock, but those reason go well beyond a singl number.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenTh postAmazon.com Inc.

A Win-Win Trade for Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Bulls,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is look better and better both off and on the AAPL price chart. But follow a massiv rally, a well-posit bull put spread trump buy Appl stock near-term.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrIt ha been almost exactli one month sinc I pen some bullish analysi on AAPL onJan. 10. At the time, there were plenti of potenti headwind for Appl stock. And to be honest, mani of those factors, rang from trade, to China, to a success transit as asoftwar company, could still present issu for Apple.Nevertheless, I didn't mind throw caution to the wind given a dose of contrarianism, a decent Appl stock chart and firm control on risk use an April bull call spread. And I'm glad I did, as Appl stock ha gone on to make it investor veri happi and in more than one way.Back on Jan. 31, Appl manag to delight Wall Street by not onli beat top- and bottom-lin views, but also in the qualiti or tire-kick aspect of the results. There were typic highlights, such as $18 billion in profit for the quarter, 78.3 million iPhon sold and a record cash hoard of $246 billion, whose size is simpli amazing. But thi report wa also much more than that for Appl stock.Th companyshow a return to growthspearhead by execut with it increasingli import Servic busi that includ the App Store, iCloud, iTun and Appl Music.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowAppl also drop hint of a major media acquisition, expand AAPL' reach into smart homes, and, somewher in the dazzl dog-and-poni show, the buzz over thi year' forthcom iPhon 8 iteration.Anoth way the compani ha made it investor veri happi of late ha been on the Appl stock chart.Appl Stock Weekli ChartA month ago, I discuss a bullish cup-and-handl pattern which had just clear the 62% retrac level as Appl stock broke out on it daili price graph. The area is highlight in yellow on the provid weekli stock chart of AAPL.Now, with share up about 11% and focus on the larger time frame, a similar but more substanti correct cup format ha emerg sinc Appl stock hit it all-tim high in 2015.Look forward, there' noth to stop Appl stock from break out of the cup -pattern and essenti forgo the develop of a handl consolid on the AAPL chart. But we'r inclin to think that' not go to happen.In our view, an overbought stochast and lack of an immedi catalyst for AAPL share follow a strong run will like lead to a fail attempt at break out or simpli a bit of price consolid to neutral condit befor a success move into higher ground.AAPL Stock Bullish StrategyLook at the Appl stock option board and given the discuss view, the Weekli 3 March $129/$126 bull put spread is interesting.Pr for 50 cents, the seller of thi put spread is abl to collect the full credit as long as AAPL is abov $129 at expir three week from now. The margin of safeti or downsid buffer is roughli 2.3% with Appl stock trade near $132.05.If AAPL share are abov $129 at expiration, the collect credit amount to a non-annu return of 20%.In the event Appl stock fall and the vertic goe in-the-money, the trader can begin accumul stock for no wors than a price of $128.50. Even better, the trader could possibl get a much lower effect purchas price if AAPL tank through the spread.For instance, if AAPL were to fill the daili chart earn gap and trade down to $121.50 in the next three weeks, through either assign or close the spread and simultan buy stock; the trader is at worst, out $2.50 or roughli 2% of Apple' share price.Rid the Energi Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) Higher With Thi TradeFactor in the loss, if thi trader wish to buy AAPL on the extrem weakness, the initi purchas price would net out to $124 ($121.50 AAPL + $2.50 vertic loss). That compar favor to a trader purchas AAPL today for $132 and a posit that would be out 8.5% on paper.Bottom line, with incom potenti and the opportun to purchas Appl stock with a margin of safeti that includ stronger valu and limit risk, thi bullish AAPL put spread make for a solid altern to simpli buy share right now.Invest account under Christoph Tyler' manag do not current own posit in ani of the secur or their deriv mention in thi article.

1 More Sign That Apple Inc.’s New MacBook Pro Computers Are a Huge Hit,2/9/2017,"Back in Octob of 2016,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) releas much-need refresh of it MacBook Pro product line. Thank to the launch of these new systems, Appl broke the long lose streak that it Mac busi had been seeing, andreported1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughli 7% Mac revenu growth in it most recent quarter, impli a boost in Mac averag sell prices.Although the number clearli speak for themselves, there' one more bit of inform that Appl disclos on it most recent earn call that point to posit custom recept of the company' new MacBook Pro systems.Apple' newest MacBook Pro. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Suppli constraint curb growthAppl CEO Tim Cook said that that Appl wa ""suppli constrain for the new MacBook Pro throughout the Decemb quarter and is just now come into supply/demand balance"" for the systems.Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offer some commentari about the company' Mac channel inventori dynamics, say that the compani ""end the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to five week target rang for Mac channel inventory.""Appl sell mani differ Mac product besid the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar -- includ the older discount MacBook Pro models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though Appl appar end the quarter within it target channel inventori range, channel inventori level of the new MacBook Pro system may have been at lower levels.What' next for the Mac?Appl ha a reason shot of continu to outperform the broader person comput market again, especi if it get back to put out new/refresh system at a regular pace.Next up, I expect Appl to refresh it desktop systems. The one that Appl current ha for sale are now a gener behind in processor technology, so at the veri least, the compani ought to offer model with the latest chips.Th perform boost from the new chip won't be earth-shatt -- generation-on-gener improv in personal-comput perform are hardli dramat these day -- but it' easier to market system with the latest processor than it is to tri to market one with previous-gener processors, especi when the competit ha move to the newer ones.I also expect Appl to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system soon. The current model use older processors, so at the veri least, a processor upgrad is in order. Onc again, thi is not the sort of thing that' go to be fundament game changing, but a better, faster system should be easier to sell.Aft those system are updated, I expect Appl to go back and updat the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect signific chang like the one the compani brought with the one launch back in Octob 2016, but improv processor technology, and perhap a larger battery, could make for a ""good enough"" upgrade.Appl doesn't need to deliv ""revolutionary"" Mac product to the market to do reason well -- the company' brand power, it reput for excel custom support, and perhap even the strength of macO rel to Windows, to some potenti buyer should be enough to allow the compani to at least perform with the market, if not steadili gain share.However, as we saw in the last year, if Appl doesn't regularli refresh it product line, keep it stale in an alreadi mute personal-comput market, then there will be less incent for current Mac owner to upgrade, and it will becom harder to convinc Window user to switch over.For the sake of Apple' Mac business, let' hope that the compani ha plan for annual product refresh to keep thing interesting.Off from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(AAPL) stock enjoy healthi gain in the day follow the company' earn reports, and analystscroon over the results.makeArticleAd();But not everyon wa so thrilled, with some point out the fact that the Decemb quarter had an extra week and other focus on the challeng be seen in the smartphon market.Nonetheless, analyst are as happi as can be and continu to tri to sell investor on the iPhon 8 cycle. At least one analyst ha boost hi price target for AAPL stock base on the record iPhon unit number in the Decemb quarter.AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per ShareCanaccord Genuityanalyst T. Michael Walkley rais hi price target for Appl stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note date Feb. 6. He feel the compani took a ""strong share"" of the premium end of the world' smartphon market dure the Decemb quarter, as it gener 92% of profits.That is a declin from 106% of the profit in the Septemb quarter, however, becauseSAMSUNG ELECTRONIC' (SSNLF) profit improv after the Galaxi Note 7 recall.Appl sold 78.3 million iPhon with an averag sell price of $695 dure it first fiscal quarter as consum prefer the more expens iPhon 7 Plu models. Walkley also believ the iPhon maker benefit from the Note 7 recall-although there wa some debat about that befor the result were released. Appl manag said the quarter had the highest quarterli number of switcher from Android, someth that third-parti data indic just befor the release.Th analyst also expect the iPhon 7 lineup to continu do well, bridg the gap until the iPhon 8 is released, probabl in September.Despit Walkley' (and almost everyon else's) enthusiasm about Appl stock, Neil George, a contributor forTh Street,feel investor are do noth more but attend the ""church of Apple.""Here' How Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200InvestorsdumpedAmazon.con, Inc.(AMZN) stock immedi follow the retailer' earn result (although the share are up today), but they have been happili slurp up Appl stock.H said the iPhon maker ""i face with a dwindl market share and shrink margins,"" which mean it just doesn't make sens to be so enamor with the company.Meanwhile, Amazon record soar revenu and the seventh consecut profit quarter. There' also new data from Slice Intellig indic that the compani hoard 53% of all growth in U.S. onlin sales.Did Appl Take Investor For a Ride?Georg argu that Appl ""pull off a sleight of hand"" by ad the extra week in the Decemb quarter-an argument also made by Thoma H. Kee Jr. onMarketWatch. Accord to Kee, to make up for that extra week, the compani would have had to report about $3.53 per share in earn rather than the $3.38 per share it reported.H also estim that revenu should have been about $81 billion rather than the $78.4 billion that wa reported. Base on hi weekli calculations, the compani grew at a 4.11% slower rate in the most recent Decemb quarter than it did in the same quarter in 2015. Kee argu that Apple' growth rate contract rather than grew in the most recent complet quarter and that it onli look like it did becaus of that extra week.Georg highlight other ""problems"" he see at Appl as well, like the contract gross margin, which fell to 38.5% from 40.1% in the year-ago period. The iPhon maker also saw it sale in China, the world' biggest market, fall 12% in the Decemb quarter, reduc it market share there to 9.6%. He said the company' global market share ha fallen as well, down to 11.5%.Appl is wide expect to launch the tenth anniversari edit of it smartphon under the iPhon 8 moniker, and most firm have been call thi cycl a ""supercycle"" becaus they'r expect tremend growth.However, one analyst that' been call for a supercycl is start to back off from that theori and suggest now that the next cycl will be one of ""smooth"" growth rather than anyth of the ""super"" variety.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialUBSanalyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note date Feb. 7 that he' now ""smoothing"" out hi assumpt for iPhon growth over the next coupl of year and adopt ""less of asupercycleview"" for fiscal 2018."" He note that it should be expect for product cycl in a matur market to becom muted, so he' cut hi iPhon unit growth estim from 16% to 12% for fiscal 2018 and boost hi fiscal 2019 estim from a 2% declin to a 7% increase.Despit thi smooth out, he' still expect the iPhon 8 cycl to bring greater growth than the fiscal 2019 cycle.H feel that it could be more benefici for Appl stock' multipl if the compani experi more gradual growth becaus investor might be encourag to see the company' hardwar and servic revenu combin as an annuity.Shar of AAPLstock rose by as much as 0.19% to $131.78 dure regular trade hour on Wednesday and are trade slightli higher in earli morn trade Thursday.Th postAppl Inc.

The number they put up, I mean, I wa pretti impressed. I wasn't realli expect them to blow it out like this, and beat their own guidanc by $400 million.Lewis:Yeah. We alway do the Appl earn show, it' one of my favorit to do. But after sever in a row where we'v been, like, ""Yeah, we know that growth is slow or even declining, but just be patient, we think it' go to be OK,"" it will be nice to do a show where we can talk about them and have a bit of a rosier outlook on things, and mayb reaffirm some of the confid that the Street should have in the business. In a lot of ways, it' still a fantast company. Whi don't we start out with a big number here? Revenu came in at $78.3 billion, which beat estim of $77.3 billion. Also beat the company' guidance, like you said, by a coupl hundr million. Earn per share came in at $3.36 for the quarter, which also beat estim of $3.22. So, for the first time sinc fiscal Q1 of last year, the compani post year-over-year revenu growth.Niu:Yeah. I think that' one of the big stories. 2016 wa so tough on them in term of storylin and sentiment, because, yeah, first year ever of show neg growth, and everyon is kind of gloomi about it. Then, they come back and say, ""We still have it in us, we can still set records, we can still push all these differ part of the busi to these complet record levels,"" includ the Mac, which is crazy, becaus the Mac ha been around for 40 years, and they'r still continu to grow it and push up higher.Lewis:And they'v been work against so mani headwind for such a long time in that year. You look at the strong dollar have a pretti sizabl impact on the money they make overseas, and also the sell price of devic overseas. You look at the elong of the upgrad cycle, particularli with some of the wireless carrier move away from a subsidi model, and get peopl off of that two-year upgrade.So, there are just a lot of thing push against what would normal caus peopl to be buy phones, or would be allow them to recogn more in revenu and earn here in the U.S. So, it' nice to see them bring it back up thi quarter.Dylan Lewisown share of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAown share of Apple.

"Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …",2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plan to releas it fourth-quart and full-year result to the invest commun after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I'v been slow to warm to Nvidia' invest appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock ha nearli tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh key to the forthcom earn releas will be growth - just like it is for ani company. So far, the earn momentum and increas in analyst project suggest Nvidia' prospect are bright.But will NVDA stock holder have to toler some bump along the way?Nvidia Earn ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in earli December, I suggest keep an eye on earn trends. At that time, full-year earn estim (the averag of the earn all analyst cover the name expect the compani to report) had jump nearli 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It' a key reason NVDA stock ha ralli so strongly.Th current full-year estim for Nvidia earn (accord to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relay that 19 analyst have provid estimates. That' about flat over the past 60 days, but actual down slightli from the $2.45 project 30 day ago.But really, thi is split hairs. It' veri like NVDA report a solid quarter in term of bottom-lin growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowAnd sale growth is project to bestellar. Analyst expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-lin growth is project to slow to 16% for full-year sale of nearli $8 billion; 2018 profit are current peg at $2.71 per share.Th Busi Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earn ratio on NVDA stock sit right below 50. That' a rather lofti multiple, and it essenti mean that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickli surg share price could take a similarli speedi tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia oper in some of the most excit growth area for semiconductors. The compani is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular it graphic process units, or GPUs. The compani boast it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. Thi look accur - a recentBarron'sarticlepeg it GPU market share at 68%. Thi is one of the most compel space in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia' chip are an integr compon in the ecosystem that are pioneer growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machin learning, and self-driv cars. These are some huge disrupt industri that could end up revolution mani facet of the gaming, computing, and automot industries.Th company' game busi is the largest oper unit and grow 30% per year on averag sinc 2013. It data center busi (to support cloud computing) is expand at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automot is skyrocket 75% annually, though from a veri small initi base.In some respects, and provid you are comfort with the lofti valuation, Nvidia is a veri compel way for broad exposur to multipl disrupt industries.NVDA add exposur to the cloud-comput excit that is creat a buzz at giant tech firm includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole posit in the autonom automobil charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 comput platform current power the Tesla auto model that alreadi have self-driv capabilities.Th CompetitionMor direct competitor includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are look to grow in these newer markets. Both key rival are also like to benefit from GPU use to power game systems, machin learning, and server use for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from it domin market share in person computing. It 80% market share to power person comput and relat devic ha liter result in hundr of billion of dollar in cash flow over the past sever decades. Thi give it unmatch rivalri to invest in new technolog and keep a leadership posit over chip competitors. But comput is matur and bare expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Sock the Short With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost it way. Year of mismanag allow Intel to expand on it domin and nearli put AMD out of business. But new manag appear to have reinvigor AMD, and investor are start to believ it can also benefit from the same market Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arec interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni peg semiconductor stock as one of hi favorit industri for 2017. In hi words, ""we'r talk about major secular disrupt in autos, consum electronics, and gaming."" Chip that power data warehous to serv the rise in cloud comput repres yet anoth market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor' best bet to gain exposur to these markets. The rub, of course, is it valuat alreadi reflect mani more year of rapid growth.AMD is an interest turnaround play, though with it current low level of profitability, the trade multipl are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. It forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest take a wait-and-se approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is like to impress, but given the lofti valuation, ani hiccup in the expect could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.A of thi writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Appl Inc. iPhon 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)Th 10 Best Index Fund for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corpor (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appear first onInvestorPlace."

Thi rise compar with the S&P 500' 22% gain dure the same period. Interestingly, the perform of Apple' busi dure thi period hasn't been particularli impressive. So, what drove the stock higher?Bor resultsIn Apple' most recent report trailing-12-month period, result actual look quit dismal.

Further, these aren't the sort of result often associ with 40% rise in a stock price -- especi when refer to a popular tech company.But despit Apple' lacklust perform in the past 12 months, share have climb higher and easili outperform the market.Valu mattersSo if Apple' busi saw both revenu and EP declin in the past 12 report months, whi are share trade higher? While investor could come up with a rang of reasons, one catalyst for the stock dure thi period like stand out the most: Appl stock wa undervalued.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYChartsOn year ago, Appl stock had a mind-boggl low price-to-earn ratio of just 10.

While Apple' higher price-to-earn ratio today of nearli 16 doe a better job of price in a more optimist outlook for the company, investor should keep in mind that the stock' 40% rise dure the past 12 month doesn't automat make Appl stock expens today.

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsDon't let a faulti altimet lead you to believeBo Co(NYSE:BA) is in need of repair. Ani stray measur in Boe stock' share price on Wednesday were tie to a pend dividend payment - and one that ha alreadi paid nice dividend to some option traders. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrShar of Boe have been fli high in 2017 after hit record high follow the aircraft manufacturer' earn beat late last month. But in Wednesday' session, BA stock may have appear to have had a slight crack in it fuselage; pardon the pun.Houston, Boe Ha a Problem?At a share price of $164.08 and depend on your trade vendor, BA stock wa off either $1 or 0.61% or a more eyebrow rais -$2.42 or -1.45%.The $1.42 differ between the two read in Boe share is tie to the stock go ex-dividend Wednesday, with a cash payment of $1.42 schedul for March 3.Bear thi in mind, trade vendor who recogn the ex-dat will show BA stock as trade lower by the less-signific 0.61%. Ani chart or quot platform that erron fail to account for the ex-dat will indic Boe ha declin by a larger 1.45%.For BA stock investor who were long or purchas share by Tuesday' close, Wednesday' minor damag is reflect by the more modest 0.61% dip, as $1.42 will be paid back to sharehold next month to dampen the otherwis larger 1.45% declin in Boeing.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterWhat' the point? Dividend aren't a free lunch, as the money distribut is taken out of the share price of the stock. If Wednesday wasn't an ex-dat in Boeing, BA stock would be trade $1.42 higher at $165.50 vs. $164.08 - bottom-line.For the proverbi free lunch, you'd have to look at Tuesday' heavi volum option trade in BA stock tie to 'dividend play' activity, which look to arbitrag the futur payout with an immedi overnight payoff.BA Stock Dividend Play StrategyTo illustr how thi might be accomplished, we can look at the BA stock Feb $155 call, as roughli $14,200 in profit wa distribut to one or more option trader today due to the ex-dividend.In Tuesday' session, more than 5,600 of the deep in-the-money call traded. The heavi talli compar to open interest at the time of roughli 2,500. With the Februari $155 put trade for 10 cents, part of the unusu volum may have been in the form of trader execut buy-writ or the equival of a synthet short put.But the trader respons for thi activ weren't look to establish buy-writ for 10 cent when buy BA stock and sell the Februari $155 call dure Tuesday' session. Nope.What these BA stock dividend trader were realli after wa hope a long $155 call holder within the pool of exist open interest of 2,500 fail to exercis the contract last night.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improv your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it ha been lethal for investors. Dure the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrend 60%. Thi is certainli anoth case studi of how high-profil IPO can quickli come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a valu play here?A I'v written variou time for InvestorPlace, it' probabl not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a compani that develop a product that realli is not a must-have. Accord to a recent studi fromGartner, the abandon rate on fit tracker is 30%. The most common reason for thi include: user either get bore or the devic breaks!Th conclus from the report: ""Dropout from devic usag is a seriou problem for the industry. The abandon rate is quit high rel to the usag rate. To offer a compel enough valu proposition, the use for wearabl devic need to be distinct from what smartphon typic provide. Wearabl maker need to engag user with incent and gamification.""Th Other Problem for FIT StockBut thi is definit not the onli major issu with Fitbit stock. Let' face it, the competit environ remain intense. The compani must fight against tough rival likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Appl Watch, which is still in the earli phases.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterIn light of all this, is it ani wonder that Wall Street is concern with FIT stock? Of cours not.Mor importantly, the compani is alreadi report major problems, as seen with the latest warn on fourth-quart earnings. Fitbit' guidanc call for a loss of 51 cent to 56 cent a share on revenu of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast wa for earn of 14 cent to 18 cent a share and revenu of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it look like the holiday season turn out to be a disast for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situat isexpect to continue. The full-year predict is for revenu of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cent to 44 cent a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, wa look for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-lin and profit of 64 cent a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT ha a plan that look weak. The compani expect to reduc the workforc by mere 6% and to take other vagu effort to reduc oper costs, leverag data and launch product into new categories. Interest enough, Fitbit want to focu more on the smartwatch market, but thi will like mean more expenses.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO Jame Parksaidthat the issu with the compani were ""temporary"" and the ""perform is not reflect of the valu of our brand, market-lead platform, and company' long-term potential.""Huh? Well, thi realli doe seem like the talk of someon who is out-of-touch. And thi should definit be omin for holder of FIT stock.Granted, perhap there may be a buyout. But when it come to broken hardwar companies, thi may be wish thinking. For example, think about how long the rumor for a purchas of the beleagueredBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be veri interest to a suitor. And thi is not becaus the product are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simpl as that the market ha hit matur level and that big player like AAPL stand to captur a big part of what' available.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbook.

Facebook vs. Apple: Whose Reality Will Win?,2/8/2017,"One of the most promis trend on the horizon that ha arguabl the most transform potenti is virtual/aug realiti (VR/AR). How these technolog emerg and subsequ affect our live remain to be seen, but compani are alreadi place their bet accordingly.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) becam the poster child for VR in one fell swoop in 2014 when it scoop up Oculu for $2 billion. A week ago, Facebook lost a lawsuit regard the acquisit to ZeniMax, which alleg that Oculu stole trade secrets, and a juri award ZeniMax $500 million (ZeniMax wa seek $6 billion). Facebook will appeal, but let' call the total effect cost of acquisit $2.5 billion for now.Onc upon a time,Alphabetwa the poster child for AR with Googl Glass, but that product fail spectacularly.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha emerg as a potenti candid to assum that title, albeit unoffici until it actual unveil an AR offering. We do know that CEO Tim Cook isfar more interestedin AR than VR, believ that it will have broader appeal with mainstream use cases.makeArticleAd();It' still earli innings, but whose vision of realiti will win?VR is harder and will take longerFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg firmli believ that VR will be the next major comput platform that ha the potenti to be a paradigm shift. But it' go to take an aw long time to get there. VR is current a nascent nich of video gaming, and it requir creat entir world to immers user in. That also requir both a lot of softwar develop as well as heavi lift on the technic side, requir high-end game rig that cost $1,000 or more by themselves.Mark Zuckerberg speak at Oculu Connect 2. Imag source: Facebook.Hi Zuck see VR as a richer media format that can creat a divers array of social experiences. He' even envis a distant futur where you can visit a doctor in VR, or hang out with long-dist friend in a VR room (like how hechat with Hugo Barrabefor hire the executive). It will take at least a decade, but Facebook is in it for the long haul. Uncl Zuck is also interest in AR, but it seem that he think AR will come after VR, base on hi comment from last year' F8 conference:Ov the next 10 years, the form factor' just go to keep on get smaller and smaller. And eventu we'r go to have what look like normal-look glass that can do both virtual and augment reality. And augment realiti give you the abil to see the world but also to be abl to overlay digit object on top of that.Earli today,Busi Insiderreport that Facebook wa shut down hundr of it Oculu pop-up demonstr station within big box retailers, note that employe would go day without give a singl demonstr to interest customers. So yeah, it' go to be a while until VR is readi for the mainstream.AR is easier and be here soonerA usual, Appl isn't give ani offici clue as to it strategy, but there have been rumor of the compani test out AR glass and it ha been hire and acqui-hir expert from the field sinc at least 2015.It' much more plausibl that AR will have a more immedi impact. The softwar should be easier to develop and less comput intensive. Imagin the thing you current do on your smartphon be beam in front of you. Or you can even use a smartphon as an AR interface, which mani app alreadi do today.But if Appl were to jump in directli with AR integr in iO and/or a set of AR glasses, that would have the potenti to truli bring AR to the masses, much like the company' track record with bring mani other previous nich technolog to the mainstream. It' also a lot more approach to the averag user.Here' anoth quot from Cook regard AR from September:Mi own view is that augment realiti is the larger of the two, probabl by far, becaus thi give the capabl for both of us to sit and be veri present talk to each other, but also have other thing visual for both of us to see. Mayb it' someth we'r talk about, mayb it' someon els here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there' a lot of realli cool thing there.Cook' point is that VR can be isol sinc you have to wear a larg obtrus headset, which is a bit iron given that Facebook is so interest in a potenti anti-soci experi (at least anti-soci in physic reality).I'm go to side with Appl here and agre that AR ha much more potenti than VR.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM,2/8/2017,"Share ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andIntern Busi Machines(NYSE: IBM) have perform well over the past year, both up about 40% follow period of underperformance. Apple, after report three consecut quarter of sale declines, final broke out of it funk last month when it report solid,albeit muddled, holiday quarter results. IBM, after year of earn declines, expect to return to growth on a per-shar basi thi year.Both stock are cheap rel to earnings, but I think IBM is the better buy. Here' why.Appl is cheap, but growth will be toughShar of Appl trade around their all-tim high follow the company' fiscal first-quart report, but the stock is still cheap rel to earnings. Appl produc $45.2 billion of net incom over the past 12 months, or $8.39 per share. With a stock price around $131, that put Apple' PE ratio at roughli 15.6.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Apple.But thi calcul ignor the immens amount of cash on Apple' balanc sheet. At the end of the first quarter, Appl had $246 billion of cash and invest and $77 billion of debt, leav a net cash posit of $169 billion. Valu fulli and back out, Apple' cash-adjust PE ratio fall to just 11.5.Appl stockisn't nearli as cheap as it wa a year ago, but the market is still price in minim futur growth even at all-tim highs. There are good reason for this. Appl remain highli depend on the iPhone, which account for nearli 70% of revenu dure the first quarter. With the smartphon market no longer grow quickly, consum take longer to upgrade, and mid-rang devic get better and cheaper, consist iPhon growth go forward is go to be tough to achieve.And even though Appl manag to grow iPhon sale and EP dure the first quarter, net incom declin due to a lower gross margin and higher oper expenses. Share buyback were the sole sourc of per-shar earn growth.Appl is go to need to come up with someth big in order to grow earn meaning in the come years, but it' unclear whether Appl will be abl to come up with the next big thing. Servic revenu ha been grow quickli for Apple, but the juri is still out on whether thi will be enough to drive earn higher.IBM' transform make progressIBM stock is also cheap, despit the ralli over the past year. The compani produc $13.59 in adjust EP dure 2016, put the P/E ratio at 13. IBM' earn have been in declin for a few years, and it revenu ha been slump sinc 2012. But it multiyear transform is make progress, and the compani expect to produc at least $13.80 in adjust EP thi year.Imag source: IBM.IBM ha been divest and shift resourc away from shrink legaci businesses, pour money into growth initi like cloud computing. Thi shift, while painful, is now start to bear fruit. IBM' strateg imper -- what the compani call it variou growth busi -- now account for 41% of total revenu after grow by 13% in 2016.The cloud-comput busi is booming. Total cloud revenu reach $13.7 billion in 2016, up 35%. Cloud deliv as a service, which includ onli infrastructur as a service, platform as a service, and softwar as a service, is at an annual revenu run rate of $8.6 billion, up 61% year over year. IBM' ongo shift to subscript softwar ha hurt overal softwar sale in the past coupl of years, but thesoftwar busi ha now post growthfor three straight quarters.IBM' earn have room to grow simpli becaus the bottom line ha been beaten down so much over the past few years. As IBM continu to remak itself as a cloud and cognit comput company, a return to consist earn growth is a real possibility.IBM is the better betWhil I don't necessarili think that Appl is a bad investment, I find it difficult to believ that the compani will be abl to grow earn from here. The iPhon is go to have to hold up in a world where good phone are get cheaper, and the compani is go to have to come up with someth new and innov that can move the needle.IBM, on the other hand, ha a much broader business, with a vast custom base depend on it product and services. Earn have room to grow substanti as the strateg imperatives, which are more software-heavi than the compani as a whole, continu to expand. Given similar valuations, I'll take IBM ani day.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As previous rumor (and wide expect at thi point), at least one variant may includ an OLE display. OLE display don't come cheap, and the one that Appl is think about use will probabl cost about twice as much as tradit LCD displays.

Samsung ha attempt to launch $1,000-plu phone in the past, like 2013' horribl name Galaxi Round which featur a curv AMOL display that wa respons for the higher price. But Samsung' error wa believ that the curv display itself would justifi the premium to consumers, even though the devic wa larg similar to other Galaxi phone at the time in other respects. Apple' task, then, will be to includ enough differenti factor in the $1,000 model to set it apart.In recent years, carrier have shift away from the subsidi model and toward instal and leas plans. At first, consum were hit with sticker shock that premium smartphon cost over $600, as oppos to the subsid $200 they had previous been paying, but it' safe to say that at thi point consum fulli appreci how much smartphon actual cost.

Is Apple Inc. on the Verge of Cracking This Fast-Growing Market?,2/8/2017,"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is grow at a fast pace in India. The compani sold 2.5 million iPhon in the South Asian countri in 2016, an increas of almost 39% from estim sale of 1.8 million unit the year before. Despit thi impress growth, India remain just a small part of Apple' overal business.makeArticleAd();When compar to estim global iPhon sale of around 234 million unit for 2016, India make up just over 1% of that volume. Thi doe not paint a veri nice pictur for the compani in a smartphon market that' current grow at 18% compar to the global averag of just 3%.The reason for Apple' underperform in India is quit simpl -- high price in a countri with low per capita income. Consid this: India' GDP per capita in 2015 stood at $1,750, while the price of the cheapest iPhon 7 in India is around $840 onAmazonat current exchang rates.However, recent sale trend in India clearli indic that the compani is gain traction among the big-ticket smartphon buyer in the country. Counterpoint Research report that Appl current command 62% of the premium smartphon market (phone cost more than $450) in the country, indic that it is the prefer brand for thi group.Apple' reput as a premium brand will be a tailwind in the long run as India' GDP per capita is expect to rise to $3,500 in 2020, accord to Trade Economics. What' more, Apple' recent negoti with the Indian govern regard the manufactur of iPhon in the countri indic that it is look to make the most of the grow spend power of Indian consumers.Plan for India get a boostTh Indian govern is current engag in a campaign, known as ""Make in India"", to encourag domest manufactur of good by invit multi-n compani to set up shop in the country. Appl is look to take advantag of thi campaign and ha propos build a local manufactur plant in Bengaluru.Bengaluru (aka Bangalore) in India. Imag source: Getti Images.Appl executives, led by the Global Vice-Presid of iPhon oper Priya Balasubramanian, met a group of minist on Jan. 25 to discuss the company' roadmap in the country. Both parti discuss build a local manufactur unit, while Appl also put forward a list of concess that it would need from the government.Th Wall Street Journalreport that an offici with direct knowledg of the meet indic that the deal between the govern and Appl is almost done. Thi mean that Appl will gain custom duti exempt on the import of equip and compon for a period of 15 years.Mor importantly, Apple' deal with the Indian govern could lead to the open of company-own store in the country. In order to set up single-brand retail store in India, the govern requir foreign compani to sourc 30% of their manufactur from local sources. Appl ha request relax on thi front, and if the deal closes, then it will soon be abl to set up it own store in the countri as well.Appl ha reportedli taken step to set up a manufactur unit in India alreadi by select Wistron as it iPhon manufactur for the Indian market. The Taiwanes compani is said to be current expand it smartphon manufactur capac in Bengaluru, accord to theTim of India.In January, an Indian govern offici said that Wistron ha request rapid resolut to it request of expand manufactur oper in Bengaluru. Thi indic that it is look to meet the April target of begin iPhon manufactur oper in the country.Appl ha also line up Foxconn to meet ani surg in the demand. Foxconn alreadi ha a plant in southern India, where it ha doubl it manufactur capac in just a year. Foxconn ha alreadi pledg to set up anoth facil in the countri with an invest of $5 billion. These move to expand capac among Apple' manufactur partner indic that they are prepar for a boost in iPhon product in India.Low iPhon price and improv GDP will boost salesOnc Appl set up it manufactur base in India, it will be abl to lower the price of it phone due to import tax exemptions. Without the 12.5% import tax, Appl could shave almost $100 from the price of an iPhon 7 in India.Thi will make Appl more competit in the premium smartphon segment as it can grab market share from the like ofSamsungbi offer better prices. Thi should help Appl achiev it target of sell seven million iPhon in the countri by 2018.Lower iPhon price will also allow Appl to benefit from India' expand smartphon market. Euromonitor Intern forecast that smartphon sale there will hit the 200 million unit mark by 2020, as compar to estim sale of just 102.4 million unit in 2016.Pair with the grow spend power of Indian shoppers, Appl can make signific stride in the countri due to it lead posit in thi segment.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Add back in unusu expens - which mostli includ a $1.4 billion write-off of Venezuelan asset - of $1.59 billion, and PEP post $9.94 billion in normal oper profits.PepsiCo ha a current market cap of $153 billion, put PEP stock at a price-to-oper incom ratio of about 15.Onc we dig a littl deeper into the numbers, a theme start to emerge: Food is a better busi than soda.Th Valu of FoodTh North American Beverag divis post an oper incom of $2.75 billion on revenu of $20.62 billion in 2015, good enough for an oper margin of 13.3%. In comparison, the combin Frito-Lay and Quaker North American divis deliv oper profit of $4.89 billion on sale of $17.33 billion - an oper margin of 28.2%.In short, the soda busi is drag down the real performer: PepsiCo' food business.Ther is no other major food compani in the Unit State that ha 28% oper margins. Most are in the neighborhood of 15%, just like PEP as a whole.Ther is one that get close, however.Th Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) post 23% oper margin in 2015. It trade at 18 time oper earnings, but share are flirt with a 52-week low.If we valu a combin Frito-Lay/Quak compani at 20 time oper earnings, it alon would be worth $97.8 billion. That valuat give it a premium versu Coca-Cola, but not an excess one. Then if we valu the rest of Pepsi at 15 time oper income, it' worth $75.8 billion.Th Smart Money: Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Is Alreadi InsolventAdd the two divis together, and Pepsi split into two is worth $173.6 billion - or 20% more than the valu of PEP stock today.Bottom Line on PEP StockOn thing is certain. Frito-Lay chips, Quaker Oat and Aunt Jemina syrup are great businesses. Make food is much more profit on a per-dollar basi than soda.Everi PEP stock holder know the compani own Frito-Lay and Quaker. Mani don't know how good those busi are. If PepsiCo' manag spun those two divis out into a new company, it would highlight just how good the food busi realli is.It also would attract investor who don't want to invest in soda.A of thi writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhi Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian OpportunityI Appl Inc.

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock,2/8/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt seem unlik that from a fundament standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earn report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora alreadi announc last month that fourth-quart result would come in ahead of guidanc for both revenu and adjust Ebitda. That disclosur sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibl that the number in the Pandora earn report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news come out of Pandora earnings. The compani ha set itself up for a busi 2017. The replac of Pandora One with Pandora Plu appear to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentari on that initi will be close watch on the Q4 confer call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announc a new ""Premium"" servic to compet with offer fromSpotify,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenThat product should roll out shortly, potenti boost growth in 2017. And Pandora ha said it is aim to return to Ebitda profit in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investor in P stock should believ the company.A Busi 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actual is up about 65% over the past year, after come close to all-tim low in earli 2016. Those gain have come despit mix perform in the business. Revenu is up 14% through the first nine months, and like rose a similar figur in Q4. But about half the year-to-d growth came from the acquisit of TicketFli last October. Advertis revenu also increas 14% through the first three quarter - but came sole from higher pricing. Activ user were actual down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscript revenu declin in the quarter as well.Th user and subscript figur are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simpli doesn't trust that Pandora can creat consist profit base on advertis revenu alone. That' particularli true given thehigh royalti ratesthat took effect at the begin of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrad One to Plu - ad featur like song replay - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-bas model.Th plan from Pandora, as detail after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provid a more stabl revenu base. Move custom to subscription-bas servic both help margin and improv retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock like will rise. But that remain a rel big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earn report, then, the most import number like will come from the company' guidance. That guidanc will give some color as to how success manag think Plu ha been so far - and what kind of opportun Premium ha to boost Pandora earn thi year.But the Pandora earn confer call also seem like it might move P stock. Manag will have anoth opportun to detail it strategi for 2017 and beyond. The compani laid out it ""three-leg stool"" strategi - Plus, Premium and Ticketfli - after the third quarter, but investor weren't terribl impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsTh issu with P stock is that there' a real fear that Pandora' model simpli doesn't quit work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenc by the nearli 80 million activ users. But it' not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalti rate through ad revenu alone. The compani did announc layoff ofabout 7%of it employe in a bid to improv 2017 profits. That simpli rais addit concern about Pandora stock. The most notabl is: Can Pandora realli compet with Apple, Spotifi andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?Aft all, those compani have much larger busi - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the compani ha burn about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarter of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is like to be huge as well, and that' not count depreci or the addit $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Mak Free Profit From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreci in the near term, the compani need to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidanc given in the Pandora earn report will be key. But that aside, investor also will be look for more inform on the plan go forward here.Can Pandora find a nich in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offer from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there realli a profit busi model here, or are royalti rate simpli too difficult to manage?Thos question can't be answer quit yet, but investor will be look at the Pandora earn report close to better assess the company' prospects. And it' like the commentari on the futur - not the past - that will determin how Pandora stock react to Q4 earnings.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

How Good Was Apple Inc.'s Q1 Earnings Report?,2/8/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock ha soar about 8% sinc the compani report better-than-expect Q1 earn result last week. Revenu hit a new record of $78.4 billion, $1 billion ahead of the averag analyst estimate. Earn per share also reach a record at $3.36, up from $3.28 a year earlier. Thi wa $0.15 ahead of analysts' estimates.Thank to thi strong performance, numer Wall Street analystsrais their price targetsforAppl stock. Still, not everybodi is convinced. Some pundit have argu that Apple' result were far wors than Mr. Market seem to think. Let' take a look at whether there' ani substanc to that argument.Good result asid from the iPadFrom a high-level perspective, Apple' Q1 earn report look rock solid. Sure, iPad sale declin yet again -- with unit sale down 19% year over year and revenu down 22% -- but the iPad is far less import for Apple' busi than it wa a few year ago. Appl onli got 7% of it revenu from iPad sale last quarter.makeArticleAd();Th iPad is becom less and less import to Apple' results. Imag source: Apple.Th iPhon busi is what realli matter for Appl these days. Appl sold a record 78.3 million iPhon last quarter, gener $54.4 billion of revenu -- nearli 70% of the companywid total. Mac sale also return to growth and the servic segment continu to surg higher, with revenu up 18% year over year.Did Appl pull a fast one on investors?Writ for MarketWatch last week, Thoma Kee, Jr. argu that investor have complet misunderstood Apple' earn report. He point out that Apple' fiscal first quarter had an extra week thi year.Measur on a per-week basis, Apple' revenue, iPhon sales, and EP were alldown on a year-over-year basis. In other words, without the extra week, Appl would like have post declin rather than increas for all three key metrics. As a result, Kee think that Appl stock is significantli overvalued.It' true that the extra week help Appl last quarter. However, in highlight one anomali in Apple' first quarter results, Kee ignor two other that hurt Appl dure the quarter.Channel inventori chang weigh Appl downFirst, Appl is be much more care with channel inventori thi year than it wa in fiscal 2016. Sinc Appl report revenu when it ship devic to retail -- not when they are sold to end user -- chang in channel inventori can distort Apple' revenu and earn rel to underli demand.Appl didn't increas iPhon channel inventori by veri much in Q1. Imag source: Apple.For the iPhone, Appl grew channel inventori by 1.2 million unit last quarter. Thi mean that 77.1 million of the 78.3 million iPhon Appl ship dure Q1 made it into the hand of customers.Bi contrast, a year earlier, Appl increas iPhon channel inventori by 3.3 million units. Sell-through to end user total 71.5 million in that quarter. After adjust for these channel inventori changes, last quarter' weekli iPhon sale rate wa almost exactli in line with the prior-year result.Thi adjust is even starker for the iPad. Appl reduc it iPad channel inventori by about 700,000 unit last quarter, compar to a 900,000-unit increas a year earlier. Thi explain about half of the year-over-year declin in iPad sales. The neg impact of the channel inventori chang more than offset the benefit of have an extra week.A patent settlement skew Apple' Q1 2016 resultsA second factor that hurt Appl last quarter is that it had receiv a one-tim $548 million gain relat to a patent infring case in Q1 2016. Thi wa pure profit, so it boost Apple' gross margin by more than 0.7 percentag point in that quarter and ad about $0.10 per share in pre-tax income.Strip out thi one-tim gain and the chang in channel inventory, Apple' revenu and EP growth would have been much higher last quarter than what the compani actual reported.Additionally, the $548 million patent gain in Q1 2016 creat a tough comparison for Apple' fast-grow servic segment last quarter. Appl report 18% revenu growth in servic last quarter anyway, but on an apples-to-appl basi it would have post a 30% revenu increase.Apple' quarter wa as strong as it seem to beIt' imposs to know precis how much channel inventori chang impact Apple' revenu and profit last quarter. But a reason guess is that they cost Appl $2 billion-$2.5 billion of revenu and close to $1 billion of pre-tax profit, rel to Q1 2016. The non-recurr of the patent gain wa an addit $548 million headwind to revenu and pre-tax profit.Aft make these adjustments, Apple' revenu may have been down slightli year-over-year on a per-week basis, but EP still increased. Even thi sort of slow growth is fairli good for Appl right now, as the strong dollar is caus persist revenu and profit headwinds.Furthermore, Appl is wide believ to be work on a massiv upgrad of the iPhon for 2017. There' a good chanc that these rumor are alreadi impact the upgrad rate as some custom hold out for the new model. That bode well for a return to robust (and indisputable) revenu and earn growth in 2018.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Q4 Earnings Preview,2/8/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsForNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), 2016 wa as good a year as it wa for the Atlanta Falcons. But we know how the Falcons' stori ended.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI NVDA stock about to undergo a similar fourth-quart collapse?Go into the Feb. 9 earn report,analyst are wary, with just half say buy and most of the rest say hold - which is someth they say when they don't know what to say.Earn are expect to be just a littl better than the previou quarter, net incom of someth over $550 million, 87 cent per share, on revenu of $2.11 billion, just a littl more than last quarter' $2 billion.If Nvidia meet those expectations, however, or even exce them onli by a littl bit, I expect NVDA stock to fall. Here is why.An Overpr StockNVDA is, to the surpris of no one, incred overpr right now. At the open bid of $119 per share on Feb. 8, Nvidia stock is trade for 44 time next year' earn estimates. It market cap, almost $65 billion, is 13 time it fiscal 2016 revenue, and nearli 9 time it anticip 2017 revenue.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterMeet analysts' target thi quarter will show that it incred Octob perform wa not a fluke, where revenu rose 60% over the previou quarter and profit doubled.Mi call is not base on Nvidia have done anyth wrong.In fact, it isdo an enorm amount right.It graphic chip are find new market in cloud data center and in cars. It origin nich in game is the onli thing happen in the PC space. Huge new market in augment and virtual realiti are beckoning. Along withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia is end the age ofIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) gener purpos microprocessors, replac it withan era of specialization.Th problem is,a our Tim Biggan ha observed, that NVDA stock is current price for perfection, and perfect is in the eye of the beholder. Ani misstep, even an imagin one, can hit a stock hard when it' up 280% in a year.Lot of thing could happen. Analyst could decid that meet expect is not good enough. They could find a shinier object somewher els in the market. They could start get jumpi over a possibl trade war, one that ha alreadystart with curb on visas.Or, perhaps, Nvidia could get intoa spat over licens of intellectu property, a hot topic wherev silicon chip are made and sold.It' possible.Who Miss the Boat on NVDA Stock?Of course, there is alway the chanc that thi is wish thinking, as often occur with hot stocks.Investor and analyst who miss the boat on a stock will talk it down, in hope that it will drop and they can get on board. Thi ha happen mani time with such stock asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). No tree grow to the sky.For these investors, a fall in Nvidia stock of 15%, to a market cap of about $50 billion - worth 7 time 2017 revenu - would seem more reasonable.I Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction?What happen in these case is that a stock will start to fall, and investor will immedi buy it back to it original, overvalu position. Nvidia doe make some veri hot hardware, it is continu push the perform envelope, and it ha strong posit in all the fastest-grow market of our time.Thi is one of the differ between invest and trade that investor need to understand. Trader want a hot stock to go down, but that desire, or that fact, doe not mean a hot compani ha grown cold.It mean that a lot of peopl who miss a good dealstil want it.NVDA stock may inde fall after earn Thursday evening, in other words. But if it does, a lot of investor will be wait to pick it up and consid it a bargain.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

Moreover, recent launch product like Bot Manag and Imag Manag will take some time to fulli penetr the market. Hence, we don't expect revenu growth to acceler at least in the near term.Further, faster increas in capit expenditur and increas headcount invest will keep margin under pressur in full year 2017.Despit the headwinds, we believ that the compani ha signific growth prospect in 2017.

Additionally, AAPL stock is struggl to pull away from the graviti of $130 - an area rife with heavi option open interest in the Februari and March series.Furthermore, AAPL stock ha outrun support from it 10- and 20-day move averag - trendlin that provid key support throughout the back half of Apple' late 2016 rally. Currently, the 10-day trendlin lie near $125, and a correct back to thi region would not be unthink should a round of profit take set in.Ther are short-term sentiment risk for AAPL stock as well. Thomson/First Call report that 41 of the 49 analyst follow Appl rate the share a ""buy"" or better, with onli one ""sell"" rate to be found.That' plenti of room for adjustment.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterAnd with Appl draw near to the consensu 12-month price target of $139.07, we could see a few brokerag firm downgrad AAPL stock to hold in the next month or so to bring expect back in line - similar to what Barclay did back in late January, cut AAPL to ""equalweight"" from ""overweight.""Look at Appl options, specul trader appear to be prepar for just such a correction. Typically, Apple' put/cal open interest ratio for the nearest two month rest in the 0.6-0.7 range, with a heavi focu toward call OI. The current February/March ratio, however, rest at 0.9, with put gain consider traction and hint at potenti short-term weak for AAPL stock.A for the magnitud of the anticip move, March impli are price in the potenti for a nearli 4% rise or fall in Appl stock ahead of expiration. That place the upper bound near $135 and the lower bound near $125.Given Apple' reluct to continu to move higher in the wake of last week' earnings, a correct to the stock' 10-day move averag near $125 could be in the cards.2 Trade for AAPL StockPut Spread:Thos trader look to profit from a short-term drop in Appl might want to consid a March $125/$130 bear put spread. At last check, thi spread wa offer at $1.28, or $128 per pair contracts. Breakeven lie at $128.72, while a maximum profit of $3.72, or $372 per pair of contracts, is possibl if AAPL stock close at or below $125 when March option expire.Rid Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock on It Next Pop HigherPut Sell:If you'r not will to bet directli against Appl stock at thi point - and with the share on a hot streak now, I wouldn't blame you - then we can turn that put spread into a more neutral play by just sell the March $125 put. At last check, thi put wa bid at 68 cents, or $68 per contract.A always, the upsid to thi put sell strategi is that you keep the premium as long as Appl stock close abov $125 when March option expire. The downsid is that if AAPL stock trade below $125 ahead of expiration, you could be assign 100 share for each sold put at a cost of $125 per share.A of thi writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceDon't Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Until ESPN Is ""Fixed""7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the MarketTh 7 Most Popular Vanguard Fund for 401k PlansTh postI Appl Inc.

Net incom declin from $18.36 billion in the year prior to $17.89 billion.Apple' iPhon coupl with AirPods. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Appl is still rake in alotof cash -- most compani could onli dream of gener roughli $18 billion inannualnet income, let alon bring in that much in a singl quarter -- but investor should pay attent when profit declines. Let' go over the key factor that drove Apple' oper and net incom figur down year over year, even as the compani achiev record quarterli revenue.Low gross profit marginAppl saw it gross profit drop from $30.42 billion in the prior-year period to $30.18 billion in the company' most recent period. Although the company' revenu wa up year over year, cost of sale grew at a faster pace than revenu did, result in a declin in gross profit margin.Appl did note on it most recent earn call that in the prior-year period, Apple' revenu ""includ the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infring payment."" Though not a substanti part of Apple' $75 billion-plu in revenu in that quarter, CFO Luca Maestri did say that thi payment boost gross margin in the year-ago quarter by 40 basi points, or 0.4%.The gross-margin stori isn't the onli thing that drove Apple' profit slightli lower year over year, though.High oper expensesGross profit margin is an import part of overal profitability, but a company' oper expens -- which includ product develop cost as well as sale and market cost -- are also key determin of a company' profitability.Though Appl onli increas it sales, general, and administr expens by just shi of $100 million year over year, it research and develop spend surg to $2.87 billion -- up more than $400 million from the roughli $2.4 billion the compani spent in the prior-year period.Apple' oper expens grew 9% from $6.25 billion in the prior-year period to $6.82 billion in the most recent quarter. Sinc operating-expens growth wa greater than revenu growth, which wa approxim 3.3%, oper expens becam a larger part of the company' revenu and thu neg affect oper profit margin.What doe thi mean for Appl investors?Th key headwind to Apple' oper profit right now seem to be the company' continu increas in research and development, coupl with slow revenu growth.It' probabl not a good idea for the compani to let up on it research and develop investments, as the invest made today are what allow the compani to have a chanc of bring compel new product to market tomorrow, potenti drive revenu and profit increas over the long term.In the near to medium term, Apple' best bet of return to consist oper profit growth is like to be from faster revenu growth. Hope seem to be high that Apple' next-gener iPhon model will drive a so-cal ""super cycle"" such as what the compani enjoy with the iPhon 6-seri of product begin in late 2014.If that come to pass, Appl could see signific year-over-year revenu growth in the first quarter of it come fiscal year.Look out longer term, though, it' hard to predict if and how the compani will deliv sustain profit growth. Can the company' core product categori do it? Or will the compani need to enter or creat new product categori beyond the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and servic to support such growth?Thes are question that will onli be answer in time.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"The Most Cash That Apple, Inc. Has Ever Had",2/7/2017,"You'd think that after return over $200 billion in cash to investor through it capit return program over the past five years, that there'd be a sizabl dent inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) money mountain. You'd be wrong.To be clear, Apple' cash posit would certainli be about $200 billion more if it weren't for the program, but the fact still stand that Appl gener so much cash that it simpli can't give that money back fast enough. Oper cash flow wa $65.8 billion in fiscal 2016, which end in September. Even after deduct $12.8 billion in capit expenditures, the Mac maker enjoy $53 billion in free cash flow -- leav plenti to cover the $12.2 billion paid out in dividend and dividend equival and buy back $30 billion worth of stock. The same is true for the most recent fiscal first quarter.Appl Store Pudong. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here' the thing: It' also true for almost everi year sinc Appl start return capital. Capit return have exceed 100% of free cash flow in onli one fiscal year sinc the program commenc (2014, and onli by about 12%). The net result is that despit the massiv amount of capit be returned, Appl now ha the most cash it' ever had on the balanc sheet. For a compani that love superl as much as Appl does, it' almost surpris that it didn't point thi out on last month' earn call.Cash is kingA of the end of 2016, Appl wa sit on $246 billion in total cash, which is the highest it cash posit ha ever been. Even if you were to factor in debt, which is predominantli use to fund the capit return program, and look at Apple' cash posit on a net basis, that' also the highest it' ever been. Despit it best effort to return as much as possible, Apple' cash keep march higher. Gross cash and net cash begin to diverg in 2013 when Appl start take on debt, but you can see both are at all-tim highs.Data source: SEC file and author' calculations. Chart by author. Calendar quarter shown.It' also true that Apple' cash is increasingli concentr abroad, as the debt is use as a way to avoid repatri taxes. At thi point, 94% of Apple' total cash is held by foreign subsidiaries. Thi figur wa closer to 60% half a decad ago.Data source: SEC file and author' calculations. Chart by author. Calendar quarter shown.What come nextGiven this, combin with the fact that Appl is current review it capit return plan and will give investor an updat in April, there seem to be plenti of room for Appl to get even more aggress if it want to. When it launch the capit return program, it final acknowledg year of critic that the compani had way more cash than it would ever conceiv need -- and it current ha about $60 billion more (or about 50%) net cash than when it start capit returns.Th curv ball is the practic limit on how much debt Appl should take on. If the compani can convinc the Trump administr to deliv on that repatri holiday promise, that could potenti pave the way for some type of massiv return or special dividend. Otherwise, that money mountain is onli get bigger.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Happens to Qualcomm Inc. if the NXP Deal Gets Killed?,2/7/2017,"Share ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) have plung nearli 20% sinc the begin of the year due to a doubl whammi of bad news. First, the U.S. Feder Trade Commiss file anantitrust lawsuitagainst the chipmaker, claim that it leverag it portfolio of critic wireless patent to push competitor out of the market. Shortli afterwards,Applesu Qualcommfor allegedli withhold ""rebate"" payment for it use of Qualcomm modems.But that wa just the tip of the iceberg -- Qualcomm ha been struggl with other similar antitrust lawsuit across the world over the past two years. It wa fine $975 million and forc to slash it licens fee in China, fine anoth $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in addit fine in Europ and Taiwan.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();However, the impact of those fine and reduc licens fee are overshadow by a much bigger long-term risk -- the potenti cancel of it planned$47 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . Let' see what could happen to Qualcomm if thi massiv deal get derailed.A brief look at Qualcomm' problemsQualcomm ha two main busi unit -- the chipmak one (QCT) and the licens one (QTL). The QCT unit, which sell it flagship Snapdragon mobil chip and baseband modems, gener most of it revenue. The QTL unit, which own a massiv portfolio of 3G/4G patents, gener most of it profits.Both busi have been under pressur over the past few years. The QCT unit ha been lose market share to cheaper chip from challeng likeMediaTekand first-parti ARM chip from big OEM like Apple,Huawei,Samsung, andXiaomi. The QTL unit is struggl with the aforement regulatori scrutiny, sinc mani OEM consid it cut (up to 5%) of the wholesal price of each smartphon sold to be too high.To offset those declines, Qualcomm is diversifi the QCT busi intoadjac markets, with special Snapdragon chip for wearables, drones, connect cars, and other Internet of Thing (IoT) devices. A crucial part of thi push is in the connect car, which is wide consid a next-gen comput platform. To gain a foothold in thi market, Qualcomm acquir IoT and automot chipmak CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015.Whi Qualcomm need NXPTo expand further, Qualcomm agre to buy NXPin order to also expand into new market -- name automobiles. NXP becam the top automot chipmak in the world after it $12 billion purchas of Freescal in late 2015. NXP also hold lead posit in the network and safeti system markets. Qualcomm expect the combin compani to gener annual revenu of over $30 billion (compar to Qualcomm' estim revenu of $23.8 billion thi year), and help it establish lead posit across the mobile, automotive, IoT, security, RF, and network markets.Qualcomm believ that the deal will grow it ""servic address markets"" by about 40% to $138 billion in 2020, and that the deal will be ""significantli accret to non-GAAP earn immediately"" after it closes. It expect the deal to gener $500 million in annual run-rat cost synergi two year after the deal closes.Thi deal will clearli help the QCT pivot away from the sluggish smartphon market. But it will also greatli expand the QTL' patent portfolio, which could enabl Qualcomm to collect licens fee across a much wider rang of industries.Whi the deal could run into troubleTh FTC ha alreadi accus Qualcomm of charg compet baseband modem maker higher licens fee for it wireless patents, which made their modem pricier for smartphon maker to use. Therefore, the FTC is unlik to approv a deal which could give Qualcomm the same power over other grow market like IoT devic and connect cars.If the FTC lawsuit derail the NXP deal, Qualcomm will be left with a fade QCT busi and a potenti crippl QTL one -- which would crippl the chipmaker' long-term growth prospects. Some analyst have specul that Qualcomm might need to divest some busi or split in two (along the QCT and QTL lines) to gain regulatori approv -- but split it low-margin and high-margin busi could yield unpredict results.However, some analyst believ that the FTC will simpli drop the case, sinc Maureen Ohlhausen -- a Republican who wa recent appoint as the interim chairwoman by Presid Trump -- previous express her strong opposit to the lawsuit. Dure last quarter' confer call, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf express confid that the deal would close, and that recent legal action were mere ""driven by commerci disputes.""Th key takeawayA a Qualcomm investor, I'm disappoint with the recent legal action against the chipmaker. While those move might forc Qualcomm to lower it licens fees, I'm not convinc that they will derail the NXP deal. The risk have certainli gone up for Qualcomm, but I still believ that it forward P/E of 11 and 4% forward yield could limit it downsid potential.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: Industry Comments on Visa Ban,2/7/2017,"The technolog sector ha grown increasingli depend on foreign talent over the year such that today it can't function without it. On the face of things, thi ha been realli good for innov help the U.S. maintain it technolog lead over others. But dig down a bit deeper, what thi mean is that the U.S. is increasingli incap of produc thi talent itself. Thi is not a good situat to be in, particularli when you consid that countri like China are do all they can to develop indigen intellectu property.That' probabl the reason Presid Trump' draft propos accord to Bloomberg read as follows: ""Our country' immigr polici should be design and implement to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. nation interest… Visa program for foreign workers... should be administ in a manner that protect the civil right of American worker and current law residents, and that priorit the protect of American worker - our forgotten work peopl - and the job they hold.""Ther are mani conflict view and opinion about H-1B visa that compani use to employ peopl from other countri when adequ resourc in the field of science, technology, engin and math aren't avail locally. But sinc foreign labor is usual cheaper, critic say that compani tend to employ foreign even when the skill are avail thu depress wage for the industri as a whole.Ron Hira, an associ professor at Howard University, ha done extens research on the topic. Support say there isn't room to control wage inflat sinc the program is highli regul and technolog compani like AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, in fact, pay handsomely.Whatev the opinion on the wage rate, there' no deni that the job go to foreigners. If the trend continues, high tech American employe will have a harder time find jobs, thu gradual close down the institut produc them. The per capita GDP attribut to such job will also go down as tech employe from abroad obtain American citizenship.It' also true that a countri is in a posit of absorb others, give them a home, a job, etc. when it is itself in a posit of strength. But when it can't find local tech workers, it' definit not in that posit and may need some temporari measur to rejuvenate.There' also anoth side to the story. If tech compani are unsuccess in their letter of appeal, lawsuit and other measur they'r take against the Presid and the propos is enforced, they may decid to employ the same talent in intern facilities. A company' main motiv and object is to gener profit, and there could be initi cost of set up such intern operations.Th visa issu ha been club with anoth import one involv terror becaus the Presid ha block all refuge from enter the U.S. for 120 day (the ban is indefinit for Syrian refuge possibl becaus of their act of vandal across Europe). Citizen of seven predominantli Muslim countri like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen were also ban from enter the U.S. for 90 days. Thi seem like a rel short period of time and what will be achiev in the interim remain unclear.In the meantime, Attorney Gener Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, file a complaint say Trump' order is ""undermin the state' sovereign interests"" in violat of equal protect law under the Fifth Amendment. Washington State also su the Presid with support from Amazon and Microsoft.But don't imagin that the so-cal refuge are helpless victim becaus they have plenti of power lobbi work for them. The American Civil Liberti Union (ACLU) and the Council on American-Islam Relat (CAIR) are get readi to file lawsuits. What' more, Googl ha creat a ""crisi fund"" with $2 million and it employe have contribut a like amount that they are gift the ACLU. Other fund are also on the way.But tech compani have plenti to say about both issues:Apple: CEO Tim Cook told employe that the compani had commun with the White House. ""I'v heard from mani of you who are deepli concern about the execut order issu (Friday) restrict immigr from seven Muslim-major countries. I share your concerns. It is not a polici we support…Appl would not exist without immigration, let alon thrive and innov the way we do,"" he wrote in an email.Google: CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo to employees: ""It' pain to see the person cost of thi execut order on our colleagues…We'v alway made our view on immigr issu known publicli and will continu to do so."" He also said that at least 187 Googl staff were affect by the ban.Found Sergey Brin: ""It' a debat about fundament valu and thought policymak and mani of the other things, I think, that are appar not univers ador but I think the vast major of our countri and legisl support."" Googl ha a problem with the orders, includ ""extrem vetting"" of immigrants. After plan their move for some day 2K+ Googl employe from at least eight Googl offic walk out on Monday afternoon.Facebook: Founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on hi Facebook page: ""Expand the focu of law enforc beyond peopl who are real threat would make all American less safe by divert resources, while million of undocu folk who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation."" In an offici statement on Saturday, Facebook said: ""We are assess the impact on our workforc and determin how best to protect our peopl and their famili from ani advers effects.""IntelINTC: Brian Krzanich: ""I have heard from mani of you, and share your concern over the recent execut order and want you to know thi is not a polici we can support,"" and ""First, as the grandson of immigr and the CEO of a compani that wa co-found by an immigrant, we believ that law immigr is critic to the futur of our compani and thi nation.""On of Intel' first hire wa Andi Grove, who surviv the Nazi occup of Hungari and ran Intel for 11 year establish it as the leader in microprocessor technology. He also said: ""At Intel we believ that immigr is an import part of our divers and inclus efforts"" and ""Inclus is about make everyon feel welcom and part of our community.""It offici statement says, ""We are provid support to potenti impact employees, all of whom are in thi countri lawfully. As a compani co-found by an immigrant, we continu to support law immigration. We will continu to provid ani impact employe with Intel' full support.""A statement on the compani websit say that it support ""legisl or administr action to improv the immigr system for highli skill employees."" Half it 106K employe work in other countri and it U.S. worker includ roughli 3K foreign on work visa for those with special skills. But the number of employe from the seven ban nation is not known. Intel explain it contribut to Trump' inaugur committe by say that it gave Intel a seat at the tabl on issu import to the company.Microsoft: Microsoft' presid and chief legal offic Brad Smith wrote in a letter to the Secretari of State Rex Tillerson that there are current 76 U.S. visa holder within the tech firm and 41 depend who are citizen of the seven countri mention in the order. ""These are not situat that law-abid individu should be forc to confront when there is no evid that they pose a secur or safeti threat to the Unit States,"" he said.Satya Nadella, Microsoft' CEO, said, ""A an immigr and as a CEO, I'v both experienc and seen the posit impact that immigr ha on our company, for the country, and for the world"" while post Smith' email to employe on LinkedIn. Microsoft is tri everyth to keep it option open. On the one hand it is join Washington state to sue Trump while on the other, it is request the govern to make an except for ""respons known travel with press needs"" so peopl with passport from one of the countri list in the order can return to the U.S. as long as they have a valid work or student visa and have not commit a crime in the U.S.Micorsoft is also ask that employe and student affect by the ban be allow to travel outsid of the U.S. for busi reasons, except to the seven countri on the list. It is also ask that peopl with passport from one of the countri be allow to go home for famili reason on a case-by-cas basis.Tesla: CEO Elon Musk, one of onli a few tech execut on Trump' busi advisori team and manufactur job initiative: ""The blanket entri ban on citizen from certain primarili Muslim countri is not the best way to address the country' challenges,"" he tweet on Saturday. ""Mani peopl neg affect by thi polici are strong support of the US. They'v done right, not wrong & don't deserv to be rejected.""TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey call the impact of the order ""real and upsetting.""Netflix: CEO Reed Hast said, ""Trump' action are hurt Netflix employe around the world, and are so un-American it pain us all… It is time to link arm togeth to protect American valu of freedom and opportunity.""UberCEO Travi Kalanick told employe he would talk to Trump about it in Presid Trump' first busi advisori group meeting. ""While everi govern ha their own immigr controls, allow peopl from all around the world to come here and make America their home ha larg been the U.S.' polici sinc it founding. That mean thi ban will impact mani innoc people,"" Kalanick said.BoxCEO Aaron Levi who is Iranian-American said ""At the corpor level, we are tri to take inventori on who could be impact and ensur that they stay within the countri for now... We are realli just get a handl on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultim how we protect employe in the process.""

Taiwan' Wistron is set up the unit that is expect to commenc oper in the first half of 2017 (or by April-end accord to some news sites).Appl ha been tri to get concess from the Indian govern but progress on that front is not clear as of now. India is an import market for Apple, which sold 2.5 million iPhon in the countri in 2016. An estim 750 million smartphon will be sold in India by 2020, so one can understand whi Appl CEO Tim Cook said that India is ""the place to be.""Appl Manufactur In U.S.: Terri Gou, CEO of Apple' largest contractor Foxconn, ha said that the company, along with top custom Apple, is consid the set up of a display panel manufactur unit in the U.S. that could creat up to 50K jobs.

Tariq' experi includ initi to enhanc the retail experi at Apple' 490 stores. As Ford evolv as a compani make vehicl in a self-driv world, it will be increasingli blend technolog and auto, so it' easi to see that the brand might need repositioning. Steer the compani through these chang seem to be the role Tariq will play.Ajit Pai Is FCC Chairman: Net neutral oppos Ajit Pai ha been appoint Chairman of the FCC by the Trump administration. Pai wa one of two Republican on the five-memb board, so hi elev won't requir senat approval. He replac Tom Wheeler, who resign soon after Trump won the elections. Stream compani like Netflix, Appl and Amazon won't be too pleas although Netflix indic that it fan follow provid it a certain amount of leverag with carriers. The truth is, it alreadi ha arrang with carrier that allow them to charg it differenti rates, contrari to the principl of net neutrality.Facebook Get New VR Chief: Facebook ha made an import hire in Hugo Barra, who ha spent the last three year rev up the market machineri at Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphon are attribut to him) and serv as Google' Android chief befor that. Facebook' VR plan is more on the high end, which ha somewhat impact the adopt of the Rift, so it' easi to see how it could benefit from experience.Barra will replac Brendan Irib as Oculu head and will also head up all VR effort at Facebook. Irib will move to the PC division, to speed up PC-base VR development. As part of hi recent testimoni defend Oculu technology, Zuckerberg said earlier that VR will take five to ten year to go mainstream and that Facebook will probabl have to spend anoth $3 billion befor it get where it want to go. So it clearli ha long rang plans.Microsoft to Invest $1 Billion in Cloud Security: Microsoft ha said that it will continu to invest a billion dollar into cloud secur over the next few year and some say thi is exclud acquisit (such as Aorato for enterpris security, Adallom for gener cloud secur applications, and Secur Islands, for protect of data and files) and invest through it ventur capit arm.Th adopt of cloud infrastructur by enterpris to a great extent hing on the secur of offerings. Thi along with the far greater competit in the cloud than in desktop comput make secur veri import for Microsoft. Sinc the compani now ha a synchron oper system across platform in window 10, it can hope to bring increasingli secur offer and therebi pick up market share.Microsoft Bond Sale: Soon after rais $19.75 billion in bond in Aug 2016, Microsoft sold anoth $17 billion worth.

Google' strength is seen in it prowess in search, which is the mainstay of it advertis busi and where it remain ""larg unchallenged"". Appl is seen as repeatedli underperform expect and it inabl to ""demonstr that genuin innov technolog desir by consum are in the pipeline"".Googl Hire VR Employee: Just a few month after Googl launch it Daydream View VR headset (basic featur and head strap pack into a stylish packag that retail for just $49), the compani ha hire away Claud Zellweger, who head HTC' VR unit. Zellweg led the team respons for the Vive VR headset, so thi is probabl an indic that Googl ha big VR hardwar plans.Alibaba Lead Fund Round in India' Paytm: Alibaba is lead a $200 million fund round in Paytm Ecommerce, which wa spun out of One97 Communications. One97 also offer the Paytm Digit Wallet, in which Alibaba and it financi arm own a high stake.

However, the court rule that the Rift maker wasn't guilti of trade secret theft, a point that will be use by Oculu to frame it appeal.Googl Privaci Polici Under EU Scrutiny: Googl made a signific chang to it privaci polici back in June. The change, while enabl user to more easili see and delet the inform that Googl ha on them, also alter Google' age-old polici to separ data on Gmail and YouTub from it wide use DoubleClick business.

The modul can be use to hous batteries, haptic devic that provid a sensat to the user, displays, photovolta cells, cameras, GP sensors, speaker and a rang of health sensor includ thermometers, hygrometers, blood pressur sensor and sweat sensors. The limit space in the wearabl to serv individu custom need wa the reason for develop the band.Appl Mac Chip Could Hurt Intel Business: Both Boomberg' Mark Gurman and Ian King and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani have given view on how an Appl develop co-processor(codenam T310 for Mac base on ARM technolog can hurt Intel' chip business. Accord to Bloomberg, the Appl chip, which went into develop last year, will gradual take over the function of the Intel processor, pave the way for Apple' processor independence.But chip gener take 3-4 year to get into mass production, so Daryanani' view that it will not impact Intel' busi in 2017 and also possibl in 2018 make sense. He say that if Intel is total design out, it will be a $2-3 billion hit to annual revenue, $750 million to $1 billion hit to oper incom with a 12-16 cent impact on the annual EPS.Intel Go: Intel is boost it automot effort by creat a new divis call Intel Go to solv hardwar problem like comput vision, infotainment, 5G wireless connect and AI technology. It will also offer relat softwar solutions. Intel hold the view that the car is the next comput hub and it intend to do all it can to grab a greater dollar share. As car incorpor more electron and move toward complet automation, Intel' innovations, partnership and invest may be expect to put it in front and center of the new opportun as it unfolds.Googl Instant Apps: First announc at the 2016 Googl I/O conference, Instant App are a workaround between full app and the web. Single-us or infrequently-us app sometim have to be download becaus the mobil web browser of compani aren't that great. Sinc unnecessari download are noth but wast memori and space, Googl will stream part of the app from it own servers, so neither the download nor the mobil web is required. The compani is now roll out the servic to select users.Slack' Answer to Microsoft: The Slack Enterpris Grid design for larger and more complex busi offer ident manag technology, data loss prevent and advanc secur systems. The Slack solut is also compliant with regulatori requir in healthcar and financ sectors, which may be partli respons for it swell user base.Th compani said that it now ha 1.5 million pay users, which is commend sinc it doesn't offer mani other comput build block that rival Microsoft does. In Nov 2016, Microsoft announc Teams, which connect the chat featur with the Offic 365 cloud suite, therebi facilit collaboration. The two are now compet head-on.M&A and CollaborationsCisco Buy AppDynamics: Cisco paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics, an applic perform manag compani just befor it wa schedul to float it IPO.

Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That, by the way, is a nice way of say the compani lost market share.Last October, though, Applefinallylaunch new MacBook Pro machines. It updat both it 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, and becaus of all the new featur it pack into these updat systems, the compani charg higher price for them than it did for the prior-gener models.Now that Apple' first-quart financi result are out -- the first quarter in which the compani would recogn revenu for the new system -- investor can get an idea of how well custom have receiv the new systems.And, perhap unsurprisingly, thing are look good.Put Mac back on a growth pathAppl report ship 5.37 million Mac in the first quarter of it fiscal year 2017, net $7.24 billion in revenu from those sales.

Appl simpli need to make sure it provid regular updat to it Mac product so the lineup doesn't get stale.Thes regular updat can be as simpl as adopt the latest processor and ad other technolog improvements, though obvious the bigger and more interest the chang -- think the Touch Bar, the Forc Touch trackpad, and so on -- the better.Th Mac doesn't make up a huge portion of Apple' annual revenue. Mac sale made up less than 10% of Apple' fiscal first-quart revenue, though thi percentag is bound to increas as Appl move past the peak iPhon quarter. And when taken in conjunct with Apple' other non-iPhon products, it' still a reason contributor to revenue.Further, much ha been said about the strength of Apple' ecosystem and the company' abil to build product that work well together. If the compani can sell more Macs, then that might also translat into custom who will switch to -- or stick with -- Apple' iPhone.Appl should do it veri best to make sure all of the element of it ecosystem are strong, to maxim the potenti valu it can extract from said ecosystem.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Did Intel Corporation Just Reveal That It Will Be Inside of the Apple Inc. iPhone 8?,2/7/2017,"OnIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) most recent earn call, CFO Robert Swan provid some insight into the company' gross profit margin guidanc for the full year of 2017.Intel guid to full-year gross profit margin of 62% on a GAAP basi for 2017 -- a 110 basi point (1.1%) improv from the 60.9% gross profit margin that it report for 2016.A pair of Appl iPhones. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, Intel tell investor to expect gross profit margin of 62% in the first quarter of 2017, which suggest that the compani isn't expect margin to improv throughout the year. Thi is a littl bit surprising, as Intel usual enjoy the benefit of revenu leverag dure the second half of ani given year rel to the first half, sinc industrywid person comput sale tend to be higher in the second half of the year compar to the first.Swan explain what' go on, and from that explanation, the chipmak appear to be bet on have won cellular modem order for the next-generationApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone.Th CFO speaksSwan said that ""headwinds"" to the company' gross profit margin in 2017 compar to 2016 will come in the form of increas non-volatil memori product sales, as well as from modem sales. The execut wa quick to explain that increas memori and modem sale lead to ""good growth, increas profitability, [and] good earnings."" That said, he also conced that those product carri lower gross profit margin than the rest of the company' business.Th way to think about it is this: It' gener better for a compani to sell $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit marginand$30 worth of product at 30% gross profit margin -- dilut the averag gross profit margin percentag to 53% -- than to just sell the $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin, assum all els is equal.What doe thi have to do with the iPhon 8?Circl back to the topic at hand, let' go over whi thi commentari might suggest that Intel is insid the next iPhone.If we look at the trend in Intel' cellular modem revenue, we see that the compani saw an initi ramp-up of shipment dure it third quarter, with sale acceler in the fourth quarter. Thi is consist with Apple' iPhon ramp-up plans: it build a bunch of phone in anticip of the launch, sell even more phone in the quarter follow the launch, and then it see iPhon sale cool off in the follow quarter -- until the cycl begin anew.If Intel doesn't expect to be in the next-gener iPhone, then investor should expect the compani to see a substanti drop in cellular modem revenu dure the second half of 2017. (In thi case, Intel would onli be ship modem into older, discount iPhon 7 models.)In that case, cellular modemswouldn'tb a headwind to gross profit margin improv for Intel dure the second half of 2017 rel to the first half of 2017, sinc it cellular modem volumes/revenu would natur declin -- prove atailwindto averag gross profit margin, not aheadwind.It seem likely, then, that Intel expect to be insid of at least some of Apple' next-gener iPhon models.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here’s How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%,2/6/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsShar ofAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) still appear undervalu despit the compani alreadi significantli outperform the market. If you bought stock in Alibaba sinc the end of December, you'r up almost 20%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, for reason I will outline, Alibaba stock - thank to emerg in the cloud and the momentum in it core e-commerc busi - can still deliv 25% return in the next 12 to 18 months.Assess the Valu in Alibaba StockAlibaba share have risen some 15% year to date, compar with about 2% rise in theS&P 500 Index. Base on fiscal 2018 earn estim of $4.30 per share, Alibaba stock is current price at a forward price-earn ratio of roughli 23, which is about in line with the averag stock in the S&P 500.And here' the thing: Assum the compani doe earn $4.30 per share, that would translat to year-over-year earn growth of 23%. From my vantag point, Alibaba stock remain one of the better bargain on the market even with it recent rally.In other words, investor still have an opportun to buy not onli into a great growth story, but also diversifi their invest by bet on the growth of China' middl class. But Alibaba is more than just a bet on China' recov economy. The company, which saw a 54% jump inthird-quart revenue, lead to an impress 17-cent beat on the bottom line, crush Wall Street' fiscal estim on almost everi metric.3 Big Buyout Deal That Could Crush InvestorsOften compar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) becaus of their e-commerc similarities, Alibaba founder/execut chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang prove they can do what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo ha shown a knack for: Mash the profit-margin acceler whenev he feel like it and when the market least expect it. And as with Amazon, Alibaba' cloud platform Alicloud (which post a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue) ha becom a force.Not onli is Alibaba enjoy an increas in the number of pay customers, the custom are also spend higher than usual. All told, the company' strong revenu growth, driven by it diversifi technolog and data strategi continu to pay off. And with the compani boost it 2017 fiscal year revenu growth guidanc from 48% to 53%, Alibaba is show no sign of slow down.Bottom Line for Alibaba StockWith cloud revenu begin to take a bigger portion of the business, combin with the strength in it core e-commerc operation, BABA ha ton of room to run.Here' How Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200A such, while I'm not will to suggest BABA deserv the same respect as Amazon, which is price at a forward P/E of 63, Alibaba should command a P/E of 30, which put Alibaba stock at around $130, deliv almost 25% to 30% in the next year-and-a-half or so.A of thi writing, Richard Saintvilu did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialTh postHere' How Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%appear first onInvestorPlace."
"3 Stocks That Turned $5,000 into $10,000 or More in Just 3 Years",2/6/2017,"Smart investor know the stock market is a long term game, and tri to seek out compani that can doubl your money in just a few year time is a fool' errand. Anyth can happen in the short run to upset the best laid plans, but over the longer term, the cream will rise to the top and the best compani will shine.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Still, sometim top stock also perform remark well for investor in the near term. Here are three exampl of compani that have doubl investor money -- not over five, 10, or 20 years, but in just three year time! $5,000 invest in these stock in 2014 would be worth $10,000 or more today. That' a result few invest are abl to replicate.Moreover, these aren't super-riskypenni stocks, but rather member of theS&P 500index, mean they'r among the biggest compani on the market today.1. Ulta SalonBeauti care and product are fashion statements, and no cosmet compani ha made a bigger or bolder statement in recent year thanUlta Salon(NASDAQ: ULTA) , which sell more than 20,000 product from 500 vendor at almost 1,000 stores. It ha becom the industri leader not just becaus it sell more stuff than the competition, but becaus it combin a broad select of product in a uniqu salon environ that can't be easili replicated, especi by onlin retailers.Whil e-commerc ha drain market share from ani number of bricks-and-mortar retailers, caus them to close store and shrink their squar footage, Ulta brashli proclaim it will maintain it breakneck expans pace. By the time it report it fourth-quart earnings, it will have open 100 net new store in 2016 and grown it squar footag by 11% over the prior year.Imag source: Ulta Salon.Cosmet is certainli a crowd space, and consum can purchas cheaper product from their local drugstores. The allur of the space ha even tempt fast-fashion leaderH&Mto enter the market with it own discount line. But when it come to person beauti care, consum are increasingli unwil to skimp on quality, and Ulta Salon' busi model of sell them in a salon set where profession beauti care specialist can provid instant advic and feedback is one reason it ha gener return total nearli 217% over the past three years.2. BroadcomTheBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) of today isn't the fabless semiconductor compani of year past. In 2016, it wa acquir by Singapore-bas Avago Technolog for $37 billion, which renam itself Broadcom Limited, but to spice thing up kept the AVGO ticker symbol. Onc the merger wa complete, it sold it entir Internet of Thing portfolio of product toCypress Semiconductorfor $550 million. Today, the result compani describ itself as ""a lead designer, develop and global supplier of a broad rang of digit and analog semiconductor connect solut that serv the wire infrastructure, wireless communications, enterpris storag and industri markets."" A full plate, to be sure.Imag source: Getti Images.Yet theReader' Digestvers of that is Broadcom is primarili a supplier of chip to smartphon and tablet producers,especiallyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which account for more than 10% of it sales, but also likelySamsung, which help explain whi it stock ha done so well over the past few years.Sinc 2014, Broadcom' stock ha return more than 276%, mean a $5,000 invest then would now be valu at almost $14,000, a near three-bagger.It success in the mobil market -- the compani is gener revenu of $13 billion annual -- meant that it could afford to sell off a small busi like it IoT portfolio (which made less than $200 million) without think twice, even as it rival are race headlong into the space. Be a key supplier to the mobil market should allow it to continu gener big returns.3.

Twilio stock ralli from it June IPO price of $15 to a high near $71 by September, onli to peel back to a low of less than $26 in January.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrSinc hit that low, TWLO stock ha gain more than 20% … right in front of the Twilio earn report due after Tuesday' close.Th conundrum: Twilio ha yet to trade base on ani semblanc of ""value."" It ha been and continu to be driven by a percept of potential, and that percept is alter on a pretti regular basis. Henc the big swing in just a few short months.Th good news is, Tuesday' Q4 earn report will like answer some of the question that investor have been ask about the company' future.Th bad news is, owner of Twilio stock may not like those answers.Twilio Q4 Earn PreviewTwilio, for those not familiar with it, ha turn cloud comput technolog into a robust telephoni and messag tool. Anyth an individu busi could want to do with, or through, a smartphon or app, TWLO can make it happen securely, en masse, via the cloud.9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99It' a rel young company, too. Twilio ha onli been in busi sinc 2013, and a publicli trade compani sinc the middl of last year.Revenu growth hasn't been a problem at ani point, though. For the quarter end in September, the top line of $71.5 million wa up 61% on a year-over-year basis, and estim for a top line of $74.2 million are 44% better than Q4 2015' sales.What ha been a sore spot, though, is earn - or a lack thereof. Twilio isn't profitable, and isn't expect to be anytim soon. Analyst anticip a loss of 5 cent per share on Tuesday, though that would be a slight improv on the 10-cent loss book in the same quarter a year earlier.3 Thing TWLO Stock Holder Need to Chew OnClearli Twilio stock is still a stori stock, rock more by rhetor and assumpt than by actual results. Result - rel result - will set the tone for the rhetoric, though, and that rhetor will larg be shape by three overarch ideas.In no particular order …An 'Even If' Valuation:Th market is mostli OK with the lack of earn thu far, and the unlikelihood of a swing to a profit in the forese future. As wa noted, the stori aspect of thi compani ha been more than compel enough to keep trade interested.They'r becom increasingli suspicious, however, that even if Twilio were to turn a typic 10% profit on it revenue, the valuat still make no sense. At it current annual revenu run rate of $290 million, $29 million worth of incom still doesn't make sens of the company' current market cap of $2.8 billion.It Relationship With Facebook:Th Twilio platform integr (quit nicely) with Messeng and WhatsApp, fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which account for roughli a fourth of the company' revenu now thatMesseng wa ad to the mix last year. But that' not guarante revenu go forward.A Pacif Crest Secur analyst Brendan Barnicleobserv follow the Q2 Twilio earn report:""Vari revenu ($8.1 million) wa down 14% sequenti and drop to 12.6% of revenu from 16%. While some investor may worri about the decline, we believ that it larg reflect the lumpi of revenu from WhatsApp, Twilio' largest custom and the main compon of variabl revenue.""Slow Growth/Outlook:A wa noted, trader had been will to pay a premium for TWLO stock becaus it red-hot growth rate presum would catch up with the stock' valuation, and even spur a profit. The anticip top line for it fourth quarter is bare better than it Q3 revenue, and even analyst that expect a top-lin beat aren't look for a big one - onli about $3 million.Here' How Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200To that end, Twilio need to serv up some plausibl Q1 and full-year (2017) revenu guidanc that' better than the current figur of $77.85 million and $352.6 million, respectively.Bottom Line for Twilio StockThough TWLO share may final look like they'r on the mend after pay the usual post-IPO price - a major setback - between Septemb and December, it' still a bit too soon to make such an assumption. The ralli sinc earli Januari may still be noth more than a relief ralli in the wake of amajor inflow of new TWLO stock that had been tie up until Decemb 22nd.The pressur remain on the compani to prove it worth.

"Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Sell Itself, But Probably Won’t",2/6/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsLess than two year after clear $50,Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) stock trade around $6. A seri of disastr earn report ha sent Fitbit stock tumbling. The most recent wa the disclosur of preliminari Q4 result last week, which impli a nearli 20% declin in sale year-over-year in the key holiday quarter.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitCompetit fromAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN), among others, appear to be a key problem for the company, particularli in the U.S. The result declin in growth ha had a substanti neg effect on FIT stock.That' not go to get better.Lately, Fitbit ha been compar toGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), anoth compani that drove explos growth mostli off a singl product onli to see sale nosedive. The question is whether in thi day and age, a single-product compani can support the expens necessari to compet with behemoth like Appl and Samsung. The answer, at least from Fitbit and GPRO, appear to be no.And that would seem to argu for a sale of FIT to one of those larger players. The problem for Fitbit stock investors, however, is that such a move seem unlik - at least befor it' too late.Whi FIT Should Sell ItselfIn respons to the lower demand in Q4, FIT is cut costs. It' lay off 6% of it staff, part of an overal effort to cut $200 million a year in oper expense. That' a substanti amount of savings, given that Fitbit stock ha a market cap under $1.4 billion at the moment.7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the MarketBut what' less import than what is be save is what' left: some $850 million in fiscal 2017, accord to the company. It' a huge amount of money for what, at it core, still is a single-product company. Yes, FIT is ad softwar to creat a ""platform"", and it product line goe beyond it most popular wearable. But compar to the diversif of an Appl or a Samsung, there' no comparison.Fitbit ha to build an expens base to support one product; it competitor (even Garmin) support multipl products. That matter not onli in term of cost, but in term of sales. It' easier for Appl to cajoleBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) to push the Appl Watch when Best Buy is also sell million of dollars' worth of MacBook and iPhones. FIT doesn't have that leverage, and expect it to compet with electron giant seem simpli foolhardy.A for the cost structure, even with the $200 million in reduc spend, FIT is guid for a loss next year. (That loss exclud the cost of stock grant issu to Fitbit executives, no less.) With one product, there' no abil to spread out expens for everyth from salespeopl to R&D to IT. FIT is like go to spend $240 million in 2016 just on sale and market - for one product!That expens rose 23% through the first three quarter - the cost of tri to be David against multipl Goliaths. But the stori seem like to end much more poorli for Fitbit stock.Whi Fitbit Stock Won't Sell ItselfFrom that standpoint, a sale of FIT stock to a larger player would seem to make sense. Apple, Samsung or Garmin all would make sense. The Fitbit brand remain strong, and an acquir almost certainli could cut hundr of million of dollar itself. A slimmer (pardon the pun) FIT would thu add a nice amount of profit, even assum a premium paid to acquir Fitbit stock.Ther are a coupl of problem with thi scenario. The first is that Fitbit stock ha a dual-class system. FIT is thu control basic by it two founder and ventur capit firm True Ventures. One of those founders, CEO Jame Park,saidin the releas accompani the preliminari fourth-quart figur that the compani simpli wa in ""a temporari slowdown and transit period"".A long as Park, along with True Ventur and co-found Eric Friedman, believ the weak is onli temporary, Fitbit won't sell itself. And if Park is wrong, and Fitbit is surpass by larger players, by then, it will like be too late.3 Reason Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than It Main PlatformAnoth issue, counterintuitively, is FIT' huge cash balance. The compani expect to have $700 million in cash at the end of Q4 - over half of it market capitalization. But that cash also limit the premium an acquir will pay for Fitbit stock. The enterpris valu at the moment - what the market say the busi is worth - is about $670 million. Assum Fitbit could get twice that price from an acquirer, it would have to sell itself for onli about $9.30 per share.So hope of a FIT acquisit rest, essentially, on the co-found of the compani agre to sell the busi for more than 80% less than it wa worth less than two year ago. That' a highli unlik outcome. Park and Friedman are go to believ Fitbit can turn around - it'stheircompany. They turn their idea into a busi worth over $10 billion not that long ago; it' silli to think they would then sell it for a bit over $1 billion at thi point.And mayb FIT can turn itself around, which would certainli drive upsid in Fitbit stock. But it seem a veri difficult path. While it' hard to think of a billion-dollar compani as a ""littl guy,"" Fitbit is a littl guy when compar to it competition. And in thi day and age, it' aw tough for the littl guy to go at it alone.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February10 Blue-Chip Stock That Could Be Hold You BackTh postWhi Fitbit Inc (FIT) Need to Sell Itself, But Probabl Won'tappear first onInvestorPlace."

Is Fitbit Inc. a Bear Trap or Bull Trap?,2/6/2017,"Share ofFitbit(NYSE: FIT) recent fell to an all-tim low after the fit tracker maker releas dismal fourth quarter preliminari earn and bleak guidanc for fiscal 2017. The compani now expect it fourth quarter revenu to fall 18%-20% annually, miss it prior guidanc for 4% growth and repres it first year-over-year declin sinc it IPO.Imag source: Fitbit.makeArticleAd();On the bottom line, it expect a non-GAAP net loss of $0.51-$0.56 per share, compar to it prior guidanc for a profit of $0.14-$0.18 per share. That' a big drop from it profit of $0.35 in the year-ago quarter, and repres it first unprofit quarter. Fitbit say it sold 6.5 million devic dure the quarter, which repres a 21% declin from a year earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin is also expect to be ""materi below"" it prior forecast of 46%, which alreadi repres an all-tim low.And that pain won't end anytim soon. Fitbit expect to gener just $1.5-$1.7 billion in revenu in fiscal 2017, which would repres a 26% declin (at the midpoint) and miss the consensu estim of $2.4 billion. It will also remain in the red with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.22-$0.44 for the year, well below expect for a profit of $0.64. Lastly, it announc that it would lay off 110 employees, or 6% of it workforce, to reduc it oper expenses.With number thi bad, it' easi to hate thi stock. But some contrarian investor might also argu that the stock ha fallen too fast and too far. Let' take a closer look at the bullish and bearish case for Fitbit, and see whi it could burn both sides.Whi Fitbit could be a bear trapFitbit ha been averypopular target for short seller over the past year. As of thi writing, 43% of it share are be shorted. But when short interest is that high,anyposit news about Fitbit -- a new product, aggress cost cut measures, or acquisit buzz -- could trigger a short squeeze.With an enterpris valu of $680 million and an EV-to-sal ratio of just 0.3, Fitbit is veri cheap. That make it a lucr buyout target forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Garmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) , or other compani look to expand into the wearabl market. By buy Fitbit, Appl could expand it wearabl reach beyond the Appl Watch,which failedto turn smartwatch into mainstream gadgets. Garmin could buy Fitbit to broaden it fit tracker portfolio and further diversifi it busi away from it weaker automot GP unit.Imag source: Fitbit.Fitbit ha also been diversifi it busi with mobil payment and it acquisit of Pebble' asset and Vector' smartwatch -- indic that it could soon creat feature-rich smartwatch tether to an app ecosystem. That ecosystem could bolster Fitbit' user loyalti figur while diversifi it top line. It could also sign more corpor well partnership to secur more bulk enterpris orders. Fitbit expect it financi perform to ""stabilize"" in the second half of 2017 as it reduc it oper expens (especi sale and marketing) by $200 million -- so the stock could bottom out soon.Whi Fitbit could be a bull trapHowever, the number all suggest that Fitbit is still struggl to carv out a nich between low-end rival likeXiaomi, sport perform challeng like Garmin, and high-end smartwatch maker like Apple. Fitbit is still the largest wearabl maker in the world with 23% market share, accord to research firm IDC.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200,2/6/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) deliv excel earn news Jan. 31 that push Appl stock to it highest level sinc the summer of 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat' great news for long time owner of Appl stock who'v had to suffer through a delug of naysay proclaim it lack of innovation. More than a few have even suggestedinvestor dump AAPL stockand buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in it place.Hey, I like Microsoft and I think what it'sdo in the cloudi go to help it continu to grow over the next decade, but it' not in the same leagu when it come to revenu and profit growth. Microsoft does, however, have a busi model that' transit from one-tim product sale to ongo monthli recur revenue, someth mani observ have note is happen at Apple.Yes, Appl did sell more than78 millioniPhon in the first quarter, roughli five million more than it sold in the same quarter a year earlier, but it wa the servic revenu that had everyon in a tizzy.Jim Cramer liken the Appl busi model toth Gillett busi model, where consum buy a singl razor and keep buy new razor blades; onli in Apple' situat the iPhon is the razor and servic such as the App Store are the razor blades.Y gotta love recur revenue. Cramer does:""What ha dog Apple' stock for ages, what ha kept it share price so low, at least in term of it valuation, is the 'Blackberry-ization' issue,"" Cramer said onMad MoneyFeb. 1. ""The notion that in the end, the iPhon is just a devic and devic compani eventu get wast asBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) did.""7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThere' no question recur revenu is good for a company' top and bottom line and should be welcom news for owner of Appl stock, but is it enough to drive Appl stock through it all-tim high of $134.54 and upward to $200?That' debatable.Whil Apple' servic revenu hit$7.2 billionin the first quarter, 18% higher than a year earlier, it' still onli 9% of the company' overal revenue, or 100 basi point higher than a year earlier.Bi comparison, Microsoft' second quarter saw it servic and other revenueincreas 29.7% to $7.5 billion. The onli problem with that for Microsoft is the gross margin are 40% compar to 67.5% for it product revenue, which account for 68.5% of it overal revenue.Y want your recur revenu gross margin to be higher than your product margins, not lower; becaus if that' the way the world is headed, both stock are look at lower profit in the future.Appl doesn't break down it gross margin between product and segments. Overall, it gross margin in Q1 2017 wa 38.5%, 160 basi point less than in Q1 2016. Microsoft' overal gross margin in it latest quarter wa 58.9%, consider higher than Apple's.That would seem to suggest Microsoft' in a better posit when it come to servic revenue. It is both grow thi aspect of it busi faster than Appl and make more from everi dollar of revenue. From thi perspective, Appl is doomed.A quick look farther down the incom statement, however, provid some clarity: Apple' oper margin in Q1 2017 wa 29.9%; Microsoft' Q2 2017 oper margin wa 25.7%, or 420 basi point less than Apple.Th biggest reason for thi difference: Microsoft spend about three time as much per year on research and develop as Appl does; Appl spent 4.7% of it revenu in the trail 12 month on R&D compar to 14.4% for Microsoft. And when you'r talk about billion of dollar of annual revenue, the differ add up quickly.Which bring us back to Apple' grow servic revenue: InvestorPlac contributor Brad Moon highlightedth posit of Apple' servic revenuerecently. A coupl of hi point stick out for me.Don't Bet Against the Dow Jone Industri AverageFirst, the App Store had $3 billion in revenu in Decemb - a record. Secondly, Appl paid out more than $20 billion to develop in 2016. Extrapol December' App Store sale over 12 month and you get $36 billion in revenue. Subtract $20 billion paid to develop in 2016 and that leav a gross profit of $16 billion and a gross margin of 44%, which is pretti darn healthi consid veri littl R&D is requir to keep that up and running.Can recur revenu take Appl stock to $200? I believ it can. When, however, is anoth story.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Big Buyout Deal That Could Crush Investors9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99The postHere' How Appl Inc.

It ha drop out of the top five smartphon vendor list, marketshar in China ha plummeted, the Googl exec ha jump ship and some analyst are valu the compani as low as $3.6 billion.What happen to Xiaomi and is it threat to Appl truli neutralized? Or are the troubl Chines tech giant' plan mere on hold?Xiaomi' Rapid RisePriv held Xiaomi wa found in 2010, releas it first smartphon in 2011 and rapidli gain popular in China. The compani offer high-qual in it smartphones, with low price -a combin that led to it be the top-sel smartphon brand in China by 2014.It came seemingli out of nowher to captur thethird place spot for worldwid smartphon salesthat year as well. The feat wa especi impress given that Xiaomi wa not sell it phone in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Googl andSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the compani want to expand into consum electron in general. That effort includ the inexpens Mi Band fit tracker that vault Xiaomi intosecond place worldwid for wearabl salesbi 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).Th compani pursu a strategi of invest in hardwar startups, buy into dozen of compani make everyth from smart light to headphon and TVs. While these product are not alway Xiaomi-branded, they are design to all work well together.It also ad softwar and servic to the mix.Chines CompetitionTh success of Xiaomi spur homegrown competition. Other Chines manufactur step up to the plate and follow Xiaomi' formula. However, they did a better job of market to increasingli demand Chines consum by charg a littl more but offer more strike designs. One of these compani -Huawei- wa good enough that Googlepartn with it to build the Nexu 6P smartphon in 2015. Xiaomi' phone seem lower qualiti than these competitor and rather than innovative, it design are often seen as be too similar to Apple's.At thi point, Xiaomi ha been leapfrog by it Chines smartphon rivals. While Xiaomi ha drop off the global top five smartphon manufactur list, China' Huawei,OppoandVivocurr hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi' ambit were an expans into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompani hire Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product manag - from Google.However, Xiaomi' U.S. push ha fail to materialize. There are dozen of product Xiaomi offer onlin through itsMi Store(which carri onli a fraction of Xiaomi' and it partner companies' gear), includ eight differ smartphon models, multipl smart TVs, VR headset and even a self-balanc electr scooter. U.S. custom are limit to be abl to buy a few set of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a batteri pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in move into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi ha taken advantag of China' rel lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasban from sell smartphon in Indiaa a result of a patent infring rule (it ha sinc resum Indian operations). If Xiaomi tri to push into the U.S. with it smartphon at thi point, there' a good chanc Appl and other tech compani would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against thi scenario, Xiaomi ha begun buy up patents. Last year,it purchas 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relat to area like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At thi point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalu at as littl as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plu smartphones, miss it initi goal of 100 million and then the revis goal of 80 million. It' refus to say how mani it sold in 2016, but that silenc speak volumes.Hugo Barra bail on the companya few week ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few month befor leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphon sale wouldn't impact the companybecaus it made no money on them:""Bas we'r give [handsets] to you without make ani money… we care about the recur revenu stream over mani years. We could sell 10 billion smartphon and we wouldn't make a singl dime in profits.""Th problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphon still account for 95% of the company' revenue. All those other product and servic just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told report not to expect Xiaomi to releas a smartphon in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reason Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than It Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junpost a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admit the compani had push ahead too fast, cut into it long-term growth, but say the worst is over.Th company' revenu target is RMB 100 billion (roughli $14.5 billion) -the same as it 2015 target.

"No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's",2/5/2017,"Last week, Brand Financ came out with itsannu list of brand valuations. In a somewhat shock finding, the consult group declar thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost it supremaci toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiari Google.Alphabet is a phenomen compani with a long track record of innovation, and the Googl brand is extrem powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same leagu as Apple' brand in term of total value.I Appl turn sour?Whil Brand Financ still rate Appl as the second most valuabl brand in the world, it appear to have a fairli neg view of the iPhon maker. Accord to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple' evangelist are begin to lose their faith. The snake queue of earli adopt have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Appl ha fail to maintain it technolog advantag and ha repeatedli disillus it advoc with tweak when materi chang were expected.Put simply, Appl ha over-exploit the goodwil of it customers, it ha fail to gener signific revenu from newer product such as the Appl Watch and cannot demonstr that genuin innov technolog desir by consum are in the pipeline. It brand ha lost it luster and must now compet on an increasingli level play field not just with tradit rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chines brand such as Huawei and OnePlu in the smartphon market, Apple' key sourc of profitability.A a result of thi assessment, Brand Financ reduc it estim of the Appl brand' valu by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estim Google' brand valu at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Financ cite Google' domin in search, among other things, to justifi the big increas in it brand value.Consum are pay more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance' declin opinion of the Appl brand is contradict by consumers' willing to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Appl report record quarterli iPhon sale of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the averag sell price (ASP) reach a new record of $695.The iPhone' ASP hit a new record last quarter. Imag source: Apple.In the same quarter two year ago, right after Appl releas the huge popular iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plus, the iPhone' ASP had surg 8% year over year, to $687. Apple' abil to continu grow that ASP over the past two years, despit face stiff foreign exchang headwind in both years, is a testament to the massiv valu of it brand.Indeed, the cost of high-qual smartphon is come down. Leav asid Samsung, sever Chines manufactur have becom known for design high-qual smartphon and sell them at near-breakeven price in recent years. Apple' abil to command a huge price premium over competitor -- which extend beyond smartphon to PC and (to a lesser extent) tablet -- indic that it brand is as strong as ever.Appl is a profit machineAccord to Brand Finance, Appl ha fail to maintain a technolog lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, mani tech pundit have argu in recent year that Samsung ha overtaken Appl in term of innovation.Assum that the two compani are on a rel even technolog footing, they should be abl to produc roughli similar earnings. However, that' not even close to be true.Last quarter, Appl bare retook the lead in term of smartphon shipment with 78.3 million, compar to 77.5 million shipment for Samsung,accord to Strategi Analytics. Yet Samsung' mobile-divis oper profit total just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple' oper profit wa more than 10 time higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basi -- or look just at the smartphon busi -- Apple' advantag is somewhat smaller. But ani way you slice it, Appl gener mani time more profit than Samsung. (In it most recent fiscal year, Apple' oper profit wa $60 billion, compar to about $10 billion for Samsung' mobil division.)If Appl doesn't have superior technolog rel to Samsung, it brand must be do most of the heavi lift to gener $50 billion of addit oper profit on an annual basis.

Apple Inc. Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business,2/4/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is primarili a hardwar company. Most of it revenu come from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. Beyond those key product categories, the compani gener meaning revenu from it Appl Watch famili of smartwatch products, as well as from the variou accessories, such as it well-receiv AirPod line of wireless earbuds.Appl music run on differ Appl products. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();However, one of the most excit part of the company' portfolio is the servic business, which the compani say ""includ revenu from Digit Content and Services, AppleCare, Appl Pay, licens and other services.""Thi segment ha been on a robust growth path for quit some time, with revenu here grow 10% in the company' fiscal year 2015 and then a whop 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the company' most recent quarter, it report that servic revenu wa up anoth 18% year-over-year.Thi isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolut terms. It gener more than $24 billion in the company' last fiscal year, make up more than 10% of the company' consolid revenue. To realli put it into proper perspective, servic wa Apple' second-largest busi by revenu in 2016 -- bigger than the iPad and Mac.On the company' most recent earn call, CEO Tim Cook made public the company' vision for servic over the next four years, and it' quit ambitious.Doubl revenu in just four years""Servic are becom a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenu to be the size of a Fortun 100 compani thi year"", Cook said.Cook then went on to say that Appl ""feel[s] great about thi momentum"" and that the compani aim to ""doubl the size of [its] Servic busi in the next four years"".Of course, what Apple' goal are and what happen aren't necessarili the same thing, but the fact that manag is will to put a growth figur out there -- a hard number that investor will now hold Appl account for -- speak to the company' confidence.What would a doubl of thi busi mean?Put simply, doubl the busi from the revenu level seen in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple' servic busi will be bring in about $48 billion. If Appl can get the busi to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point forward (perhap 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonder for Apple' longer-term revenu growth prospects.What' not entir clear, however, is how that growth will translat into increment profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Servic busi ishigherthan the corpor average, so an increas in Servic mix should help Appl on the gross profit margin front.That said, as Appl scale up it servic revenue, it will like need to drive up oper expens associ with the business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profit from a boost in services, the increment gross profit isn't all flow to the bottom line.At the end of the day, if Appl hit it growth target with respect to thi grow segment, it should be less depend on the iPhon and could ultim see earn multipl expans as software/servic compani tend to be valu more by investor than pure hardwar plays.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Donald Trump Target Share Buybacks Next?,2/4/2017,"Donald Trump. Imag source: Whitehouse.gov.Presid Donald Trump ha taken sever bold step sinc take office, but one area seem to be a bigger prioriti than ani other. Trump ha been adam about get American compani to invest in the U.S. by build factori and plant and hire American workers. In hi inaugur address, he declar that as a central theme of hi presidency, implor American compani to ""buy American and hire American.""makeArticleAd();Befor he even took the oath of office, Trump said he had struck a deal withUnit Technologies'Carri Industri to keep about 800 job in Indiana that were slate to go to Mexico. He pressur other manufactur like automak to keep job in the country, and may have influencedFord'sdecis to scrap plan for a new plant in Mexico.Onc in office, Trump back out of the Tran Pacif Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, and met with leader of the Big 3 automak to urg them to expand in the U.S.Whil those move may help curri the favor of Trump' base, their effect on invest in the U.S. is uncertain. The automak alreadi believ that the auto market is at it cyclic peak, as last year mark a record for vehicl sales, and they are therefor reluct to invest in new factories.Manufactur job have certainli declin over the past generation, but analyst tend to blame that on autom rather than outsourcing.Trump ha support tax break that would encourag compani to bring back money kept overseas. Some see thi as step one to get the compani to invest in American jobs. Other see it as prime the compani to use the money to buy back their own shares. Larri Fink, BlackRock founder and CEO and a member of Trump' ""President' Strateg and Polici Forum,"" recent warn that compani should onli engag in buyback ""when they are confid that the return on those buyback will ultim exceed the cost of capit and the long-term return of invest in futur growth.""Fink mention Trump by name twice in hi Jan. 24annual letter to CEOs, say in part:If tax reform also includ some form of reduc taxat for repatri of cash trap overseas, BlackRock will be look to companies' strateg framework for an explan of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S., and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be use simpli for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capit plan that appropri balanc return capit to sharehold with prudent invest for futur growth?Presid Trump ha indic an interest in infrastructur investment, which ha the dual benefit of improv overal product and creat jobs, especi for worker displac by technology.Fink went on to write that infrastructur invest is not a solut to autom take jobs, say ""busi will need to increas the earn potenti of the worker who drive returns, help the employe who onc oper a machin learn to program it.""Trump ha show himself commit to American jobs. We don't know if he will use hi bulli pulpit to tri to forc compani to forgo buybacks, but he might if he follow the logic that do so would result in the compani instead put the money to use in way that would boost American workers. Let' take a look at the issue.A Wall Street favoriteShar repurchases, orbuybacks, in which a compani buy share of it own stock, were onc illegal, as they were seen as facilit insid trade becaus a compani could act on inform not avail to the public. The SEC chang the rule in 1982, and sinc then, stock buyback have becom increasingli popular. Accord toHSBC, American compani have spent $2.1 trillion on repurchas over the last five years.Often call a form of financi engin by detractors, share buyback boost a company' earn per share, not by increas earnings, but by reduc the number of share outstanding. The pie is split among fewer shares. Investor to tend to cheer share buyback due to the lift they give to stock prices, but from a larger econom perspective, and possibl from Donald Trump' point of view, they may be the least effici form of spend cash.Imag source: Getti Images.Bi alloc money to buy back shares, busi are choos to spend profit on inflat earn per share instead of potenti invest in the long-term growth of the busi by open new plants, hire or train new workers, invest in research and development, or even acquir other companies. Unlik dividends, the other from of return capit to shareholders, buyback don't give money to current sharehold that can be reinvested, and they do not add market valu to the company, which is base in part on the number of share outstanding. In other words, no valu is be creat by repurchas in the aggregate. Share repurchas are controversi for a number of reasons, but their abil to dissuad compani from invest in long-term growth is certainli one of the biggest.How the pro do itWith interest rate especi low in recent years, mani compani have taken on debt, not to expand their businesses, but to reward sharehold with buybacks.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) founder Steve Job refus to pay a dividend, believ that it meant the compani wa out of ideas. He also didn't author share repurchases.Appl under Tim Cook, however, ha taken out $87 billion in debt to fund repurchases, reduc the share count by 1.3 billion in the process, and spend about $125 billion in the process. Part of the reason Appl ha done so is becaus much of it cash is park oversea and it want to avoid repatri taxes, but one could see the Trump administr cut a deal with the iPhon maker to reduc or elimin repatri tax if it agre to invest in job in the U.S.Apple, with nearli $200 billion overseas, ha been demand such an arrang for years, and could be will to invest some of that cash in the U.S. if the tax rate wa significantli reduced. Notabl FoxConn, it biggest supplier, said it wa consid open a plant in Pennsylvania that would employ 50,000 Americans. Appl is unlik itself to invest in domest manufacturing, but sinc FoxConn assembl iPhon and other Appl products, if it open a plant in Pennsylvania, it would mean that some Appl product would be made in America, though outsourc to a Chines company.Trump ha said he would like to make deal with corpor to bring some of their oversea cash back home, though that would like come with stipulations.Goldman Sachspredict Trump' tax and repatri plan would encourag more buyback as it free up cash for companies, but BlackRock' Fink scold corpor in hi recent letter for spend so much on buybacks.H note that the total thatS&P 500compani have spent on dividend and buyback in the last 12 month is greater than the oper profit they'v earned. With $5 trillion in asset under management, the Blackrock CEO' missiv attract attent on Wall Street, and if he get the President' ear, Trump could end up use the bulli pulpit to excori big busi for it excess buybacks.IBM's(NYSE: IBM) recent misadventur perhap best illustr the folli of buybacks. After outlin a goal in 2010 of reach $20 in earn per share (EPS) by 2015, Big Blue spent aggress on repurchas to pump up EP to meet that target, pour $70 billion between 2010-2014 into lower it share count. As a result, however, the busi suffered.Revenu at the tech giant ha now fallen for 19 quarter in a row, and the compani wa forc to step back from it $20 EP goal in 2014. In 2016, adjust EP wa just $13.59, down 9% from the previou year. In the meantime, IBM ha also slash headcount as the number of employe ha fallen by close to 100,000, sinc it peak in 2014, to 368,000. Consid Big Blue' decis to use profit to reward investor while lay off employees, the compani would seem to be a target ripe for Trump' ire.It' not just tech compani that are use thi tactic, as manufactur likeGM, Ford, andCaterpillarhav all been spend on share repurchas recently.Ani attempt by the Trump administr to tackl share repurchas would like rankl Wall Street, which favor the practice. But as the presid look for more lever to pull to boost the ""forgotten men and women"" of America, share buyback may start to look like a worthi target.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The drop coincid with the releas of the lower-pr iPhon SE, which start at just $399. After a late second-quart release, sale of the model seem to peak in the third quarter, result in a low $595 ASP for all iPhon units.Appl also face signific foreign exchang headwind over the past year. CFO Luca Maestri note the dollar ha strengthen 25% against the basket of currenc where Appl doe busi sinc June 2014. That led Appl to rais some of it price in foreign countri last year.But more iPhon shopper opt for the high-end iPhon 7 Plu last quarter, lead to a record ASP of $695. That' even more astonish consid the inclus of the iPhon SE in those sales.What' so tell about the popular of the iPhon 7 Plus?Unlik in the two previou Plu model of the iPhone, the 7 Plu includ a higher-end camera compar to it smaller-screen sister. That point of differenti may be what led more consum to opt for the more expens devic last quarter.Th signific demand for the 7 Plu show that Appl ha the potenti to drive sale growth by further differenti the Plu lineup from the standard iPhon model. Instead of just offer a larger screen, Appl can keep it best innov exclus for it highest-pay custom befor let them trickl down to the lower-pr models.Such a move would strengthen the posit of the Plu model in the simpl good, better, best price posit Appl uses. Just as importantly, the upsel is easi thank to instal plan -- just $4 more per month get you the best ever phone, camera, mobil game machine, Snapchat device, and so on.But don't get excit just yetThere' no doubt that Appl benefit from one of it biggest competitor run into some technic difficulti late last year.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) had to recal it Galaxi Note 7 after unit start randomli explod due to batteri malfunctions.Mani Note 7 custom like end up buy an iPhon 7 Plu for it similarli size screen.

That' whi investor must pay attent to the iPhon ASP go forward to see if last quarter wa a fluke or if Apple' differenti strategi is pay off.

3 Interesting Things We Learned From Snapchat's IPO Prospectus,2/3/2017,"Snap Inc., the parent compani of photo-shar applic Snapchat, recent file a prospectu with the SEC and is offici gear up for an initi public offering. Snapchat ha taken the social media landscap by storm sinc it debut in 2012, and with privat valuat hit nearli $25 billion, investor should be anticip what could be the biggest tech IPO of the year.Snapchat co-found and CEO Evan Spiegel, alongsid fellow founder and CTO Bobbi Murphy, will lead hi compani through thi import period. At just 26 and 28 year of age, Spiegel and Murphi are set to becom some of the wealthiest under-30 in the world after Snap Inc. debuts; just how much their net worth will swell depend on how big the company' IPO can get, and we got a better sens of thi size from it recent prospectu filing.(Also Read:Insid Snapchat: The Best Tech IPO of 2017?)The prospectu contain ton of juici information, includ key financi and membership data. For example, we learn that Snapchat now ha about 158 million averag daili activ user and it annual revenu swell to $404.4 million in 2016. We also know that Snapchat plan to list it share in March under the ticker ""SNAP."" The compani file for $3 billion debut, but thi is expect to be a placehold until Snap Inc. price the deal.Al of thi inform is import to know and understand as investor think about invest in Snapchat at it IPO. However, the juiciest detail in the prospectu were one that not everi investor expect to see or knew to look for. Check out these three key fact that you may have missed:1.It' a ""camera company"" … kind ofWhil most peopl would consid Snapchat a social media company, it prospectu proudli proclaim that ""Snap Inc. is a camera company."" In the sens that Snapchat is inher interest in it users' phone cameras, thi is a logic statement; however, Snapchat is certainli not-nor doe it seem interest in becoming-a major manufactur of camera-bas hardware.Sure, the compani recent debut it own line of camera-equip sunglass call ""Spectacles,"" but as it prospectu point out, 96% of revenu come from advertis and that is unlik to chang soon. Do you know ani other ""camera companies"" that reli on advertis revenue? Not really, which mean Snapchat' label of itself as a ""camera company"" is more about it focu on the import of the camera as a commun device, not it busi model.2.Mysteri third founder is goneThos who have follow Snapchat sinc it earliest day are probabl alreadi familiar with the impress leadership of Spiegel and Murphy. However, everi Snapchat-rel stori seem to includ a mention of Reggi Brown, Snapchat' mysteri third founder who reportedli came up with the idea of disappear photos.Whil we knew that Brown wa no longer at the company, the prospectu final reveal the full detail on the situation, and it is a classic case of ""hush money"" that resembl the Winklevoss-Zuckerberg fiasco. Accord to the filing, Brown su the compani over intellectu properti violat in Februari 2013. The parti involv eventu settl in Septemb 2014, with Snap Inc. agre to pay Brown about $158 million in cash.3.They know their competitionOn of the key element of a prospectu for a compani like Snap Inc. is the inform the compani share about it perceiv challeng within it own industry. In that regard, it is clear that Snapchat is acut awar of it competitor right now.Th compani underscor the danger of competitor that ""mimic"" Snapchat' featur throughout the report, and it use a rhetor of caution to describ the busi that challeng it.""Mani of our current and potenti competitor have significantli greater resourc and broader global recognit and occupi better competit posit in certain market than we do,"" the prospectu said, identifi FacebookFB, AppleAAPL, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, LINELN, Twitter (TWTR), and mani other as key foes.Fin DetailsStartup like Snapchat benefit greatli from keep their book close and oper under the cover of be private, but the era is nearli over for Snap Inc., and the compani will soon have mani new sharehold to please.Look ahead, we can expect a SNAP offer in March, and price detail should come closer to that time. Other than that, we know that SNAP will be list on the NYSE and some of the world' biggest banks, includ Morgan StanleyMS, Goldman SachsGS, JPMorganJPM, Deutsch BankDB, BarclaysBCS, and Credit SuisseCS, are work on the deal.Which Stock are Zack Expert Talk About?Stock in today' headlin may be tempt buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stock Zack expert recommend?

3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapses,2/3/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' often state by motiv speaker that the Chines word for ""crisis"" is compos of two charact - one signifi danger, the other opportunity. It' alsoembarrassingli inaccurate. Thi goe to show you that if the crux of an invest argument invok ""the Chinese,"" stop! You might be get had. Still, thi ""Chines philosophy"" is extrem relev for tech stock these days.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat' becaus semiconductor and digit commun giantQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is have a year to forget. Despit the fact that it' onli earli February, QCOM share are down 18.5% year-to-date. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm is trade firmli below it 50- and 200-day move averages. If someth substant doesn't happen soon, it risk repeat the disast of 2015, when QCOM lost nearli 31%.The disast that Qualcomm is current face wa seen well in advanc by those watch the industri closely. The crux of the issu is the company' technolog licens business. Thi is themost lucrativedivis for QCOM, account for the major of it profits. By ""sell the right to use patent that are essenti to all modern mobil phone systems,"" QCOM had a monopoly. That' an incred opportunity, so long as you don't get caught.Of course, they got caught. First, it was, you guess it - the Chinese. Regul in the world' second-biggest economi found Qualcomm guilti of violat theiranti-monopoli law. Then, individu compani began file complaints. Finally, the Feder Trade Commiss got involv in mid-January, claim that QCOM illeg maintain a monopoly. Share never look the same after that, and who know when Qualcomm will recover.Thos are question that analyst will squabbl over. But for rival tech stocks, they onli have one messag - better you than me. It' not just the fact that a major competitor is falling. Thi is a classic case where an enemi of an enemi is a friend. Furthermore, the benchmarkTechnolog SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) is up 4.6% YTD. Granted, these aren't the best numbers, but it' much more prefer than what Qualcomm is go through.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryWhil QCOM is swim with the sharks, here are three tech stock that are now set up to win big!Tech Stock That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Appl Inc. (AAPL)Click to EnlargeUndoubtedly, of all the tech stock that were affect by Qualcomm,Appl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stand to be the biggest winner.On Jan. 20, AAPL file suit against Qualcomm, alleg that the compani ""withheld $1 billion in rebat in retali for Appl cooper with Korean effort to open the radio chip market."" Although it' difficult to call a stalwart like AAPL a ""victim,"" the pattern of alleg is pretti damning.First, we alreadi saw Qualcomm violat foreign anti-competit laws, and pay dearli for it. Second, Korean manufacturerSamsung Electron Co. Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) alleg similar shenanigans, although they later back down. Finally, and most importantly, the FTC claim that Qualcomm forc AAPL to use their chip to prevent competitor encroachment. For Qualcomm, Applr is it biggest customer, so the potenti ramif are deep and wide.Of course, Cupertino isn't go to shed ani tears.Last October, AAPL ""report it first declin in annual sale and profit in 15 years,"" accord toTh Guardian. There are seriou concern that the king of consum tech stock ha reach peak popularity. Whatev it is, Appl need to boost it profitability. Get out of unfavor contract is a good start.And with the world seemingli against Qualcomm, AAPL ha an excel chanc of reviv itself at their expense.Tech Stock That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Intel Corpor (INTC)Click to EnlargeAlthough I believ that Appl will get the most benefit out of the QCOM fiasco,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) ha a strong case as well. I wouldn't be surpris if most peopl view it as a toss-up between the two titans.Among tech stocks, INTC is one of the most recognizable, but for the wrong reasons. Everybodi know the ""Intel Inside"" slogan, but the onli problem is that it relat to the age person comput business.It' a common challeng for consum tech stock - INTC need to find new blood. The company'srevenu growthisn't the most consist in the world. That' whi the partnership last year between Intel and AAPL wa a much-need step in the right direction. Up until that point, Qualcomm wa the sole provid of chip for the iPhone.In 2016, INTC step in to provid half the demand. Apparently, QCOM took except to thi arrangement; hence, the FTC charg of competit foul play.So far, the market respons toward Intel stock ha been mixed. Therefore, I still give the advantag to Apple. Nevertheless, encourag sign do exist. Yes, share are down 4% from it high of the year. However, it' still veri close to pariti for the year. Furthermore, INTC remain insid a bullish trend channel that began in late summer of 2015.7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the MarketTh collaps at Qualcomm just give other tech stock more options, and Intel is happi to help.Tech Stock That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO)Click to EnlargeWhil virtual all tech stock are affect by the Qualcomm crisis, few were as glu to their TV screen asBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO).A a semiconductor and commun compani themselves, AVGO is a direct competitor and rival to QCOM.Naturally, if your primari nemesi goe down hard, it rais the boat for everyon else. And Qualcomm is sink quit nice for the Singapore-bas firm.It' not just the fact that QCOM ha transit into the world' most hate stock. Nor is it the money that they'll have to dish out in penalties. Rather, Qualcomm will be forc to fundament chang it busi plan. If it doesn't, govern watchdog are on standby, eager to pounce. That just give AVGO and other a leg up. Mayb Broadcom is no saint. However, at the moment, the spotlight isn't on it, provid a margin of comfort.Most importantly, AVGO is make the most of it ""Chines crisis.""

AMD hasn't post an oper profit sinc the third quarter of 2014, hold a great deal of debt and yet trade at a stratospher valuation.Amid these high expect and gain worthi of bubbl talk, is AMD stock still a buy? Here are two problem that should have the bull take a second look.AMD Ha a Not-Great Balanc SheetDespit mani chipmak such as AMD go ""fabless"" and outsourc the fabric of their chip to contract manufactur such asTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM), the industri remain capital-intensive.7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the MarketAdvanc Micro Devic escap bankruptci last year. It took advantag of low interest rate and improv investor confid to restructur it debt in Septemb 2016. AMD issued$600 million in sharesand $450 million in convert senior notes. Thi enabl AMD to pay off $676 million in debt due in 2020. So instead of $600 million in AMD debt matur in 2019, onli $196 million will matur that year.Still, AMD is highli leverag by sever measures. With $1.435 billion in long-term debt and $416 million in sharehold equiti as of Dec. 31, 2016, AMD' long-term debt-to-equ ratio stand at 3.44. That figur is much lower for Intel, at 0.38, andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), at 0.37, indic less leverage. Likewise, AMD' debt-to-capit ratio of 0.775 stand abov 0.27 for both INTC and NVDA.Intel and Nvidia also are better abl to servic debt. For the year end Decemb 31, 2016, AMD gener onli $90 million in oper cash flow, with $2.9 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.031.NVDA earn $1.462 billion in oper cash flow for the four quarter end Octob 30, 2016, with $4.24 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.34.Intel show an even healthier balanc sheet, with $19.09 billion in oper cash flow for $48 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.396.AMD Stock Is Much More ExpensiveNvidia and Intel are profit and have a better track record of gener oper cash flow. They earn posit oper cash flow in the four most recent quarters, while AMD' oper cash flow went neg for two quarters.Still, AMD stock trade at a huge premium to both.AMD trade at a whop 25.66 time book, versu 11.5 for Nvidia (which itself is high), and 2.61 for Intel. It' not difficult to justifi a higher price than Intel given AMD' growth prospects, but for comparison' sake, know that while Wall Street see Advanc Micro Devic grow revenu roughli 10% thi year and next, NVDA should be sit at roughli 37% annual sale growth after it report Q4 earnings, with analyst expect that to slow to ""only"" 16% next year.ConclusionIt' difficult to fight the momentum, but you might just want to in AMD stock. At thi point, anyon tussl with Advanc Micro Devic is play with overpr fire.Should You Buy FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsFrom a valuat standpoint, INTC actual look like the best buy, simpli becaus the market expect less from it than from AMD and NVDA. Also, Intel lead in the product of microprocessors, and thi matter in the semiconductor industry, sinc often onli the market leader can turn a profit, while laggard destroy value.AMD made some mistak in the past, switch back and forth between ARM and x86 architectures, and never wa quit abl to catch up to Intel.

The action camera maker' bottom-lin figur beat the Zack Consensu Estim of 12 cent by an impress 33%.However, the earn figur wa a result of sever adjust made to the huge GAAP loss that GoPro report (82 cent per share).Shar tumbl almost 14% at one point in late trade in the aftermath of the results, as investor were disillus with the company' bleak sale outlook for first-quart 2017. Thi wa in spite of the fact that thi wa the second biggest quarter in term of revenu in GoPro' history. The drab guidanc must have spook investor as 2017 wa suppos to be a turnaround time for GoPro and thi is a terribl start to the same.In addition, investor were like upset with the multipl miss opportun and goof-up that GoPro had thi quarter.Th huge GAAP loss of 82 cent for the quarter wa much wider than the 25 cent loss gener in the compar quarter last year.For full-year 2016, the compani report a non-GAAP net loss of $1.44 per share, in stark contrast to net incom of 76 cent in 2015.Insid the HeadlinesGoPro' revenu grew 23.8% from the prior-year quarter' talli to $540.6 million. Thi mark the company' return to revenu growth after four success quarter of sale declines. The top-lin figur still lag the Zack Consensu Estim of $576 million.Thi wa the first quarter that reflect the perform of the recent launch Hero5 camera and it consum drone Karma, and revenu were far short of the company' earlier guidanc of $625 million. The Karma recal hit the top line and manufactur issu relat to Hero5 camera also strain growth.Nevertheless, Hero5 Black wa the best-sel digit imag devic in unit and dollar in the U.S. and Europe. Also, Hero5 Black sold more unit in a singl quarter in Europe, in thi quarter, than ani other GoPro camera ever.For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin expand 990 bp year over year to 39.5%. Non-GAAP oper incom came in at $31.6 million, as against an oper loss of $21.6 million gener last year.R&D expens were up almost 40% year over year, driven by invest in HERO5 cameras, Karma, accessori and software. In addition, sale and market expens shot up 36% year over year.Th compani recent launch GoPro Plu - a cloud-bas subscript servic - that enabl auto-upload of footag from a GoPro camera to a GoPro Plu cloud account for on-the-go access, edit and share use a smartphon and the Quik app. Even though it is earli days, the GoPro Plu is enjoy high retent rate in the U.S. and it subscrib base seem to be expanding.In the quarter, the rebrand Quik mobil app wa download over 4 million time (up almost 30% sequentially), as it activ user and monthli export tripl in Dec 2016 over the prior year.For full-year 2016, revenu plung 26.8% year over year to $1.62 billion.Not DevelopmentsTil date, GoPro' Hero 5 Black camera and Karma drone have face product issu and delay shipments, which restrain the company' abil to meet demand in the quarter. The company' new product also had a rocki start with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, as GoPro had temporarili stop sell them on the e-commerc site in mid Octob due to a price dispute.Further, suppli constraint made retail cancel market support of GoPro' new products, particularli it new Hero 5 camera, which obvious hurt revenues. Further, the compani had to announc a recal of it new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of it commerci launch, as a few of them lost power dure flight due to batteri issues. Thi wa also a huge setback for the company.However, earlier thi week, the compani resum Karma sale and the compani plan to ramp product further. Karma is schedul to be avail in intern market thi spring. We believ that GoPro is well set to capit on the fast-grow consum drone market.Th compani also launch sever accessori dure the quarter, includ Karma Grip, a handheld stabilizer; Remo, a waterproof, voice-activ remot and Quik Key, a microSD card reader enabl quick edit and share from smartphones.LiquidityExit the quarter, the compani had cash and cash equival of $192.1 million, down significantli from $280 million a year back.GuidanceIn light of such unfortun event and uncertain market reaction, the compani gave a veri disappoint guidanc for first-quart 2017. It project revenu for the current quarter in the rang of $190-$210 million, which is well below the Zack Consensu Estim of $268 million for the quarter. The compani expect gross margin in the low 30% range.GoPro refrain from offer specif revenu or margin guidanc for full-year 2017.However, GoPro declar plan to limit it adjust oper expens in 2017 to $600 million, in an attempt to tri to return to full-year profit next year. Thi is compar to a 2016 figur of about $709 million.GoPro should be abl to attain these massiv cost reductions, in light of it recent busi restructuring, which did away with mani high-cost oper includ it entertain division.It is like that GoPro' sale will gradual improv as it ramp product and expand Karma' reach to intern markets. Thi will supplement it cost-reduct initi and enabl it to achiev sustained, profit growth.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIn recent months, the compani ha been grappl to achiev it earlier growth and go beyond it trademark action cameras. GoPro had earlier reduc it inventori of older legaci cameras, in order to prepar for it new products. However, what follow wa more oper stumbl and messed-up product launches.Th compani ha also been face pressur to establish a more mainstream market for it cameras.

Import to add that thi quarter had an extra weekend in the report period, mean overal revenu growth wa rather stagnant.With ani company, but especi the largest U.S. market cap compani such as AAPL, the law of larg number certainli begin to appli when project futur growth. With Appl now trade at the highest price/sal ratio (and the first time over 3) in the past year, investor are pay a hefti compar price for AAPL stock.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryA P/E compar paint a similar picture, with AAPL stock now trade abov a 15 multiple.Technically, AAPL stock definit look toppi at the $130 level.

Thi wa a major area of resist back in the first half of 2015 as well.Appl is also extrem overbought, with a 14 day RSI well over 80. Previou instanc when AAPL wa thi overbought prove to be signific short-term top in Appl stock. Yesterday' price action, with the stock trade higher onli to revers and close lower on the day, also point to exhaust in the rally.Whil I am not look for a dramat pullback in AAPL stock, I also think the ralli ha gotten more than a littl ahead of itself. A period of sideway consolid price action is like in store.On of the benefit of option is that you can structur a trade to make, as Dire Strait famous said, money for nothing. So to posit for AAPL to struggl to head higher over the next month, a short-term bear call spread make intuit sense.AAPL Stock Trade IdeaBuy May $145 call and sell May $140 call for a 60-cent net credit or better.Trad of the Day: AK Steel Hold Corpor (AKS) Stock Look Like a BargainMaximum gain on the trade is $60 per spread with maximum risk of $440 per spread.

The Touch Bar is an OLE strip that replac the laptop' function key with a programm touch display, with virtual button base on the applic current be run. It also incorpor a fingerprint reader.And the Touch Bar is power by the T1, Apple' first ARM-bas Mac chip.New ARM CPU in Macs?Bloombergi now report thatAAPL engin are take the next step toward ARM in Mac, by have the ""Power Nap"" mode control by an ARM chip. Power Nap is a featur that let Mac laptop run basic background function such as retriev e-mail and instal softwar updates, while close and sleeping. By shift control of Power Nap from the Intel CPU to an ARM chip, less power is use and MacBook batteri would last longer.Whi the excit about the possibl of Appl make a complet switch and replac Intel processor with ARM CPU in Macs?ARM in Mac: The PayoffsTher are mani compel reasons, includingthos laid out last yearbi theMacObserver. ARM chip power all of Apple' mobil devices, so switch to ARM CPU in Mac would simplifi and unifi code develop between MacO and iOS.10 Compani That Are Bring Job Back to AmericaIntel ha move away from tick-tock processor develop cycles, so it may not be move forward fast enough for Apple' needs. Modern, 64-bit ARM processor are becom competit with Intel on power, includ the power need to run an oper system like Window in a virtual environment; therefore, ARM in Mac wouldn't have to mean Mac lose the option to runMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.Then there' cost. In a post date back to 2015AppleInsiderbrok down thepotenti financi gain should Appl ditch Intel. It estim the cost of the A-seri chip use in the iPhon and iPad at roughli $25, while Intel CPU use in Mac were somewher in the $180 to $300 range.Th site point to the Appl TV as an exampl of Appl make the switch. The first gener ran a version of OS X on Intel processors. For the second generation, AAPL switch to an ARM-bas A4 chip run iOS. That move shrunk the Appl TV size and knock the price from $299 to $99. The number may have chang a littl sinc then, but the same basic math applies: ARM is consider cheaper.Wil Appl Ditch Intel?Ther would be mani risk in switch to ARM CPU in Macs.

Apple Inc's iPad Business Isn't as Bad as It Looks,2/3/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) report a strong quarter, driven by better-than-expect demand in it key product line, the iPhone. However, while investor often pay far more attent to the iPhon busi than to ani of the company' other segments, it' import to watch the other nonetheless.Apple' 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That includ the iPad business.Appl report a 19% year-over-year drop in iPad unit shipment and a full 22% year-over-year drop in iPad revenue, make it the company' worst-perform busi unit by far. Although these result are quit disappoint -- make it increasingli difficult to have confid in the futur of thi product line -- the busi isn't in as dire shape as it appears.Channel inventori dynamicsIn Apple' most recent quarter, it ship 13.08 million iPads, down from 16.12 million in the same period a year ago. One of the driver of the steep year-over-year drop wa channel inventori dynamics. Rememb that Appl ship product to distributor (i.e., channel partners), and then those distributor sell those product to end customers. To get a true sens of underli custom demand, it' import to not just watch the chang in unit shipment but the amount of inventori that' sit out there in the hand of Apple' channel partners.With that in mind, Appl say that in the most recent quarter, the companyreducediPad channel inventori by 700,000 units. The compani say that in the year-ago quarter, Appl hadboostedit channel inventori level by 900,000 units.So to get a sens of the underli demand, we can adjust the number to account for the channel inventori changes. Appl ship 13.08 iPads, but channel inventori were down 700,000 units, which suggest that actual demand wa more like 13.78 million units. Perform the same math for the year-ago quarter, Appl increas channel inventori by 900,000 units, mean that underli custom demand wa 15.22 million units.To be clear, demand wasstilldown year-over-year and that' far from ideal, but adjust for these channel inventori dynamics, it look like the declin wa ""just"" 9.4%.Product cycl dynamicsAnoth factor that impact the iPad results, at least accord to CEO Tim Cook, were product cycl dynamics.On the earn call, Cook explain that in the year-ago quarter, Appl had just launch it 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which he remind investor is ""the iPad with, obviously, the highest price on it"".""W would have done the channel fill plu the launch of the product, and so that would have bolster [averag sell prices] in that particular quarter"", Cook said.Indeed, Appl report that in addit to iPad unit be down 19%, iPad revenu wa down 22% in the most recent quarter, suggest a weaker product mix. Cook' commentari absolut make sens here, especi as demand for the 12.9-inch model is probabl well below where it wa when it first launched.Look aheadOn the call, Cook tri to reassur investor that the compani ha ""some excit thing come on iPad"" and that he is ""veri optimist about where [Apple] can take the product"".Unfortunately, Appl manag ha been bullish about the iPad busi for a while now, but it' still hard to see where the bottom will ultim be and even harder to predict how much the busi can grow onc it hit that bottom.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Other tailwind includ the promis of corpor tax reform and repatri of foreign cash under Presid Trump, which disproportion benefit the tech sector, Rosenbluth point out.Appl CFO Luca Maestri note at Tuesday' earn call that 94% of hi company' record $246.1 billion cash pile is stash abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhon maker could potenti bring home foreign earn at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the singl biggest catalyst for the sector go forward, CFRA analyst say.Risk to the sector includ the uncertainti surround Trump' vision for econom renewal, the crimp that a strengthen dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rival such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investor who remain bullish on the sector' outlook have four dozen ETF to choos from. Mani of the new launch make extrem focus bet in extrem small industri nich - 3D print or Big Data or wearabl devices, for example.In Rosenbluth' view, most investor would do well to stick with a technolog ETF offer broadli diversifi exposur to the sector, and to then layer on themat ETF in specif tech industries.Investor have been seek diversification. Two tech ETF far outpac their peer last year by gather more than $1 billion apiec in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedli differ approach to invest in the sector.Vanguard Inform Technolog (VGT) track a market-cap-weight index of U.S. tech companies, includ more small- and microcap stock than most other broad tech ETFs.

At 0.60%, it expens ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investor should be awar that ETF may sound alik but offer veri differ exposures, which affect their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearli doubl the gain of it Vanguard peer. It benefit in part from it extrem overweight to the semiconductor industry.Look ahead, Rosenbluth believ VGT may benefit more than other broad-bas peer from an improv U.S. economy, given it larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on thestock marketon Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategi Use 10 ETF To Deliv All-Weath Incom With Low Risk7 Best ETF For Your Growth And Incom Need As Trump Take The Wheel"

4 Stocks That Are NOT Driven by the Trump Trade,2/3/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAnyon who ha been watch the market for the past two month know the far-reach impact Presid Trump ha had on stocks, bond and currencies. Stock indic soar to all-tim highs, bond price drop to 52-week low and the valu of the U.S. dollar climb to high last seen dure the financi crisis.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf it seem like all sector of the market were touch by the election, they were. Presid Trump' campaign promises, if enacted, have the abil to reach everi corner of the stock market.Hi promis chang to the busi tax code would impact everi business. Hi promis chang to the person incom tax code would impact nearli everi consumer. Hi promis infrastructur spend would increas inflat for the entir nation. Hi promis chang to the Afford Care Act (ACA) would impact nearli everi employee. Hi promis relax of govern regul would affect nearli everi employer. The list goe on and on.Look at the market through thi lens, there is not a compani or stock that will not be impact in some way by the Trump presidency. However, not all compani will be impact to the same extent. Some compani are more vulner - for good or bad - to the promis polici chang than others.For instance, larg bank and other financi institut - likeGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - have been the unriv beneficiari of a Trump presid up to thi point, becaus so mani of the president' suggest chang benefit the banks' bottom lines. Rise inflation, lower corpor tax and decreas regul all benefit the banks.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryConversely, biotech compani - likeBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) - have struggl in the aftermath of the presidenti elect becaus the uncertainti swirl around what will eventu replac the ACA after the Republican-control Congress repeal it, coupl with the pointedTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and interview critic Presid Trump ha issu regard the high price of pharmaceut and other medic treatments, ha creat a tremend amount of uncertainti in the healthcar industry.So which compani are less vulner to the potenti polici chang and polit whim of the president?Whil it' import to note that no compani is immun from the potenti threat of a target Twitter tirad from the presid should it happen to draw hi ire, there doe seem to be a group of stock that could bullishli go on it merri way dure the first half of 2017 without have to look over it shoulder everi morn to see if some new polici decis may threaten to derail it progress: the ""FANG"" stocks.Th FANG stock -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) [formerli Google, henc the ""G""] - have been Wall Street darl for the past few years. The shift consum have made to live in an onlin world for everyth from their social network to shop ha push the valuat of these compani ever higher as trader bet on thi trend continuing, regardless of what els happen in the economy.Th FANG stock took an initi hit after the result of the presidenti elect were announc in earli November, as trader start take profit on some of their more lucr posit and rotat that money into the financi sector and other sector that were pois to ralli follow Presid Trump' win. Nobodi wa doubt the strength of the FANG stock - they just need to free up cash to invest in even hotter stock at the time.Onc the initi rotat wa complete, investor start come back to the FANG stocks, which were then trade at much more favor valuations, and start buy them up. After all, whatev happen to inflation, whatev happen with the tax code, whatev happen with health care, consum are go to continu connect with friend on Facebook, buy more stuff on Amazon, watch video on Netflix and search for inform on Google.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Firework SoonW expect the FANG stock and other tech stock like them - stock likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - to continu to do well dure the next few months. We will certainli have to keep watch what the Trump administr doe in the futur (watch the net neutral debat is go to be especi import for NFLX), but the trader on Wall Street aren't go to abandon their perpetu winner just yet.InvestorPlac advisor John Jagerson and S.

"More iPhones, Less Profit",2/2/2017,"After three quarter of declin revenu and iPhon sales,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) manag to return to growth dure it first fiscal quarter. Not onli that, Appl put up some record numbers. Revenu wa $78.35 billion, up 3.3 % year over year and a new quarterli record. EP grew 2.4% to $3.36, also a new quarterli record.iPhon unit sale surg 5% to 78.3 million, the most ever in a singl quarter. The compani also set all-tim revenu record for services, Mac, and Appl Watch. There wa a lot to like.Appl stocksurg the follow day, with investor reliev that fear of a continu slide in sale were overblown.Whil Appl put togeth a fine quarter, the company' result aren't quit as good as they seem.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Apple.A profit declineAppl manag to grow it per-shar earn dure the first quarter, but a quick look at the incom statement reveal a differ story. Appl increas it revenu by $2.48 billion compar to the first quarter of last year, but cost of sales, the cost of produc it products, surg $2.73 billion. Gross profit declin by a littl less than 1% as a result.So Appl sold more devices, but it accept a lower gross margin, and none of that extra revenu flow through to the bottom line. Thi gross profit declin and a 9% increas in oper expens led oper incom to drop 3.4%. Net incom slump by a smaller 1.6% thank to an increas in other income, which includ incom for interest and dividends, among other items.Appl wa abl to grow it EP becaus of it expans share buyback program. The company' dilut share count declin by 4.8% year over year, fuel by billion of dollar of share buybacks. Appl spent $10.9 billion on share buyback dure the first quarter alone, an 57% increas compar to the prior-year period.To be fair, Appl still gener $17.9 billion of net incom dure the quarter, a stagger sum. But the fact that profit and revenu are move in opposit direct should be a concern for investors. There' noth wrong with share buybacks, especi when cash continu to pile up. But they'r the onli reason Appl wa abl to set an EP record.An extra weekDid you know that Apple' first quarter thi year had 14 weeks, compar to 13 week in the first quarter last year? If you onli read Apple' press release, thi fact may come as a surprise. Amongst all the talk of records, there' no mention of the extra week. You would have had to delv into the 10-Q or listen to the confer call in order to find recognit of thi substanti tailwind.If you just take the number and adjust them for thi extra week, the quarter doesn't look so good. Revenu would have slump 4.1%, iPhon unit sale would have declin 2.8%, and oper incom would have tumbl 10.3%. Thi is a simplist way to adjust for the extra week, as sale weren't spread out uniformli throughout the quarter. But it give a sens of how signific an extra week can be.Dur the confer call, CFO Luca Maestri point to four factor that offset thi extra week. Slower growth of China inventory, an earlier launch of the iPhon 7 compar to the iPhon 6s in the previou year, a stronger U.S. dollar, and a patent infring payment in the first quarter of last year all hurt the company' result rel to the prior-year period.Maestri doesn't say by what degre these factor offset the extra week, and in the absenc of an extra week, they would have read like a list of excuses. Adjust for that extra week, Apple' first quarter wasn't as solid as the headlin number suggest. It almost certainli wasn't as bad as my simplist calcul above, but it put an asterisk next to Apple' numbers.Th good news for Appl investor is that the company' guidanc for the second quarter wa positive. Appl expect to produc between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion of revenue, up from $50.6 billion dure the second quarter of last year. Gross margin is expect to decline, which will again pressur Apple' bottom line. But the major sale declin of the past few quarter appear to be in the rearview mirror -- at least for now.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple's Biggest Growth Engine (Services) Coming of Age,2/2/2017,"While iPhon return to growth is good news of course, it' evid that the busi ha lost momentum. Penetr level have increas significantli with the scope for further innov shrink with each new product generation. So user not just in tradit market but also in some emerg market have less of a reason to upgrade.Sinc AppleAAPLsel a high-end product, it market is further limited. So a jump in the holiday sale doesn't excit me as much as the fact that the number of iPhon user increas double-digit dure the quarter. Becaus it is the instal base of over a billion activ devic that Appl can count on to use it servic and gener recur revenu for the company.What Servic Did Thi QuarterApple' servic revenu grew 13.4% sequenti and 18.4% year over year to around $7.2 billion. Manag said that growth would have been higher take out the one-tim receipt of $548 million in the year-ago quarter and adjust for the extra week of sale in December. Thi is the fourth straight quarter that servic grew strong double-digit and contribut an equal or greater share of revenu than both Mac and iPads, make it the second most signific segment behind iPhones.At just 9% of revenue, Appl howev ha no legal compuls to provid too much detail on what thi busi is about. It doe offer interest tidbit though such as the paid subscript number that wa over 150 million in the last quarter.Consequently, servic includ a motley crowd, the chief of which is the App Store. Thi busi ""broke all-tim record dure the holiday quarter, includ $3 billion in purchas in Decemb alone, make it the App Store' singl best month ever,"" in the word of CEO Tim Cook. Over 2.2 million develop are current work on app for the App Store and payment to develop have now top $60 billion.So it isn't surpris that both the averag revenu per custom account and the number of custom account grew strongly. Appl also quot App Anni as say that App Store revenu more than doubl Googl Play revenu in calendar 2016. Anoth posit about thi busi is that it isn't geograph limited, mean that even a soft market like China is current contribut to sales.Appl Music grew for the third straight quarter as Appl enabl download in addit to the stream business. It ha had good luck with exclus content to date and is current look at origin content to further push things.Appl Pay user tripled, transact volum jump 500% run into the billion of dollar as the servic expand to Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain. Nearli 2 million small busi are accept payment through Appl Pay.AppleCar is close link to the growth in the instal base, so it continu to grow strongly.iCloud storag servic are do well, and that' all that Appl will say about it.Why' Thi So Important?It' hard to overst the import of thi segment as mobil comput devic race to their satur point. Devic sale overal are come down and what littl growth is there today will be gone tomorrow. Upgrad will be fewer and sale will depend on the abil to take market share.Th other reason is profitability. Manag say veri littl about the margin profil and make sure we understand that there are mani part to thi busi that don't gener the same margins. But they also say that the segment carri higher margin than the rest of the business.Thi make perfect sens sinc hardwar gener carri lower margin than softwar that is increasingli offer as a servic these days. So as the mix of thi busi grows, it will fetch stronger margin for Apple.Also, while Appl ha success convinc custom it devic are worth the money, hardwar innov hasn't been that great in recent time and could get more difficult go forward.

What's Next for iPhones After Strong Holiday Quarter?,2/2/2017,"AppleAAPLshar jump over 6% yesterday after the compani return to growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. A lot of the optim wa on account of iPhon sales, which grew 4.7% from last year to the highest ever talli of 78.3 million unit or around two-third of total sales. Street estim vari between 77-78 million units.Appl Inc. Price and EP SurpriseAppl Inc. Price and EP Surprise|Appl Inc. Quote""iPhone' Best Perform for Over a Year""Neil Mawston, Execut Director at Strategi Analytics, said in a statement that thi wa the iPhone' best perform in over a year, put it back on top as the world' largest smartphon vendor. But he also said that the number were help by the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. As a result, Samsung didn't see as much of the fourth-quart bump-up as it usual doe (it still manag a 29% share in the U.S. compar to Apple' 31%, accord to Kantar Worldpanel).Apple' growth rate wa also slightli lower than in the year-ago quarter, and wa like impact by the stronger dollar and by stiff competit from local player in China like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, OPPO and Vivo that may have led to a loss in market share. Revenu from China were down 12% in the last quarter. Tim Cook use an optimist tone: ""I'm encourag with the signific improv but we'r not without challeng there.""H also said that sale would have been stronger if demand for the more expens iPhon 7 Plu hadn't been underestimated. As it turn out, the more expens devic wa more popular base on new featur like better camera and more RAM, which therefor led to a suppli shortage. If it wasn't such a competit market, thi may not have been such a bad problem to have.However, it doe revers an earlier trend that saw the iPhon 6S Plu and iPhon 6 Plu grow slower than their less expens partners. It also seem to indic that custom are unwil to upgrad without meaning new features, but will pay more for them when they'r there.A a result, the two new model that also came with water resist while ditch the headphon socket account for 17% of iPhon sales, accord to research firm Localytics, as report in the media. Thi also rais the averag sell price to $695 from $691 in the year-ago quarter.Th Good and Bad Go ForwardSmartphon sale growth rate are not go to come back to where they'v been the last few years. For example, consid that the iPhon 6 launch in Sep 2014 wa follow by a 46% increas in shipment the follow quarter. Thi kind of growth is history, becaus penetr continu to increas across the world.Second, Apple' growth rate have also been fuel by market share gain in China, which may not be repeat for a number of reason includ greater penetration, the stronger dollar, a more difficult oper environment, the increasingli strain relat between China and the U.S. and the abund suppli of local make of vari price tags.Third, Appl is like to maintain or even grow share in develop market and market with higher penetr on the strength of it brand. But these upgrad will be depend on innovation. Tim Cook says: ""The smartphon is still in the earli inning of the game,"" and ""I think there' lot more to do... We'v got some excit thing in the pipeline. I still feel really, realli good about it."" But if the upgrad over the past two year are anyth to go by, it seem that there' a limit to that innovation.That of cours bring us to the question of the upcom iPhon 8 that is expect to have an all-new design, glass case and other excit features. Plus, it' the iPhone' 10thanniversary, so there' some pent-up excit there. If Appl deliv in line with the hype, it should have blockbust sales. Begin in the Septemb quarter when it will launch that is and provid Appl doesn't under-suppli the things. Until then, we should expect custom to hold off purchas (more so than in earlier year becaus the excit for the new phone is more thi time).Th other somewhat posit factor is India where Apple' talk with govern offici appear to be go well. India is a faster-grow market than China at the moment becaus of rel lower penetration, a rise middl class and the Prime Minister' state goal of digit the nation. Onc Appl start build it store in the region, it brand valu is bound to appreci and translat into increas sale for the company. But it' not a done deal yet, especi consid the concess Appl is ask for, so some uncertainti persists.Appl share current carri a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Biz,2/2/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) saw some great movement back in 2013 when activist investor Dan Loeb deliv ahand-written letterto CEO Kazuo Hirai. In that letter, Loeb, petit for Soni to spin off it entertain division, which includ movies, televis and music. Loeb believ the move would increas the valu of Soni stock and reward sharehold … and anoth weak quarter for the divis make that memori all the more painful.makeArticleAd();Source:WikipediaLoeb ha sinc sold hi stake, after be the largest sharehold with 6% of shares, but new rumor see Soni sell off part of the unit. SNE stock is readi to roll in 2017 if thi move final come into play.TheNew York Postreport that Soni is listen to pitch from interest parti in the Soni Entertain division. Rumor seeCB Corporation(NYSE:CBS), a Chines media company, or a technolog compani likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) acquir thi asset from Sony.An outright sale of the divis that includ movi and televis would differ from Loeb' origin plan, which call for the entertain unit go public and includ Soni Music.On Thursday, Soni report a weak fiscal third quarter due to the movi division. SNE lost $913 million in the pictur divis - thank to a $962 million write-down - bring Q3 profit down to $169 million. Even without the one time event, the divis wa veri weak compar to last year' third quarter, which thrive thank to the Jame Bond installmentSpectre.Whi a Soni Entertain Sale Could Still WorkThos result aside, though, the Soni Entertain divis is incred valuabl in today' content monet world. The compani creat movi and televis seri - and natur could produc more - that would fit well for mani acquir companies. Within Sony, thi divis often is buri under a focu on video games, televisions, and smartphon technology.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruarySN ha struggl to produc high box-offic gross from it movi division, but that could chang with it 2017 lineup. Thi year, the studio will releas sequel to movi likeTrainspottingandSmurfs. The studio will also releas a remak ofJumanji, with a promin Dec. 22 open date. Along with theSmurfs: The Lost Village, Soni is bet on it anim offer with other titlesTh Emoji MovieandTh Staralso come in 2017.While some report say Soni is wait to sell the divis until it see how strong the open ofTh Emoji Movieis, I have to believ that they are wait for anoth small movi come out on Juli 7. You might have heard of it. It' calledSpider-Man: Homecoming. Soni ha had better luck in term of overal box offic revenu and market share in year when a Spider-Man movi ha been released.Thi could be the perfect time to monet the entertain divis for the compani and reward owner of SNE stock.In2016, Soni held onli an 8.3% market share of the U.S. box offic with $943.5 million gross from 36 movies. Thi wa the highest number of movi releas among the main studios. Soni rank well behindWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS),Tim Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX),NBC/UniversalandNew Corp's(NASDAQ:NWSA) Fox, who all gross more than $1.5 billion domest dure the year. Onli two Soni movi (GhostbustersandAngri Birds) gross more than $100 million domestically.Thi ha been a common theme, and also one of the reason whi the entertain divis is so unpredict for a larg technolog compani like Sony. In 2015, the studio bare clear $1 billion thank to two decent-perform movi inSpectreandHotel Transylvania2.A Big Lineup AheadA mention above, releas a Spider-Man movi ha been a good thing for SNE and could lift Soni stock soon.Back in 2014, Soni finish fourth with a market share of 12% and $1.3 billion domestically.Th Amaz Spider-Man 2gross $202.9 million domest and anoth $506.1 million internationally. In 2012, Soni rank second at the box offic with a 16.5% market share and $1.8 billion in domest box offic revenue.SkyfallandTh Amaz Spider-Manl the way with $291 million and $262 million, respectively.Th Amaz Spider-Mangross an addit $496 million in intern markets.Along with a strong 2017 planned, Sony' movi divis is also releas addit Spider-Man movies,Bad Boy 3,Bad Boy 4,Hotel Transylvania 3,Goosebump 2,Barbieand more anim movies. Other intellectu properti own includ Charlie' Angels, 21 Jump Street, Ghostbusters, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Men in Black.Mak Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade AgainTh time for SNE to sell thi asset could absolut be now as it ha a decent pipeline, can capit on the Spider-Man results, and may full well know the best is behind it. The compani lost the right to the Jame Bond movi and ha onli releas two of it top 10 gross movi sinc 2010 (SkyfallandTh Amaz Spider-Man).Soni Entertain ha more to offer a new owner than just movies. The divis also produc and distribut televis shows, and ha a hand of media networks, with a strong presenc internationally. The division' global footprint cover 178 countri and more than 1.4 billion subscribers.Hit televis show under the Soni umbrella includeBetterCal Saul,Jeopardy,BlackishandShark Tank. The televis divis ha realli grown, and could be the biggest reason thi asset is undervalued, and set up a big win for Soni stock. In the 2015-16 season, Soni had 33 seri on the air. That is a sharp increas from the 15 a decad ago in 2005-06.Bottom Line for Soni StockAdd it all up and you have a top five movi studio, an increas produc of origin content for numer channels, owner of strong intellectu properti and syndic programs, and an intern televis channel owner. Those asset will make Sony' Entertain arm incred valuabl to CBS, a Chines media compani or whoever is current snif around.Soni may be hesit to let go of the entertain arm that ha help to make up for weak in the electron market in year past. Thursday' Q3, however, show just how much troubl the movi busi is in.Th compani should capit on it upcom slate and reward Soni stock holder sharehold with a sale of the division.A of thi writing, Chri Katj did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsTh 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryTh postWhi Soni Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertain Bizappear first onInvestorPlace."

There are differ circumst thi time around, of course, but the dynam that ha made neg reaction to earn in the past opportun is still in place, so the end result is like to be the same.Th biggest problem with the Q4 result as far as trader were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click wa down, and oper cost had risen to the point where earn per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’ estim of around $9.64. Still, revenu of $26.06 billion beat the estim $25.26 billion.Ther wa also a concern lurk in the background regard Googl take on both Amazon (AMZN)’ Echo and Appl (AAPL)’ iPhon with recent hardwar launches. Googl said that they were pleas with the reaction to both Googl Home and the Pixel phone without go into specifics, but doubt about the wisdom of the strategi persist.I actual believ that Googl ha a chanc of limit success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphil struggl as the iPhone’ domin of the mobil phone market is well established. Most estim of sale of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardli put a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profit as a nich product.Hom ha an easier, more logic path to success as Googl is the natur choic of those look for what is, essentially, a free-stand search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is go to be the driver of the recoveri in the stock price that histori suggest will come soon.First, the increas in oper cost that Googl report seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of invest in the core business. Loss in what the compani call “Other Bets,” thing like “Nest” and self drive cars, were actual reduc somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there wa signific progress on the autonom vehicl front.Th possibl of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are gener seen as the leader in driverless car research and technology.Th other issue, of fall cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seem on the surface. It reflect a continu move to mobil that result in that metric falling, but the volum of click increasing. The same issu was, in part, respons for the April and Octob drop in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tell the stori of how long it wa until investor realiz that volum more than offset fall CPC.Look at Google’ result and the market reaction to them, I get a sens of déjà vu. We have actual been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investor a chanc to buy cheaply. It seem that in thi case the market is still learn from it mistak and over time the outcom here is most like to be the same."

R&D, sale and marketing, and G&A expens all have seen huge increas in 2016 as Fitbit struggl to remain on top of a wearabl market that' slow faster than anyon expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recent discuss Fitbit stock in relat to aslow wearabl market; he wa pretti blunt in hi assess of the job CEO Jame Park is do guid the compani through a rough patch that' seen FIT stock declin by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarket and IDC both cite smartwatch as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consum just can't see the need for them as they overlap on featur alreadi found in smartphones. And when ad their heftier price tags, smartwatch are a fade fad.""So, what doe Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% project at the start of the year? It buy not one, but two compani that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continu to wast money on bad acquisit and wast overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit' comfi cash posit - $672 million in cash and market secur as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and market securities, no debt, and an oper margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stock to Buy for Better Deal Than the Great RecessionA for short FIT stock, I'm of two mind on this.Yes, theshort repres almost 36% of it floatand it margin are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it' got to be attract to somebodi in the industri - mayb even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from drop much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investor buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposit look like it will be a winner ani time soon.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsHere' How Appl Inc.

"Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E",2/2/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn of the biggest neg surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company' sky-high price-to-earn ratio. Accord to Googl Finance, AMZN stock current trade at an eye-pop 191 time it trail earn of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon ha at least given investor the courtesi of grow profit to tri to somewhat justifi the lofti valuation. That 191x is on trail 12-month earn of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earn $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translat into 52 cent per share.It' obviou Amazon stock investor care about growth, not valuation. AMZN' sky-high P/E ha been in place for years, and will like continu for some time.And that' actual OK. Here are two import reason why:Amazon Revenu GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stori in today' market.When the compani releas 2016' final number Thursday, Feb. 2, analyst expect Amazon to post revenu of $137 billion. That' an improv of more than 25% versu 2015' top line - a difficult feat when you'r talk about 12-digit sales. And Amazon' $107 billion in revenu last year wa 20% better than 2014.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryW live in a world in whichS&P 500constitu are do well if they'r post just single-digit increas on the top line. You can blame thi at least partli on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weigh down American multinationals. But the fact remain that meaning growth is a scarc qualiti in today' stock market - especi among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easi way for investor to get access to big growth with rel littl risk.And Amazon is hardli run out of fuel. The compani ha onli begun to expand into groceri and apparel - two huge categories. Trillion of dollar are spent worldwid each year at physic stores. That' not to mention the other gain Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Servic cloud offer and other newer initiatives.Analyst predict Amazon' revenu will increas anoth 22% in 2017, hit $168 billion. So again - the growth stori is still well intact.But it' not all about growth. Mani AMZN stock bull argu that we'r just look at earn the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?On thing that separ Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo from mani other execut is hi abil to look at the really,reallylong-term. He' also will to spend billion of dollar on ideas, and is OK with hit a few dud if it mean spawn great new ideas.Rememb the company' smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a websit call Askville? I'm guess you might rememb the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on it smartphon alone.Thi kind of risk take is an inher part of Amazon' culture. It' the line of think that prod the compani to introduc some of it biggest winner to date, like cloud services, Prime ship and the Kindle.Thus, mani investor look at AMZN stock in a differ way. They look at the company' oper profit, then they add back it substanti research and develop cost to get a ""truer"" sens of profitability.Admittedly, that chang the pictur dramatically.Appl Inc. Bulls: Bewar These Charts! (AAPL)In it most recent quarter, Amazon produc net incom of $252 million, which across 485 million dilut share becam dilut earn of 52 cent per share. At the time, AMZN wa trade at $822 per share. If we annual that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterli earn fluctuat - thi is just for an example), we'r look at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also report oper profit of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a signific expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annual that, then divid the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let' take the actual numbers. Amazon current trade for 190 time trail 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and post oper profit of more than $4 billion. That come to $40.19 per share combined, and put AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That' a lot of creativ accounting, so take that with a spoon of salt. But it' an interest argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continu to be one of the best growth stori in today' market. As long as that continues, investor aren't go to care about the headlin P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock ha doubl sever time over despit it.Amazon is solidli profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as larg as investor typic would like. But those earn are be reinvest back in the busi - which is what a high-growth compani like Amazon should be do anyway.A of thi writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhi Amazon.com, Inc.

We see that despit the big swing lower from the 2015 high into the mid-2016 lows, and most recent back up toward the 2015 highs, Appl has, larg speaking, not realli accomplish much sinc earli 2015.Click to EnlargeBulls, however, note that the May 2016 low coincid with critic technic support made up of horizont support (lower purple-dot line) as well as the 200-week simpl move averag (red). Equal important, on the other hand, is that after Wednesday' post-earn rally, AAPL is now within a few point of these aforement previou all-tim high from 2015. Through a technic lens, thi could offer up as much resist as the 2015 low offer support.In other words, befor Appl stock can sustain break to new all-tim highs, a consolid phase most like is in order.Look at the daili chart, we see that sinc mid-Novemb 2016, AAPL stock ha now ralli approxim 25%, which is not a small move for the stock to accomplish in a matter of two-and-a-half months.Click to EnlargeA simpl yet accur observ through the len of technic analysi is that old all-tim high are not easili overcom on the first try, particularli if the stock ha not consolid below or near those previou all-tim high for some time.Apple' current chart thu is in dire need of some consolid befor it can make a better attempt at fresh all-tim high on a more sustain basis.How to Trade Appl Stock HereI see two specif trade set up:If AAPL stock break and hold below Wednesday' intraday low around $127, then the stock could be play from the short side for a mean-revers move back into the mid- to low $120s. Alternatively, option trader could also look to sell out-of-the-money call spread on the stock at that time.Quick trader could look to buy AAPL stock for fast profit should the stock push and hold abov Wednesday' intraday high around $130.50 for a move toward the 2015 high around $133.Either way, upsid in AAPL stock through a multiweek/multimonth len is like limited. Trade should be construct accordingly.Lik what you see? Sign up for our dailyBeat the Belle-lett and get Serge' invest advic deliv to your inbox everi morning!

Is Apple (AAPL) A Double From Here?,2/1/2017,"I talk yesterday about the Fed. As I said, I think we'll find that the Fed will shift gear again to stay behind the curv on inflation, to let the economi run a littl hot. They met today and it wa a non-event. They said noth to build momentum on their rate hike from December.Th news of the day ha been Appl (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings. Peopl over the past coupl of year have been call for the declin in Apple. They'v said it' topped. They can't innov in the post-Stev Job era. The iPhon wa magic. But reproduc magic isn’t easy. Onc you put a comput in everyone' pocket, there' not much more they can do to it with it. These are all of the quip about Apple' peak. They may be right. But Apple' peak, at least as a stock, is greatli exaggerated.They report a huge posit surpris on earn yesterday after the close. The stock wa up 6% on the day. But even befor that, I suspect it ha becom a much love stock in the past two month in the ""smart money"" investor community.W should see in the come weeks, as big investor disclos their posit for the end of Q4, Appl will have return to a lot of portfolio again. Warren Buffett, an investor that ha made hi fortun buy when other are selling, built a big stake at the low of the year last year. And it' a perfect Buffett stock.It’ incred cheap compar to the market.Th stock still trade at 15x earnings. Much cheaper than the market. Appl trade at 13x next year’ project earnings. The S&P 500 trade at 16.5x. What about Apple' monster cash position? Appl ha even more cash now -- a record $246 billion. If we exclud the cash from the valuation, Appl market cap goe down from $675 billion to $429 billion. That would equat to Appl trade at closer to 9x earnings. Though not an “appl to apples” that valuat would group Appl with the like of these S&P 500 compon that trade around 9 time earnings, like: Dow Chemical, Prudenti Financial, Bed Bath & Beyond, a Norwegian chemic compani (LBY), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It' safe to say no one is debat whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacl of it business. Yet, if we strip out the cash in Apple, AAPL share are trade closer to an HPE valuation.Add to that, Appl now ha afresh catalystcom in, Trump policies. The new Presid Trump is incentiv Appl (and others) tobr offshor cash hoard back homewith a flat 10% tax. And Appl make money – a lot of it. Acut in the corpor tax ratewil be a boon for earnings. Two year ago, Carl Icahn argu that Appl should use (a lot more of) their cash to buyback share – and, with that, valu the stock at doubl it current levels.makeArticleAd();For help build a high potenti portfolio for 2017, follow me in ourBillionaire’ Portfolio, where you look over my shoulder as I follow the world’ best investor into their best stocks.

Even better, the compani said it expect more growth in it second quarter.But beyond Apple' financi performance, investor like had other question on their mind -- question more suitabl for management' earn call follow the release.

Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here' how Appl CEO Tim Cook and hi manag team answer these three question on Tuesday:1. How confid is manag in it product pipeline?Whil the iPhon did return to growth in Apple' first quarter, it wa still rel slow growth. The iPhone' headwind have put the pressur on the compani to develop new product to help acceler growth. While investor obvious shouldn't have expect Appl to spill the bean on anyth specif on Tuesday, Tim Cook did express confid in the company' pipelin of upcom products.In Apple' first-quart earn press release, Cook said Appl is ""veri excited"" about the product in it pipeline. And dure Apple' earn call, Cook show even more enthusiasm, saying, ""we'v got some excit thing in the pipeline; I feel really, realli good about it.""2.

Servic revenu climb 18% year over year, grow to about 9% of total sales, up from about 8% last year.

Imag source: Apple.Go forward, Cook said (here' aReut transcriptof the earn call) that he expect servic to becom even more integr to Apple' business:Servic are becom a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenu to be the size of a Fortun 100 compani thi year. Our servic offer are now drive over 150 million paid custom subscriptions. Thi includ our own services, and third-parti content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about thi momentum, and our goal is to doubl the size of our servic busi in the next four years.Thes expect for Apple' servic segment translat to a forecast of about 20% annual growth over the next four years.3. If there' a tax break for repatriation, doe Appl plan to take advantag of it?With Presid Donald Trump say he plan to offer a one-off tax holiday for U.S. compani to repatri their oversea fund at a lower tax rate, investor have good reason to be interest in what Apple' CEO think of this.

So I think that' veri good for the countri and good for Apple.But Cook said investor will have to wait to see how repatri fund would be allocated:What we would do with it -- let' wait and see exactli what it is -- but as I'v said before, we are alway look at acquisitions. We acquir 15 to 20 compani per year for the last four years, and we look for compani of all sizes, and there' not a size that we would not do base on just the size of it. It' more about the strateg valu of it.Beyond acquisitions, Appl could obvious alloc fund toward other capit invest in it own business, a dividend increase, a special dividend, share repurchases, or even all of the above.Whil these were some of the more import topic cover dure the call, manag also cover more detail on the company' servic business, it region results, the smartphon market, and more.

However, thi time around, in addit to the usual point of differentiation, Appl includ a dual-len camera on the iPhon 7 Plu which enabl an interest optic zoom feature.Th key lesson here is that if Appl bring interest innov and featur to premium product and tri to charg a premium for those features, then it may veri well get paid for those features.Open sesameAt thi point, it' obviou what Appl should do next -- introduc even higher-pr iPhon with even more interest featur and point of differentiation.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think,2/1/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) open for trade Feb. 1 at an all-tim high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of it domin in mobil apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challeng the video leagu leader with a mobil app for exist stream box like theAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will thi do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMov into TV through an app rather than a devic make sense, given the failur of the origin Facebook phone and it overwhelm success with app for others' phones.FB is alreadi bankrol the creation of video for the video tab of itsmobil app.So where doe Facebook fit it servic into the evolv market, and what doe it presenc as a broadcast mean to it claim not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneTh compani is alreadi a presenc in video thank toFacebook Live, which allow live stream of video on the servic and it ha aPresidenti endorsement.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatFB ha prepar to offer longer video by introduc ""mid-roll"" ad - ad that play in the middl of a video - to it line-up, make the servic more TV-like.Ov time, thi might allow Facebook to compet directli withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTub in the grow market for stream services.Th problem is that there is a big differ between the experi you get on a mobil phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support video of a few minutes, while peopl will watch TV for hours-and-hours.Ther is an assumpt in the breathless report of Facebook' latest move that TV is easy; that it' just someth you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in gener subscrib and Emmys, and Amazon in gener Prime member and Oscar buzz, that is an easi mistak to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, thi may not be as huge a deal as analyst think.Netflix revenu is onli a fraction of FB stock's. Analyst expect Facebook to deliv over $27 billion in 2016 revenu when it report after the market close Feb. 1. Thi is against roughli $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also bring just 3% of that revenu to the bottom line, while FB stock bring nearli one-third of revenu to it net incom line.Ent the world of creat televis pose anoth risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ha repeatedli saidh doesn't run a media company, that hi is just a commun service. Media compani have respons to truth and accuraci that, say, phone compani don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is go to licens content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becom a media company, subject to polit and public scrutini for it program choices, on a global basis. Thi is a danc FB stock sharehold should fear, becaus it cost money to play, and carri risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choic in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it' where everyon is heading. FB stock doe not want to be left behind.Th Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhil most analyst are jump for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. Thi move ha enorm implic for the entir company, for how it' perceiv and (more important) what it cost to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefer to manag itself through algorithms. Algorithm scale in way peopl do not. Facebook is start to bow to pressur on the media front,hir Campbel Brownto coordin media alliances. Now it' about to becom a TV network, or at least a stream service.What will that mean to it profit and growth? I think they both slow, becaus peopl aren't algorithm and talent ha temper that code doe not have. Polit can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL),2/1/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announc HomeKit - it strategi for becom the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) reveal it Alexa-pow Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhil there are current sever dozen HomeKit compat smart home products, Amazon' Alexa is now connect to thousand of smart product and servic and ha spread from the Echo to third-parti devices.On the surface, it look as though Amazon ha outmaneuv and thoroughli trounc Apple. But despit the seemingli insurmount lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beat AMZN in thi smart home race.Here' how.Appl Chose the Close Approach With HomeKitAppl tend to be extrem cautious. It softwar is design to be user-friendli and secure. iPhon app can't just be download from anywhere; they need to go through the offici App Store and that requir approv by AAPL. Third-parti hardwar need to be certifi by Appl befor it can be market as be iOS-compatible.It' that ""walled"" approach that hasmad the iPhon more securethan smartphon runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android oper system.With the iPhon and Siri - Apple' voic assist - at the center of Apple' smart home strategy, that focu on security, compat and eas of use carri over toHomeKit. Manufactur who want to make their smart devic HomeKit-compat face a daunt seri of requirements.Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Ha a New Hero: Services!A point out in a recent Reuter articl ondiff smart home approaches, thi includ be forc to buy a special HomeKit chip, be limit to approv (and more expens than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip and even extend to manufactur be limit to factori that are certifi by Apple. End-to-end encrypt is mandatory. Onc a HomeKit product is ready, it face extens test by Appl engin to ensur compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alon can take three to five months.So you have addit costs, the procedur red tape and a delay. It' easi to understand whyAppl current list onli 75 or so HomeKit-compat devices. And half of those are either differ color option or region variat of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radic differ approach with it Echo speaker and Alexa. The compani openli court third-parti compani to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-en interact with an Amazon Alexa-pow device.A skill can be the abil to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be tell Alexa to turn on your home' smart light or to start your electr car. The process is simple. Amazon provid an exampl showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includ the time need to creat a develop account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it' published.That' how Amazon Alexa tripl it avail skill in just three month last year, hit 3,000 in September. If that sound impressive, by CE 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addit to skills, Amazon also encourag third parti to integr Alexa function into their products. That way, consum get the Alexa experi without requir an Echo speaker.That' a far easier process than Appl HomeKit certification. A ""Work with Alexa"" label take about 10 day to obtain (it can even be issu by third parti labs) and doesn't requir special chips. Accord to the Reuter post, that ha result in over 250 product that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, includ third-parti speaker with Alexa and even home applianc with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Appl Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityTh differ approach of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidli leap to a massiv lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where thi could chang rapidly.Secur is increasingli becom an issu for smart, connect devices. Apple' HomeKit approach emphas security, to the point of forc the use of special chip and even certifi manufactur facilities.Amazon' Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leav it platform rel exposed. Amazon told Reuter it can't guarante the secur of third-parti devic run Alexa. Those thousand of Alexa skill also integr with third-parti servic that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trad of the Day: Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAl it would take is one catastroph hack for a PR disast that turn consum off Alexa. As CNET put it in a review of thehack risk for differ smart home standards: ""Don't assum that a devic ha high secur standard just becaus it work with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere' no disput the fact that Amazon complet caught Appl and other off guard with it stealthi approach of sneak Alexa into the home use it Echo connect speaker.Befor the Echo, it wa gener assum that a smartphon would be the natur smart home controller. Make Alexa integr so open ha also paid off for AMZN, result in a formid lead in the smart home in a veri short time. That lead may well turn into complet domin of the connect home. But Amazon' open approach may also prove to be it Achil heel.Should hacker turn their attent to Amazon Alexa, the result headlin may flip the equat and put the much more secur Appl HomeKit on top in the long run.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

Shed it legaci imag as a boxy-cell-phon manufacturer, NOK stock ha been extrem acquisitive.We'r not just talk about the buyout ofAlcatel-Lucent, although that is a big part of the story. It' also the procur of lesser known asset that will assert Nokia' new role as apubl networksprovider.At the same time, we'r talk about NOK stock here.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future,2/1/2017,"When you regularli give your opinion on someth as unpredict as financi markets, gloat when you get someth right is rare a good idea. That is especi true when those opinion arearchivedfor all to see; it' too easi for a reader to check out that archiv and find exampl of when the market and hindsight combin to make even logic argument seem foolish. I am fulli awar of that, but when it come to yesterday’searn releas from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What realli matter about the Appl releas to investor is certainli not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant return to growth in revenu for the first time in a year, nor that the alreadi great margin at Appl increased. Those last two are important, but necessarili backward looking, as all hard data in an earn releas are by definition.What matter most is what the report tell us about the futur and there the messag wa somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();Th offici guidanc for Q1 2017 contain in the releas fell just short of Wall Street’ expectations, which would normal be enough of a neg to more than offset the good histor results. In thi case, though, a look at where Appl succeed in Q4 2016 suggest that that guidanc may just be anoth exampl of Apple’ past tendenc to err on the side of under-promis and over-deliv when it come to guidance. That is why, even though growth stall last year, AAPL ha beaten EP expect in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhon sale hit anoth record. That is particularli signific as not that long ago mani were predict that Googl parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’ move into the phone busi would do Appl some seriou harm. It look now as if those say that were about as accur as those that maintain that the Window phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.Th fact is that the iPhon ha an icon statu that look almost imposs to challenge. Even phone that are object better in some ways, such as memori capacity, camera resolution, or speaker qualiti for example, cannot take market share. As Appl advanc the iPhon with each release, beat them on those and other front becom harder, but remains, accord to the evid so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynam remains, hold Appl stock and ad to hold at time of weak still make sens for investors.Th weak in thi releas wa mainli in one area; iPad sale declin for the twelfth success quarter. That, however, wa offset to some extent by strong sale of Mac and Appl Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Appl doesn’t releas a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I point out in the articl referenc above, anybodi who tri to buy a Seri Two watch as a Christma gift is probabl awar that sale were at least more than Appl expected. None were avail in ani of the five state where I tri and most store have just now receiv inventory.That shortag of watches, combin with Cook’ admiss that they serious underestim demand for the iPhon 7 Plus, mean that the record sale report yesterday were achiev with a background of suppli constraints. Given that and the fact that there wa consider growth in area such as servic and enterpris oper that still have lot of room for Appl to expand, the messag underli yesterday’ earn is that, despit convent wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

"Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why the ""Most Accurate"" Apple Analyst Blew It",2/1/2017,"On Tuesday afternoon,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) post strong earn result for the first quarter of it 2017 fiscal year. Revenu beat analysts' forecast and the company' own guidanc range. Earn per share comfort beat the averag analyst estim as well. Finally, iPhon sale rose 5% year over year, to 78.3 million units; most analyst had been expect a smaller increas -- or even a decline.Appl post strong iPhon sale for the critic holiday quarter. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();On of those analyst wrongli expect an iPhon sale declin wa Ming-Chi Kuo of Taiwan' KGI Securities. In the past few years, Kuo ha gain a reput among mani investor for be the ""most accur Appl analyst."" The fact that he whif so badli on hi iPhon sale forecast is an import remind to investor not to reli too much on analysts' forecasts.Understand the ""most accurate"" Appl analystMing-Chi Kuo ha veri good sourc -- either in Apple' suppli chain or at the compani itself -- give him advanc warn of new product featur and product plans. He isn't perfect, but he' one of the best sourc out there for news about Apple' futur products.Ming-Chi Kuo correctli predict mani featur of the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plus. Imag source: Apple.For example, Kuocorrectli predictedmost of the key featur of the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu prior to those model be offici unveil last September. That includ obscur detail like the fact that there wouldn't be 32GB version of the new jet black iPhones.Kuo also ha a pretti good track record for short-term shipment forecasts. A few day befor Apple' Q1 earn report two year ago, he predict that Appl had sold 73 million iPhon dure the holiday quarter, when most analyst still expect a shipment number well below 70 million. In fact, Appl report that it had ship 74.5 million iPhones.However, Kuo' competit advantag appear to be limit to pick up suppli chain rumors. When it come to estim demand for Apple' products, hi record is far less pristine.Underestim iPhon sale by a mileFor the past sever months, Ming-Chi Kuo had stuck to a forecast that Appl would ship 70 million-75 million iPhon in the first quarter. At the midpoint of that range, iPhon sale would have been down 3% year over year, wherea iPhon sale actuallyincreased5%.Thi doesn't fulli captur how far off Kuo' expect were, though. Prior to late September, he had expect Appl to ship just 65 million iPhon in Q1, down 13% year over year.Th further you zoom out, the wors Kuo' predict have been. Back in April, he state that in a best-cas scenario, Appl would ship 205 million iPhon for the full 2016 calendar year. (Hi worst-cas scenario wa 190 million shipments.) Appl actual ship 215.4 million iPhon for the full year.Don't trust analyst too muchInvestor who soldAppl stocklast year -- or decid not to buy it -- base on Kuo' rel bearish project have miss out on a big rally. Sinc bottom out around $90 last May, Appl stock ha come roar back, reach $125 in after-hour trade on Tuesday afternoon. Thi show the danger of reli too much on analysts' forecasts.Appl Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Follow top analyst for a stock you own is a good way to stay up to date on the latest trend and the gener outlook for the next few quarters. However, while Wall Street analyst may in theori be the ""experts,"" even the best one can make some big mistakes. For individu investors, it' import to understand when to trust an analyst' predictions.For Apple, Ming-Chi Kuo is an import analyst to follow for learn about potenti new product and earli product plans, becaus of hi suppli chain connections. However, Apple' sale result ultim depend on demand.B plug in to the suppli chain doesn't help much in forecast demand. Perhap Kuo can accur estim how mani compon Apple' supplier are building. That show how mani devic Appl plan to build -- and, by extension, how much demand Appl expect to see. But build plan are fluid and routin chang base on actual demand.Thus, while Kuo is great at call the play-by-play of what Appl is do now, hi analysi is less reliabl look further into the future.

Maybe. Mayb not.AMGN stock holder should pay attent to see if Enbrel will resum growth through increas volume, as oppos to price hike.Enbrel face three major growth barriers.First, it compet againstAbbVi Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson' Remicade. Thi lead to the second challenge.Stiff competit necessit increment rebat to payer to maintain it formulari position.Th third challeng is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA ha approv Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovarti AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lacklust Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen' Drug PricingInvestor also should look close at how fast Amgen is hike prices.I rais concern about Amgen stockgrow sale by increas drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the compani report it Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two year on, the trend of grow sale with price hike is still commonplac at AMGN.From a busi perspective, it' smart to tri to squeez out everi possibl dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. govern is stand up against it. Presid Donald Trump told drugmak in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the price down.""Thi won't be good for the top and bottom line of ani drugmaker. However, for a compani who thrive on hike drug price like AMGN, the downsid get bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is herald as potenti one of Amgen' best sellers. The compani said the drug cater to ""seriou diseas with signific unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payer have employ utilization-manag procedures, which limit patients' abil to gain access to Repatha. Exec said dure Q3 earn call that they'r work with payer and provid to allow unlabel patient access. Investor should look to see if collabor with payer and provid are yield signific Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowTh drug, which current compet withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceut Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescript (NBRx) in Q4, accord to an Amgen present at thi year' JPMorgan Healthcar Conference. Still, AMGN stock holder probabl want to know just how much in sale that amount to.But it ha to be note that an ongo court case that Amgen file against Sanofi and Regeneron onpat infringementground is tip the scale in Rapatha' favor for now.Finally, investor should pay attent to see if low expens is continu and will continu at Amgen. Sinc the begin of 2015, AMGN ha reduc it total expens by roughli 3.7% to 13.22%. Keep expens low will be critic to futur profitability, especi in Trump' recent focu on drugmakers.Earn apart, I believ the uncertainti surround the futur make AMGN stock less attractive.A of thi writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

"Apple, Inc. Can Still Set Records",2/1/2017,"Imag source: Apple.It' been a while sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) post a bona fide blowout quarter, but I think it' safe to say that last quarter qualifies.makeArticleAd();Th Mac maker set an all-tim record high with quarterli revenue, which came in at $78.4 billion. That' a few billion higher than the $75.9 billion in sale that Appl gener a year ago, and abov the high end of Apple' own guidanc ($78 billion). Naturally, that wa driven by strong iPhon sales, anoth record at 78.3 million. Thi all come as the iPhon 7 wa arguabl the most increment model updat in years, keep the same overal industri design with no clear must-hav feature. Combin with the perenni suppli constraints, it' rather impress that the compani wa abl to move that mani smartphones.Oth quarterli record set in Q4 were earn per share ($3.36), servic revenu ($7.2 billion), Mac revenu ($7.2 billion), Appl Watch unit (who knows?!), and Appl Watch revenu (your guess is as good as mine). Four out of Apple' five geograph oper segment also set fresh high (all but Greater China). That' what I call comprehens performance.Two camera are better than oneA usual, the iPhon wa the star of the show, compris nearli 70% of sales. While sale were up 5%, sell-through wa up 8% thank to robust demand. In line with CFO Luca Maestri'spredict in October, averag sell price (ASPs) bounc back sequenti with a vengeance. ASP were depress for a few quarter in 2016 follow the launch of the $400 iPhon SE, but have now rebound to $695 -- pretti compar to last year' $691.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarter shown.Thi tell investor a few things, some obviou and other less so. Clearly, the iPhon 7 Plu is a hit, like due to the dual-camera system that is the most notabl differenti feature. On the earn call, CEO Tim Cook note that the mix wa skew toward the Plu model more than in ani prior cycl (thi is the third year that Appl ha had Plu model with 5.5-inch displays). Cook even acknowledg later in the call that Appl did not predict iPhon 7 Plu demand veri well, which advers affect product plans.Additionally, Appl final increas the entry-level storag to 32 GB in 2016, at long last address an increasingli promin custom complaint. The financi risk to that move wa remov the upsel incentive, and the $100 to $200 that goe with it. If 32 GB of storag is sufficient, a larger proport of custom may opt for the base model instead of upgrading; 16 GB ha long been woefulli insufficient, virtual assur strong upgrad activity. The good news is that Appl ha maintain a rel compar mix of upgrades, as evidenc by the strong ASP.Mac and iPadsTh fact that Mac revenu hit a new all-tim high show that Appl still ha trick up it sleeve. We'r talk about a busi that' over 40 year old, after all. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar were significantli constrain dure the quarter, but the relat price increas appear to have been abl to help Mac ASP by quit a bit. Mac ASP jump sequenti from $1,175 to $1,348; thi is the first time in nearli three year that thi figur wa abov $1,300.There wasn't a whole lot of news on the iPad front, in part becaus Appl didn't updat it tablet lineup in the fall. Appl sold 13.1 million units, down 19% from a year ago. iPad revenu fell more than that due to declin ASP ($423). The more afford iPad continu to prove rather popular. Cook said the compani ha some excit thing in the pipelin for iPad, potenti refer to the rumor around other display size or the Appl Pencil 2.Servic to $50 billionApple' servic busi ha just offici becom a $25 billion busi on a trailing-12-month basis. Manag ambiti hope todoublethi busi within the next four years, target $50 billion in annual revenu in 2020. That' an aggress goal, but also in line with the company' effort to shift investor attent toward recur revenu sources.CFO Luca Maestri note that the App Store continu to be the main driver of growth, thank to increas buy activ within the instal base as well as new user come to the platform. The music business, includ both download and streaming, ha start grow again over the past three quarters. iCloud storag upsel are also grow ""veri quickly,"" as is AppleCare. Simpli put, the plethora of servic that Appl offer are all fare well.Wrap upShar repurchas came in at $11 billion, which includ $5 billion in open market purchas and a $6 billion acceler share repurchas (ASR) program. That' the ninth ASR for those keep score at home. The compani retir 65.3 million share dure the quarter thank to these aggress repurchases, which contribut to the record EP due to it accret effects.That put cumul share repurchas at $143.7 billion out of the current $175 billion authorization. Appl updat it capit return program everi spring, typic alongsid it April earn release. There' plenti of room to accommod Apple' typic level of repurchases, and investor can look forward to an updat next quarter.In term of fundamentals, the result were a blowout. Investor reaction, on the other hand, is anoth topic. Share jump over 4% in extend trading, and Appl hasn't trade around $125 sinc mid-2015. I still have doubt about Appl enjoy ani semblanc of multipl expansion, but the busi is as strong as ever.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In one sense, a huge instal user base - which AAPL has, withmor than 1 billion iO devic in activ use- work against the company. When the iPhon first began to take off, AAPL wa sell to peopl who'd never own one before. Now, that pool of easi sale is dwindling. And Appl is left in the tougher posit of convinc it instal user base to upgrade.Thu the hand-wring about slow iPhon sales.Apple' Servic divis larg benefit from that huge instal user base, though. True, AAPL onli get one shot at sell these custom AppleCare. But onc they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Appl Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explor Apple' other services.

But it add up, especi when over a billion custom are gener it.Mor importantly, that revenu doesn't drop off the same way hardwar revenu doe when peopl stop buy new iPhones.Som servic - like iCloud and Appl Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keep automat bill the customer' card everi month regardless of whether their iPhon is brand new or five year old. Appl Pay revenu are increas as more countri and busi accept it and iPhon owner grow more accustom to use it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeopl never stop buy apps.

3 ETFs For True Total Market Coverage,1/31/2017,"ETF investor often spend an inordin amount of time tri to find the best spot in the market. They love focus on specif sectors, factors, or tactic strategi that are show a promis edge. However, there is often a fundament need for simpl and diversifi stock exposur at the lowest possibl cost.Thi type of core foundat is the essenc behind total stock market funds. They allow you to stay correl with the broadest possibl index and charg expens that are so fraction as to be almost non-existent. They embodi the true spirit of the ETF philosophi in their liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency.Th largest and most well-known of thi group is theVanguard Total Stock Market ETF(VTI). Over the years, I’v lost track of how mani award and commend thi fund ha received. It true valu proposit is the simplic of a singl vehicl for complet U.S. stock market coverag with the lowest possibl track error.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');VTI own a basket of 3,592 publicli trade secur across the large, mid, and small-cap verticals. You can’t get much more diversifi than that. The fund is market-cap weight to give the largest stock a greater share of it $70 billion asset base. Nevertheless, the top holding,Appl Inc(AAPL) onli account for 2.5% of the total portfolio. That leav a larg swath of exposur to be distribut through the thousand of remain holdings.On of the highli tout advantag of VTI is it ultra-low expens ratio of 0.05%. That’ just $50 for everi $100,000 invest on an annual basis. The minim expens ensur thi fund is appropri as a long-term posit in virtual ani type of equiti portfolio.Th next largest fund by size is theSchwab US Broad Market ETF(SCHB), which ha $7.7 billion under management. Thi ETF track a basket of 2,000 stock domicil in the U.S. through all market-cap segments.SCHB claim one of the lowest industri expens ratio at just 0.03% annually. Thi fee ha been increment lower multipl time over the years, which add to it attract for long-term investors. It’ even conceiv that one day thi ETF will charg as low as one basi point per year for access to it diversifi stock portfolio.Last, but certainli not least, is theiShar Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF(ITOT). Thi fund share trait of both VTI and SCHB in it overal makeup. It charg an expens ratio of 0.03% and contain more than 3,600 underli holdings. ITOT ha $6.7 billion in asset under manag and ha been in place sinc 2004.While all three of these fund have minor differ in their structure, they must ultim be judg on their results. The 5-year price chart below show that the return for all three are almost indistinguish from each other.That level of correl is a depend statist for those that are agon over which is the best fund to pick. There realli is no wrong answer here. Although, the decis may be made easier if one of these option is avail transaction-fre from your brokerag platform. That would truli minim total cost and allow you to scale in or out of ani share with the lowest possibl friction.Th Bottom LineTot market ETF are solid tool for both experienc investor and those who are just start out on thi journey. They provid a truli simpl path to a diversifi stock alloc without have to agon over variou invest styles. Remov complex from the equat can result in better execut and a much greater chanc for long-term success.Disclosure: At the time thi articl wa written, the author own share of ITOT."

Intel Corporation Gets an Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Boost,1/31/2017,"Finally, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) ha manag to achiev a real degre of success in the market for chip that go into smartphones. A while back, it wa reveal thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had chosen to use Intel as a second sourc for the LTE modem that power it iPhone.Apple' iPhon SE. Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Now, while some investor may have worri that Intel might be ""give away"" these cellular modem -- in a move similar to what the compani did with it Bay Trail tablet processor (i.e. provid platform cost offset valu more than the sell price of the chips) -- the company' most recent financi result show that thi is veri clearli not the case.Th big modem boostIntel' modem sale fall under it Client Comput Group (CCG), which deriv the bulk of it revenu from sale of processor and other compon that go into person computers. When Intel report financi result for CCG, it give investor two number to chew on: platform revenu and ""other"" revenue. Platform revenu is made up of processor and accompani chipset (also known as a PCH) sales, while ""other"" revenu refer to a smorgasbord of other complementari technologies, includ cellular modems.W can see that Intel is see a veri larg boost in cellular modem sale becaus Intel' revenu from ""other"" went from $356 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 -- when Intel sold precis zero modem to Appl -- to $773 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 -- when Intel is known to be sell modem to Apple.Of course, it' like that not all of that increas is due to the ramp up in cellular modem shipment -- Intel did take the time to highlight that it enjoy record Wi-Fi chip shipment last quarter -- but there' realli noth els that can explain the substanti major of that increase.What doe thi revenu increas tell us?Th bad news is that we can't deduc too much about the profit of these modem sole from these result -- though Intel did indic later in the call that cellular modem shipment dure 2017 would serv as a headwind to the company' gross profit margins. So we know that the modem are sold at lower than corpor averag margins.What we can deduc is this, however: Intel isn't provid excess ""contra-revenue"" payment to get these modem into the iPhon becaus Intel is gener posit revenu -- and signific revenu at that -- from it modems. (Although we alreadi knew thi becaus Intel would almost have certainli disclos to investor in advanc that a ramp of it modem shipment would detract from oper profit.) If that were the case, some investor may have want to see the financi evid befor believ it.Look aheadIf we assum that Intel is go to continu to suppli Appl with modem beyond the iPhon 7 -- and the odd of thi look good -- then there are some interest financi implications. First, Intel' share at Appl may be set to grow in the come product cycle. Right now, Intel is in some portion of the iPhon 7 models, but is complet absent from the iPhon SE, iPhon 6s, or iPhon 6s.Onc Appl releas new model and waterfal the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu to serv as it mid-rang offer -- and if we assum that Intel and Qualcomm get roughli equival order alloc dure the next iPhon cycl to what we'r see with the iPhon 7 seri -- then Intel' share will necessarili go up. I also wouldn't be surpris to see Intel insid of a futur iPhon SE, as well.It' reason to expect that Intel will see some nice year-over-year growth in the ""other"" portion of CCG over the cours of 2017, with acceler happen in the second half of the year, due to the launch of the new iPhon models.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For example, Window 10 Pro for Workstat and Window 10 for Enterpris are spike out. Noth unusu there. But then, refer to Window 10 Cloud began to appear. And that start rais eyebrow - what is Window 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMari Jo Foley put the piec togeth yesterday. Quot unnam sources, she say that the mysteri Window 10 Cloud is a new, simplifi version of Microsoft Window that will run onli Unifi Window Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it' a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Window 10.You might also think of it as anoth crack at Window RT …Window RT? But Why?Everyon rememb the mess that wasWindow RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Window onto a consum tablet run ARM chip -the ill-fat Surfac RT - veri nearli dealt MSFT' tablet aspir a fatal blow.However, despit the failur of Window RT, Microsoft ha never given up on the idea of Window on ARM chips. By do so, it can get Window onto mobil devic that can't use the more power and expens chip fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The compani ha alreadi been show offWindow 10 run in emul on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be work on a ""lite"" version that can deliv much of the Window 10 experi on less expensive, lower power ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk fall flat on it face again with what essenti amount to anoth crack at Window RT? There are two reasons.Th first is that dream of ""Window everywhere."" Have the full Window 10 experi on high-pow ARM chip is great, but onli flagship smartphon and tablet can afford to use those chips. Window 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Window (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobil hardware.Th second is Google' Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptop have been under Microsoft' skin for years. They'v becom extrem popular in the educ sector thank to low cost, eas of use and built-in security. And Chromebook have just kept selling, to the point where last year they pass evenAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBook in sales.Microsoft ha tri fight back by help manufactur put out cheap Window 10 laptops, but that hasn't stem the Chromebook flood. Window 10 make for a sluggish experi on inexpens Intel hardware, it' far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lack the drop-dead easi secur of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Befor EarningsWindow 10 Cloud run on laptop with ARM processor would compet head-to-head with Chromebook run Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Window 10.Microsoft refus to comment on theZDNetpost, but the piec point to Window 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Window RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is go to avoid all refer to Window RT - that' poison - and the Window 10 Cloud name could end up be a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder.

Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Th compani had previous guid to $15.7 billion in revenu for the quarter and gross profit margin of 61%, repres sequenti declin from $15.8 billion and 63.3%, respectively.Intel' actual financi result were much more impressive; the compani report $16.4 billion in revenu for the quarter and a gross profit margin percentag of 61.7%, up from $14.9 billion and down from 64.3% in the prior year, respectively.For the full year, Intel rake in $59.4 billion at 60.9% gross profit margin -- a littl abov the midpoint of it long-term gross margin rang of 55% to 65%, though down 170 basi point year over year.Thi upsid appear to have been driven, iron enough, by the company' Client Comput Group (CCG) business, which deriv the bulk of it revenu from sale of compon into person computers, gener view as a declin market.Let' take a closer look at the company' revenu and profit perform in thi segment.Solid improv in revenu and profitabilityIntel report that total CCG revenu hit $9.13 billion in the most recent quarter, up from $8.76 billion in the same quarter a year-ago -- a respect 4% year-over-year boost.Oper incom vastli outpac revenue, though, with thi figur grow from $2.72 billion in the year-ago quarter to $3.52 billion in the most recent quarter -- up almost 30% year over year. Manag attribut thi to lower oper expenses, a ""richer product mix,"" and improv product margin as 14-nanomet chip manufactur yield improved. The same stori ha been play out all year in CCG.Now, it' worth note that Intel report that the ""platform"" portion of it CCG revenue, which consist of sale of processor and chipsets, were roughli flat, at $8.36 billion in the prior year compar with $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But it ""other"" segment -- which includ complementari products, such as wireless chip -- saw revenu more than doubl to $773 million, from $356 million a year-ago.It is like that thi larg boost in ""other"" revenu within CCG wa due primarili to the ramp-up of the company' XMM 7360 cellular modem in theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu devices.Good full-year resultsFor the full year, Intel report that CCG revenu wa up 2%, while expect go into the year were for a decline, with oper profit up a smidgen more than 30%. Platform revenu wa roughli flat, at $30.75 billion versu $30.68 billion, with ""other"" revenu surg from $1.54 billion in 2015 to $2.16 billion in 2016.The iPhon win clearli contribut to a larg part of the ""other"" segment growth here, but the driver of the increas platform revenu is a littl bit subtler.Indeed, Intel report that shipment of it notebook comput processor declin by 1% year over year and that shipment of it desktop comput processor drop by 6%. Key to keep platform revenu flat wa a 2% increas in notebook platform averag sell prices, as well as a 2% increas in desktop platform averag sell prices.What' happening, then, is that comput maker are sell fewer comput than they were before, as evidenc by the notebook and desktop platform unit shipment drops, but the comput that they do sell, on average, contain more expens processors.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story,1/31/2017,"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotenti undervaluedgrowth play in a frothi market. The social network app maker post eye-pop number last quarter -- 32% annual growth in monthli activ user (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and 30% non-GAAP earn growth.Analyst expect MeetMe' revenu and non-GAAP earn to respect rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trade at just 7 time trail earn and 10 time forward earnings. Let' take a look at the five key reason investor aren't buy MeetMe' growth story, despit it high growth figur and low valuations.MeetMe' mobil app. Imag source: Googl Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubl histori with sexual predatorsMeetM let user find new peopl in their area to chat with, similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there' noth inher sinist about the app, there have been multipl report of MeetM be use by sexual predators.In 2014, the Citi of San Francisco su MeetM for the unlaw public of minors' profiles, photos, and geoloc data, and claim that the app ""enabled"" sexual predat to find their victims. The citi cite sever case involv adult men and minor in which MeetM wa used. MeetM settl the case for $200,000 the follow year, agre to clarifi and simplifi it user agreement and settings, and reduc the amount of data display on minor to their citi and state.But the case involv MeetM didn't ceas -- last February, a Buffalo man wa charg with multipl count of child pornographi after use MeetM to find minors. MeetMe' troubl rais red flag at Tinder, which hike it age limit from 13 to 18 last June. Yet MeetM still hasn't follow suit, presum becaus it would lose a larg portion of it users.2. The potenti loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big compani would be reluct to advertis on MeetMe, but plenti of big brand still advertis on the app. That' becaus MeetM gener most of it ad revenu from programmat ad deliv byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.Thi mean that MoPub' custom simpli pick a demograph -- in MeetMe' case, younger user and Millenni -- and the platform feed the ad to variou apps. Thi mean that mani compani probabl don't realiz that their ad are appear on MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesi is that MoPub could decid to drop MeetM due to violat of it term of service, or advertis could ask MoPub to pull their ad from the controversi app. There' no evid either of these scenario will occur, but it rais a troubl question -- if MeetMe' reput worsens, can it still keep grow it ad revenues?3. Be boot from the app storesIn it 10-K file for fiscal 2015, MeetM admit that it busi will suffer if it is ""unabl to maintain a good relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet' Google. It note that it app could be pull from their app store ""if we violate"" or the compani believ ""that we have violated"" their term and conditions.Th bull might believ that' just a typic ""risk factor"" warning, but MeetM admit in the same file that ""on more than one occasion,"" Appl reject it app ""becaus of user gener content and other concerns."" Thi indic that anoth high-profil lawsuit could knock MeetM out of the app store and kill it business.4. Tinder is crush MeetMeMeetM arriv befor Tinder, which wa initi launch in 2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetM wane in correl with Tinder' growth, as seen in thi chart from Googl Trends:Imag source: Google.That declin also explain whi MeetM acquir it competitor Skout last October. That move boost the company' MAU count from about 5 million to 8.5 million, and greatli inflat MeetMe' top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insid confidenceIf MeetM is as undervalu as the fundament suggest, you'd expect insid to be load up on shares. However, MeetM CEO Geoffrey Cook just sold 250,000 share (16% of hi entir position) at an averag price of $5.02.Includ Cook' sales, insid sold 1.96 million share over the past 12 months, but onli bought 334,000 shares. It' understand that MeetMe' insid would sell after the stock' 50% ralli over the past 12 months, but it also indic that it upsid potenti could be limited.Th key takeawayTh main lesson here is to alway look beyond the valuat and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetM look like a rapidli grow social app maker trade at a discount to it peers. But dig deeper, and you'll see an app that' struggl to prove that it' not a tool for crimin while remain relev against Tinder, which domin the space with over 50 million activ users.10 stock we like better than MeetMeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Expedia Inc Will Profit From This Global Market Trend (EXPE),1/31/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA an analyst who spend everi day look at numbers, I have a tendenc to tri and quantifi everything. We humans, as a species, tend to do thi all the time.makeArticleAd();For the most part, it serv us well. But it can also sometim be a trap, diminish the valu of what is simpli unquantifiable.I learn thi lesson a few year ago on a trip to the green highland and snow-cap mountain of Peru.Dur the plan phase, I contempl everi detail of the trip, from number of hour spent on flights… night spent in hotels… how mani site I could see within a certain amount of time. Everyth had to be just perfect.But even dure the earli phase of the journey, I found myself counting…Ther were four gruel day of hiking. At about 20.5 mile in total length, it took four day to complete. Each night, we camp at about 13,000 feet. And at the summit of our hike, we would reach 14,928 feet.Strenu hike at such a high elev for such an extend period of time meant that everi breath, everi step, wa a labori effort. But we press on, young and old, encourag each other and offer a help hand until we reach the end of our journey. And best of all, we knew that each painstak step meant that we were just that closer to see one of the most truli remark sight in the world: the ancient Incan citi of Machu Picchu.It wa onli dure those littl moment when I wa abl to move past thi tendenc to quantifi everyth that I truli lost myself in the mysteri and wonder the world ha to offer.Hopefully, you'v had the chanc to have experi like thi at some point in your life, too. All too often, we in the develop world tend to take for grant the fact that most of us have the mean to do these kind of things.7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 2018But there are hundr of million of peopl who don't - but they soon will.Th World' Burgeon Middl ClassGlob demand for travel is surging. Hundr of million of peopl are enter the global middl class right now and in the year to come. One of the first thing these peopl will look to do is travel.Bi 2030, two-third of the global middl class will be resid of the Asia-Pacif region. That' up from just under one-third in 2009. And China alon is expect to have a stagger one billion member of the middl class by then.China' bud middl class is alreadi travel in greater number than ever before. A Unit Nation tourism report show that the number of Chines citizen travel oversea ha surg from 10 million in 2000 to more than 83 million in 2013.Thi is a huge opportun for the onlin travel business. Consum in the Asia-Pacif region current book onli about 27% of their travel online, while Latin America lag even further at 21%. In China, onli about 15% of consum current book their travel online. Thi is compar to rate over 50% in the Unit State and Europe.It' not hard to imagin that the rest of the world will quickli catch up to the Unit State and Europ in term of book their travel online. And that set up a tremend opportunity.That' where my colleagu Jimmi Butt come in with one of hi most recent pick in hi premium newsletter,Top Stock Advisor…How To Profit From Thi TrendIn last month' issu of hi newsletter, Jimmi report on the incred growth of the onlin travel market. Cite much of the inform I referenc above, he went on to recommend two publicly-trad onlin travel companies.I don't like to make a habit of give away too mani pick from our premium publications, sinc our subscrib pay good money for thi inform (to learn how to subscribe,go here). But I can reveal that one of them isExpedia Inc(EXPE), the world' largest onlin travel company.Surg industri growth is reflect in Expedia' gross bookings. In 2015, the compani book a stagger $60 billion worth of flights, hotels, rental car and cruises. It' on track to crush those figur in 2016, alreadi rack up gross book of more than $56 billion through the first nine month of thi year, which is 23% more compar with the first nine month of 2015.Expedia ha made major stride in the intern market. In 2005, intern revenu made up onli 22% of it portfolio; last year that soar to approxim 45%. But that' just the tip of the iceberg in term of potenti for growth. Despit be the largest player in onlin travel, the compani still ha onli a 4% share of the global market.Thi speak to the highly-frag natur of the market, but also for the potenti to grow through acquisitions, which Expedia ha been do for some time now already. Between the growth in the global middl class and growth in the onlin travel market, Jimmi think Expedia should benefit greatli over the next 5-10 years.A such, it' a good long-term hold to consid ad to your portfolio.3 Thing Appl Inc.

But it ha a hold on 50% of the onlin travel market in China - which by all account should be the prime growth market in in the year ahead.Whil the real valu of travel may not be quantifiable, investor who back thi compani now could be count sizeabl gain within a few years.

XOM' numbers, $1.7 billion in net incom and 41 cent per share, badli trail analyst estim of 68 cents. But the top-line, $61 billion in revenue, wa about a half-billion abov those estimates.For the year, the compani earn $7.84 billion, $1.88 per share. Thi sound impressive, but it' less than half of 2015' $16.15 billion in earnings, and that in turn wa half of 2014' $32.52 billion. The initi respons of trader wa cautious, with Exxon stock open onli slightli below the previou day' close of $84.86 per share.Th question for XOM stock investor remains, is thi the bottom, and how quick might the turn be?Exxon Stock Is Hang In ThereTh year 2016 wa a year that XOM stock had to hang in and tough thing out. The earn releas emphas that cash flow and asset sale cover the dividend of 75 cent per share. The dividend cost the compani about $3 billion per quarter, and the quarterli earn continu to come up short of that mark.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatTh compani ha kept earn posit by cut back sharpli on capit expenditures. It spent $4.83 billion dure the fourth quarter, against $7.42 billion a year earlier. For the year, Exxon invest $19.30 billion, against $31.05 billion in 2015.Thi ha yet to have a big impact on production, which wa down just 3%, or 127,000 barrel per day, from 2015' figur dure the fourth quarter, with new volum in Nigeria and Indonesia partli make up for the declin product of U.S. fields. The compani lost $2.3 billion produc oil, which it call ""upstream"" operations, and $1.2 billion refin and sell it, which it call ""downstream"" operations.

Sprout is draw custom from the grow natur and organ food segment — and it price it good below that of it notabl peer, Whole Food Market. As a result, some analyst see the compani gener mid-teen earn and revenu growth in the forese future.Th compani is grow out of it base in the American Southwest and move east, grow 14 percent in squar footag everi year. Coupl with it favor market segments, Sprout is gener posit cash flow and return cash to sharehold via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 time estim 2017 earnings, the stock could be readi to move.13. Delta Air Lines:DALDelta Air Line ha greatli improv it financi perform but still trade at a typic airlin multipl of about nine time estim 2017 earnings. Sinc 2009, Delta ha work to cut it debt in half. As a result, it now ha an invest grade rate from independ rate servic Moody's. To further entic shareholders, Delta pay a 1.7 percent dividend and ha aggress repurchas stock.Delta manag feel the stock should be valu more like a diversifi industri company, which would dramat rais it multiple, and, therefore, it share price. If you need anoth short-term catalyst, look at the company' free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machin — it gener $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 month alon and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, accord to Forbes.14. Novartis:NVTSAnoth valu play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversifi drug compani and the world' biggest prescript drugmaker.

With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novarti ha an analyst consensu price target of $87, some $15 north of it current price.Part of what held Novarti back in 2016 wa fear over the slow start of Entresto, it heart-failur drug, but some analyst think sale will soon acceler and could go as high as $3 billion. Novarti also get 25 percent of it sale from high-growth, emerg markets, which make it less depend on the more matur U.S. drug market. The company' recent purchas of Encor Vision should also shore up it vision sale and further enabl it to diversifi it holdings.15. Gener Motors:GMGener Motor ha been an integr part of the global auto industri for more than 100 year and ha recent face headwinds. Some market particip feel that global auto sale have peaked, and concern over themov to electr vehicleshav held back GM stock. Whatev the reason are, Gener Motor current trade at a low price-to-earn ratio of 4.3. Even industri competitor — like Ford, which trade at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trade at 9.7 time — trade at higher multiples, and GM' averag price-earn ratio over the past five year is 12.2.GM could move higher as the market appreci it emerg electr and hybrid portfolio. Some analyst feel GM ha the bankrol and technolog to undersel rival such as Tesla and perhap even compet on qualiti at some point.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings,1/31/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsEven ifAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest compani in the world (a measur by market cap), it quarterli earn report would still arguabl be the most-watch report for ani given earn seasons. Not onli are a wide swath of mani other compani link to Apple' success, but AAPL stock itself is someth of a baromet for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterli earn announc have also rais questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania ha run it course. The growth pace ha been undeni taper off.That' go to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Appl earn report for it fiscal first quarter is due.Appl Earn PreviewA of the most recent look, Appl isexpect to post earn of $3.22 per shareon revenu of $77.42 billion for the quarter end in December. The compani itself had guid for Q1 revenu of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock report for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year' first fiscal quarter talli of $75.87 billion.Appl need a strong show on Tuesday. Although it ha been a strong growth machin sinc unveil the first iPhon a littl over a decad ago, per-shar profit have been lower on a year-over-year basi in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatAAPL stock investor have been patient thu far, give CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a matur market. A shortfal and/or anoth quarter of shrink numbers, however, may push those traders' patienc over the edge.3 Thing to Watch for AAPLNot that Appl doesn't have a myriad of thing go on at ani given time, but for the most part, investor tend to focu on what they perceiv as the biggest three. The three item that will be do most of the drive for AAPL stock after Tuesday' report are (in no particular order)…iPhon 7 salesIt' the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sale of the company' flagship devic can cure all other ills, but if sale of the company' most recent iter of the iPhon fall short, littl els matters.Expect are wide vari on thi front too. Cowen & Co.think Appl sold 58.5 million unit of the iPhon 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believ Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhon 7 - dure it fiscal Q1. The overal consensus, though, isan averag of 77.3 million units. Presum most of those are the 7 and 7 Plu models.App and Digit ContentWhil Appl use to be a hardwar compani that also happen to facilit the purchas of smartphon apps, music and video media, digit content is increasingli becomingan import part of the revenu mixa satur becom a real issue.Th compani doesn't offer much in the way of expect for how it revenu break down, but we do know that in the previou quarter, Appl enjoy revenu of $6.3 billion for it ""Services"" division, which is mostli made up of it video, audio and app arms. That wa a 24% year-over-year improvement. That make it thesecond-biggest categori of product for Apple, though it' still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Tim High or New Problems?AAPL is even mull the creation ofit own origin televis show and movies, follow in the footstep of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remain to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discuss within the Appl earn report and confer call. Mayb it won't come up at all, but there' no deni AAPL is one of the more vulner compani to Presid Donald Trump' polici plans.Not onli might a strict foreign worker and immigr polici limit Apple' access to technic talent, but much-discuss tariff on Chinese-mad import could start a trade war that leav Appl right in the middl of it. Not onli doe Appl sell product to Chines consumers, it reli on China to make mani of the iPhone' key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trail P/E of 14.5, Appl share are price fairli … mayb even undervalued. That' apt to be a larg part of the reason the pro are collect rate AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (lean toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspici in light of the lacklust result we'v seen for the prior three quarters. Appl is go to have to outperform most expect if the stock' to build ani further on the 34% gain it ha muster sinc May of last year.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stock Ripe For A Short SqueezeTh post3 Thing Appl Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?,1/30/2017,"Share ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recent plung to a multi-month low after the chipmak wa hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andaddit lawsuitsfrom it longtim customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclus use Qualcomm' baseband modem in it iPhon between 2011 and 2016, claim that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebat payment (compens for that deal) after it cooper with Korean FTC regulators, which were probe Qualcomm.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Thi strain relationship between the two tech giant sound like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which start suppli Appl with modem for the iPhon 7 after it exclus deal with Qualcomm ended. The reason is simpl -- Appl could potenti buy all of it modem from Intel if it sever it relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel share bare budg after Appl su Qualcomm, and onli recent ralli follow it fourth quarter earn beat. Let' take a closer look at whi investor don't seem convinc that Qualcomm' pain can gener signific gain for Intel.Understand Intel' mobil strategyIntel doesn't report it modem sale separately. They'r includ in it massiv Client Comput Group, which includ PC and mobil chips. The group wa creat in 2015 to divert attent from the ongo loss at it mobil division, which previous report it result separately. Those loss were caus by it gener subsid of OEMs, with co-market agreements, steep discounts, and financi aid for use it mobil Atom chipsets.Bi the timeIntel kill offmost of it mobil Atom chip last year, the unit had spent billion of dollar to captur just 1% of the market. Intel' fatal mistak are easi to see in retrospect -- it sold off it ARM-bas Xscale unit in 2006 to focu on x86 chip in 2006, then reject Apple' offer to produc applic processor for the first iPhone.Sinc much of the Android market use Qualcomm SoCs, which bundl baseband modem togeth with ARM-bas processors, Intel realiz that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobil market. Instead, it had to develop modem for OEM like Apple, which develop their own ARM-bas processor without integr modems.Imag source: Apple.Whi Intel investor aren't excitedTh problem with Intel is that it wa like negoti term with Appl from a posit of weakness, due to it need to stay relev in the mobil market. Sinc Intel ha a long record of take loss to gain market share in the mobil market, it' reason to assum that Intel sold it modem to Appl at veri favor price for the hardwar maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analyst estim that the deal could gener $1.5 billion in revenu for Intel -- which would onli equal 2.5% of it project revenu thi year. Even if Appl drop Qualcomm and doubl it order from Intel, that growth wouldn't significantli offset Intel' sluggish growth in PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modem would like onli gener low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantli boost it bottom line growth.To make matter worse, Appl throttl the speed of Qualcomm modem in the iPhon 7 to match the slower speed of the Intel modems. Thi indic that Appl didn't choos Intel chip becaus they could match Qualcomm' -- it like onli did so to reduc Qualcomm' negoti power. Thi mean that other OEM that use stand-alon Qualcomm modem won't like switch over to Intel modem anytim soon. Thi misstep mirror Intel' failur in mobil applic processor -- sever OEM initi gave the Atom a chance, but it wa doom by it inabl to match the power effici of ARM-bas designs.What Intel investor should expectIntel investor shouldn't assum that Apple' battl with Qualcomm indic that the two longtim partner will part way anytim soon. Appl andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been su each other for years, yet the Korean tech giant is still one of it top suppliers. Therefore, Appl is like tri to get Qualcomm to lower it chip price and licens fee instead of complet part way with the chipmaker.Even if Appl abandon Qualcomm, investor shouldn't assum that Intel will inherit the entir modem business. Appl often split compon order from multipl manufacturers, and it ha enough resourc to develop it own modem -- which would cut both Intel and Qualcomm out of the loop.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them!

How Much Can Apple's Services Drive Profit Growth?,1/30/2017,"Imag source: Apple.Much ha been made ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) servic revenu over the last year or so. After it wa clear Appl would struggl to continu grow iPhon sale follow the outstand success of the iPhon 6, CEO Tim Cook comment that a ""grow portion of our revenu is directli driven by our exist instal base."" That is, sale of apps, content, iCloud, Appl Care, and other Appl Servic will account for an outsiz portion of Apple' revenu growth go forward.makeArticleAd();To be clear, Appl is still veri much a hardwar company. Apple' servic revenu account for just 11% of Apple' total sale in fiscal 2016. The iPhone, by comparison, made up 63% of revenue. But servic revenu grew 22% last year, faster than ani other segment.With stall hardwar sale growth, investor may be wonder if grow servic revenu is enough to move the needl on Apple' bottom line.Al about the marginsDespit it rel small size, Apple' servic busi gener higher margin than it hardwar sales. That' simpli the natur of software, which see wider margin as product reach scale. And veri few compani have the scale of Apple; the compani ha over 1 billion devic in use.Apple' App Store sale have a gross margin of about 90%, accord to estim from Macquari Secur analyst Ben Schachter. Overall, he estim the rest of Apple' servic have a gross margin of 65%. That mean Apple' servic revenu ha a gross margin about twice as larg as it hardwar sales.Importantly, the App Store -- Apple' highest-margin product -- is one of the fastest-grow piec of Apple' services. Last year, App Store revenueclimb over 33%. Schachter expect it to climb 28% on averag over the next five year while non-App Store servic grow just 10% annually. That mean Apple' servic margin will continu to expand.How it all impact Apple' gross profitEven if hardwar sale remain flat, that won't prevent Appl from expand it instal base. As Cook mention in the company' first-quart earn call last year, ""Becaus of the endur valu of the device, their replac is like higher to be given or sold to someon who will also love and use it often."" In other words, even if Appl isn't sell more devic directli to consumers, the user base can grow through third-parti resal or gifting.A grow user base combin with grow servic sale per unit ought to continu drive revenu growth for the segment for sever more years.A dollar in sale growth from servic will carri twice the gross profit, on average, as a dollar in sale growth of Apple' hardware. So, even though servic is a rel small busi right now, it outpunch it weight class, provid approxim 21% of gross profit in 2016. That number is set to expand as more of Apple' sale growth come from services.A an illustr of the impact of Apple' servic revenu growth, a 20% increas in servic revenu in fiscal 2017 would result in about a 4% increas in the company' total gross profit and a 70 basi point expans in gross margin if all els remain equal. Consid the size of Apple, that' pretti signific growth. Schachter estim Apple' gross margin will expand as much as 400 basi point over the next five years.Gross margin expans combin with modest revenu growth and share buyback should continu to boost Apple' earn per share at a fairli steadi pace. Analyst expect 13.8% EP growth over the next five years, but there could be even more upsid depend on how much margin expand. With share trade at a price-to-earn ratio of just 14.4, share may still be undervalu if Appl can maintain hardwar sale and continu grow servic revenu as expected.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If we see thi trend continu in the come day as the rest of Q4 report come in, then it would mean that estim like hadn't drop enough ahead of the start of thi earn season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher thi time around rel to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earn season scorecard, we now have result from 171 S&P 500 member that have report as of Januari 30th. Total earn for these 171 index member are up +6% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beat EP estim and 54.4% beat revenu estimates. We discuss earlier how the proport of compani beat EP and revenu estim ha been track below histor periods. But we don't have that issu on the growth front, with both earn and revenu growth track abov other histor period for the same group of 171 index members.Th chart below show how the Q4 earn and revenu growth rate for these 171 compani compar with other recent periods.Th Financ sector is a big contributor to the aggreg growth pictur at thi stage.

Total earn for these Financ sector compani are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 67.5% beat EP estim and 45% beat revenu estimates. Exclud the Financ sector from the result thu far, total earn for the rest of the S&P 500 compani that have report would be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues. Thi is still better growth than we have seen from the same group of ex-Fin S&P 500 members, as the comparison chart below shows.Look at Q4 as a whole, combin the actual result from the 171 index member that have report result with estim from the still-to-com 329 companies, total earn for the S&P 500 index are expect to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues.

3 Stocks That Could Move Big This Week,1/30/2017,"Thi week,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) are all schedul to report result for their most recent end quarter, make thi one of the most interest week of thi earn season. With Appl on deck, here' whi these stock could be big movers.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Search for growthSchedul to report result for it fiscal first-quart of 2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31, investor will like be watch a number of key item closely. But Apple' top line for the current quarter, and the company' guidanc for revenu in it second fiscal quarter of 2017, will like be the main driver behind ani move in the stock price after the result go live.For it first quarter, Appl guid for revenu of $76 billion to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Investor will be look for Appl to meet or exceed it guidanc range, particularli sinc Appl ha report year-over-year revenu declin in the last three quarters. Revenu in thi rang would mark an all-tim high for the company.For Apple' second-quart revenu guidance, the number for Appl to beat will be it fiscal second-quart revenu in 2016 of $50.6 billion. Anyth less than thi figur would mean the tech giant expect to return to year-over-year decline.Can thi tech giant keep up it momentum?For Facebook' fourth-quart earn releas on Wednesday, Feb. 1, investor will also like be hone in on the company' report revenue, though expect for Facebook' growth are far more optimist than what investor expect from Appl these days. While it' unrealist to expect Facebook to report the same 56% year-over-year revenu growth it report in Q3 given the company' tough year-ago comparison of 44% year-over-year revenu growth, investor will like look for ani deceler in revenu growth to be modest. I'll be look for fourth-quart revenu growth of about 45%.Imag source: Amazon.Beyond Facebook' revenu growth, anoth area that could move the stock is the company' report user metrics. While ani surpris on user metric are unlik consid the company' consist upward march in monthli activ user and user engagement, a sudden pullback in user growth or engag could spook some investors. Investor should look for the social network' monthli activ user to increas about three to four percent sequenti and it user engagement, or daili activ user as a percentag of monthli activ users, to be 66% or better -- figur that would maintain recent user perform trends.Can holiday sale live up to big expectations?Go into Amazon' Feb. 2 fourth-quart report, manag didn't provid a veri narrow guidanc rang for expect revenu growth. Amazon said it expect revenu to increas anywher between 17% to 27% year over year. Thi wide rang for potenti net sale growth for the quarter will like have mani investor watch the import holiday quarter' revenue.Analyst are bet Amazon' sale for the quarter will fall at the high end of management' guidance, accord to analyst estim compil by Thomson Reuters. On average, analyst are expect net sale of $44.7 billion, up 25% year over year.If ani of these compani under- or over-perform these expect by a meaning margin, these high-profil stock could make big moves. But investor should put ani move into the context of the companies' broader, big-pictur perform and their long-term potential; the market often lean toward shortsighted and can overreact to news. Still, ani signific deviat report from these key metric would like requir some further analysis.Find out whi Facebooki one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

With a project revenu between $76 billion and $78 billion dure Q1 FY2017, Appl should make a smooth bounc back, both sequenti as well as year-on-year.2. RepatriationWhil Appl is cash rich, 90% of it is held by it foreign subsidiari outsid the U.S. to avoid the heavi taxat on repatriation. Now, with Donald Trump as U.S. President, there is the possibl that a one-tim tax of 10% on repatri may be levi to encourag compani to bring back trillion of dollar of money to the American soil.Mor than a decad back, a similar one-tim tax holiday on repatri wa provid under the Homeland Invest Act of 2004.

Further, as 2017 mark the 10th anniversari of iPhone’ debut, there is great excit build around it next iPhon model.“Th iPhon set the standard for mobil comput in it first decad and we are just get started. The best is yet to come,”saidTim Cook, Apple’ CEO.5. Research & DevelopmentAppl is known for keep it project under wraps, however, it increas spend on research and development, from $4.5 billion in 2013 to $10 billion in 2016, display it commit to innov and evolv new technolog that enhanc and expand it exist product range.Appl is now focus on advanc technolog area such as artifici intelligence, machin learning, virtual and augment reality, and automation.

Wall Street is expect $3.22 per share compar to last year' $3.28 per share, and that fall is despit expect for a slight uptick in revenue.Appl ha suffer sever straight quarter of fall sales, but analyst expect a strong holiday season driven by the iPhon 7 to return the compani to organ growth. Even if that growth is meager and earn shrink slightly, I expect investor to be pleased.Remember, Appl is no longer the growth darl it onc was. But 20% gain over the last year plu a solid dividend make a pretti strong case for the stock. I think investor will be remind of the new Apple' appeal when earn are releas tomorrow.Earn to Watch:Advanc Micro Devic (AMD)Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrAdvanc Micro Devic is anoth compani that doesn't have too much growth in it near-term forecast despit sale growth.

But I do like AMD' long-term prospects, as it' introduc new product and ink new partnership and deals, includ one withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL.7 Aw Stock You Need To Ditch Right AwayIf AMD happen to get batter after it earn report Tuesday, I wouldn't hesit to buy some share on the cheap.Earn to Watch:Und Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockUnd Armour is the onli stock on thi list that ha earn growth on-tap for the current quarter.

What to Expect When Cirrus Logic Inc. Reports Earnings This Wednesday,1/30/2017,"Imag Source: Cirru LogicWhen audio codec supplierCirru Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) releas it fiscal 2017 third quarter result on Feb. 1, investor can expect anoth period of rapid growth from the company. Cirru Logic ha benefit fromApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) decis to remov the headphon jack from the latest gener of iPhones, lead to strong sale of it wireless headset solutions. Thi should drive a strong quarterli perform at Cirrus, but the company' over-depend on Appl for 78% of it revenu could be a deal-break as far as the broad investor outlook is concerned.makeArticleAd();Appl will drive strong growth for Cirru in the third quarter . . .Cirru expect to post third quarter revenu of $475 million to $515 million with a gross margin of 48%. The midpoint of thi guidanc put it year-over-year growth at an impress 42%, which is not surpris given the content gain that Cirru ha wit in the iPhon 7.A teardown of the latest smartphon by Chipwork reveal that the devic use three audio amplifi from Cirrus, as compar to two in the iPhon 6S. Now, the actual devic is not the onli place where Cirru is go to make money. iFixit' X-ray of the Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, use to connect legaci headphon to the iPhon 7, reveal the presenc of audio codec from Cirru as well.What' more, Cirru ha also suppli digital-to-analog convert chip for the Lightn EarPods, accord to a teardown of the devic by the Vietnames site Tinhte. All of thi indic that Cirru ha receiv a seriou bump in it chip content at Apple. In fact, Pacif Crest Secur forecast addit content gain of $2.50 for Cirru Logic with the iPhon 7, includ the Lightn EarPod and the second stereo speaker.Encourag by the boom business, Cirru seem to have direct most of it manufactur capac toward make chip for the iPhon and relat accessories. Thi is whi revenu from it largest custom shot up to 78% of total sale in the Juli to Septemb quarter, when iPhon product wa be ramp up, as compar to 63% in the year-ago period.iPhon order from supplier for the Decemb quarter reportedli stood at 89 million units. Now, the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu won't account for 100% of Apple' devic sales. To provid some perspective, sale of these two model reportedli made up 72% of total iPhon sale in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, accord to Consum Intellig Research Partners.Assum that 72% of the 89 million iPhon unit order Appl place in the fourth quarter were for the two new devices, that would account for approxim 64 million units. Multipli thi estim unit count by addit content gain of $2.50 for each device, Cirru revenu would increas by $160 million from the prior-year period when it report total revenu of $348 million.Thi alon put Cirru revenu at about $508 million for the fiscal third quarter, which fall at the higher end of it guidanc range. But apart from the dollar content gains, Cirru will also benefit from the product of an addit nine million iPhon unit as compar to the Dec. 2015 quarter, when estim volum stood at 80 million. Therefore, Cirru is pois to outperform even the higher end of it guidanc range.. . . but hurt it longer term outlookHowever, Cirru Logic' outlook could prove to be a problem as iPhon product in the first calendar quarter of 2017 is expect to declin to about 42 million units, as indic by aUBSreport. Earlier, Appl wa expect to produc 43 million iPhon dure the period, but it ha reportedli downsiz product in order to avoid an inventori glut.Assum the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu maintain a 72% share of overal production, these two devic will account for approxim 30 million unit in the current quarter. With the $2.50 per unit of addit content, the new devic will add $75 million to Cirrus' top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.To factor in the lower product volume, iPhon build in the year-ago quarter stood at an estim 55 million units. Thi put the anticip year-over-year declin in volum at 13 million units. Assum that the product cut pertain to the older iPhon 6S, Cirrus' revenu could drop by as much as $45 million sinc it wa make $3.50 on each unit of the prior gener device.Therefore, the revenu gain from the iPhon 7 will be reduc to just $30 million after account for the declin in overal production. Thi indic that Cirru could post sale of approxim $262 million in the fiscal fourth quarter as it revenu in the prior-year period wa $232 million. Bar major gain in other busi areas, Wall Street analyst estim of between $312 million and $350 million in fiscal fourth quarter revenu will be tough to beat.Thi tough outlook could lead to a potenti sell-off sinc investor will consid book profit as Cirru Logic share have alreadi doubl in the past year.

Can Apple (AAPL) be a Suitable Value Pick at the Moment?,1/30/2017,"Valu invest is easili one of the most popular way to find great stock in ani market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stock that are either fli under the radar and are compel buys, or offer up tantal discount when compar to fair value?makeArticleAd();On way to find these compani is by look at sever key metric and financi ratios, mani of which are crucial in the valu stock select process. Let' putAppl Inc.AAPLstock into thi equat and find out if it is a good choic for value-ori investor right now, or if investor subscrib to thi methodolog should look elsewher for top picks:P RatioA key metric that valu investor alway look at is the Price to Earn Ratio, or PE for short. Thi show us how much investor are will to pay for each dollar of earn in a given stock, and is easili one of the most popular financi ratio in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compar the stock' current PE ratio with: a) where thi ratio ha been in the past; b) how it compar to the averag for the industry/sector; and c) how it compar to the market as a whole.On thi front, Appl ha a trail twelv month PE ratio of 14.75. Thi level compar favor with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 come in at about 20.11.If we focu on the long-term PE trend, Apple' current PE level put it slightli abov it midpoint over the past five years, with the number have risen rapidli over the past few months. Hence, thi doe not provid us with a conclus direct as to the rel valuat of the stock in comparison to it own histor trend.Meanwhile, the stock' PE compar favor with the Zack classifi Comput & Technolog sector' trail twelv month PE ratio, which stand at 22.08. At the veri least, thi indic that the stock is rel undervalu right now, compar to it peers.W should also point out that Appl ha a forward PE ratio (price rel to thi year' earnings) of just 13.70, so it is fair to say that a slightli more value-ori path may be ahead forAppl stockin the near term too.P/ RatioAnoth key metric to note is the Price/Sal ratio. Thi approach compar a given stock' price to it total sales, where a lower read is gener consid better. Some peopl like thi metric more than other value-focus one becaus it look at sales, someth that is far harder to manipul with account trick than earnings.Right now, Appl ha a P/ ratio of about 3.05. Thi is a bit higher than the Comput & Technolog sector' average, which come in at 2.96 right now. In fact, over the last year, Apple' figur ha been quit close to the sector' average, as we can see in the chart below:However, the current level lie near to the median of the stock' own histor trend (which stand at 2.93). Thi again doe not provid us with ani conclus direct as to the rel valuat of the stock in comparison to it own trend.Broad Valu OutlookIn aggregate, Appl current ha a Zack Valu Style Score of 'B', put it into the top 40% of all stock we cover from thi look. Thi make Appl a solid choic for valu investors, and some of it other key metric make thi pretti clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Appl is just 1.20, a level that is far lower than the industri averag of 5.06. The PEG ratio is a modifi PE ratio that take into account the stock' earn growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choic on the valu front from multipl angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Appl might be a good choic for valu investors, there are plenti of other factor to consid befor invest in thi name. In particular, it is worth note that the compani ha a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'F'. Thi give AAPL a Zack VGM score-or it overarch fundament grade-of 'D'. (You can read more about the Zack Style Scoresher >>)Meanwhile, the company' recent earn estim have been trend downward slightly. The current quarter ha seen one estim go higher in the past sixti day compar to three lower, while the full year estim ha seen one upward revis and eight downward revis in the same time period.Thi ha had just a small impact on the consensu estim though as the current quarter consensu estim ha inch lower by 0.3% in the past two months, while the full year estim ha declin nearli 2%. You can see the consensu estim trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Appl Inc. Price and ConsensusAppl Inc. Price and Consensus|Appl Inc. QuoteThi somewhat dull trend is whi the stock ha just a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) and whi we are look for in-lin perform from the compani in the near term.Bottom LineAppl form a part of the Zack Computer-Mini industry. The industri is highli competit and thu Appl face signific competit in most of it oper market from respect segment leader like Hewlett-Packard, Google, Samsung, etc. Moreover, the demand for high-end devic ha been soft recently, owe to global macroeconom weakness, especi with currenc volatil and declin commod price in some key region across the globe.In fact, over the past two years, the Zack Computer-Mini industri ha clearli underperform the broader market, as you can see below:Appl is an inspir choic for valu investors, as it is hard to beat it incred lineup of statist on thi front. However, with a sluggish industri rank (Bottom 14% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zack Rank #3, it is hard to get too excit about thi compani overall.So, valu investor might want to wait for estim and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in thi name first, but onc that happens, thi stock could be a compel pick.Zacks' Top Invest Idea for Long-Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommend to help you find today' most promis long-term stocks?

Tim Cook ha turn out to be a game manag for AAPL stock. That' not a slight against him, but a game manag come in when your first-str QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Appl need a visionary. There' no replac Steve Jobs, and be a game manag in a sector that move like lightn is not what the compani needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock gener almost 70% of revenu from the iPhone, and that product is see increas competition.Th good news is that Appl ha well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can liter do anyth it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck oversea - although that may chang under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Appl would probabl have to make acquisit in rapidli grow companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can ventur into, one that I'v been say it must get into: origin content.7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 2018New ha surfac that AAPL is final look serious at creat origin TV and film content. For years, Appl ha beg off of thi direction. It seem content to play around with music streaming, and licens content from other provid for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""Th technolog giant ha been in talk with veteran produc in recent month about buy right to script televis programs. It also ha approach experienc market execut at studio and network to discuss hire them to promot it content, said peopl with knowledg of the discussions. In addit to TV, Appl indic to these peopl that it is consid offer origin movies, though those plan are more preliminary. Execut at Appl have told peopl in Hollywood they hope to start offer origin script content by the end of 2017.""The appl is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a veri big way. We'v seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) ha shift it model toward origin program and is produc realli great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTub Red, though, is kind of flounder right now.On thing peopl want is not onli more content, but good content. Becaus Appl is so flush with cash, it can liter do anyth in thi arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so mani model to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Appl would want to creat high qualiti TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issu of stream content alone. If Appl wanted, it could produc featur films, and buy out ani of the exist movi theatr chain and rebrand it as an Appl Theatr experience, and drop in all manner of synergi like this.Th concept of the ""long tail"" is still veri much in play, so creat independ work for a price, or return to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mine new talent from film school and user-gener geniu that' all over the place.Th emerg technolog of VR is anoth place to stretch. The abil to curat fulli engag experi via VR, and develop technolog that allow player to wear bodysuit permit them to actual experi touch in these game is the next frontier.Can Appl Inc.

It could becom a multi-platform creator of content, and be abl to engag peopl from all over the world.I thi is a blockbust revenu gener for Appl stock? It' way too earli to tell.

""Expect to see ad revenu growth rate come down meaningfully,"" execut warn in earli November. That' no surprise, given that advertis ha jump at a 50% pace over the past few years.Th compani doesn't have much more room to increas the volum of ad that it drop into users' timelines, though, and so further gain will like come from thing like increas engagement, which don't pack the same punch as scaled-up delivery.

How Skyworks Solutions Inc Is Growing Beyond Apple,1/29/2017,"Imag source: Skywork Solutions.Skywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) investor couldn't have ask for a better start to it fiscal 2017. A first quarterearn beatand a stronger outlook for the ongo quarter sent it stock soar to new 52-week highs, as it rose over 13% in a singl day.makeArticleAd();For the fiscal second quarter, Skywork believ that it revenu will grow 8% year-over-year to $840 million, exceed the consensu forecast of $818 million, while earn of $1.40 per share should significantli outpac analyst estim of $1.24 per share.Skywork also deliv some solid long-term takeaway in it latest quarter. The compani is now boast of design win at high-volum smartphon compani in China, as it is grow it revenu outsid ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Still, Appl reportedli contribut 40% of Skyworks' top line in fiscal 2016.However, the compani ha been gradual work toward win more busi from other clients, and it ha found some success.Grow beyond AppleSkyworks' busi outsid of Appl increas 8% in the last fiscal year, as Vivek Arya of Merril Lynch point out on the latest confer call. Though thi might not seem realli big right now, the fact that overal revenu fell 1.3% year-over-year in the first quarter make the growth beyond Appl a crucial factor for long-term success.In fiscal 2015, Appl wasreportedly44% of Skyworks' business. Thus, it can be assum that of Skyworks' total revenu of $927 million in the first quarter of 2016, Appl contribut about $408 million of that. By comparison, the smartphon giant should have contribut $366 million to Skyworks' revenu (40% of $914 million) in the most recent report quarter. Thi indic that revenu from Appl fell about 10% year-over-year.That indic Skyworks' growth from other client power it revenu and earn beat last quarter. Thi is whi Skywork need to aggress pursu client diversif if it want to mitig the slowdown in busi with Apple.Diversifi in the right areasSkywork Solut is build an armi of client in China. One of the most promin name is Huawei. The compani ha been suppli it SkyBlu technolog to the Chines smartphon maker for it flagship Mate 9 smartphone. In fact, accord to Skywork CEO Liam Griffin, Huawei is now the company' second biggest client.Thi is a big deal for Skywork sinc Huawei is now a formid name in the smartphon industry. Accord to the latest data avail from IDC, Huawei' smartphon market share stood at 9.3%, trailingSamsung' 21% share and Apple' 12.5% share in the third quarter of 2016. More importantly, the Chines smartphon giant ha been sell more of it high and mid-rang phones, which account for 57% of it total shipments.With a higher share of Huawei' sale be driven by premium and mid-rang devices, it ha been abl to increas the averag sell price of it phones. When the compani had releas it 2015 results, it averag sell price of smartphon wa up 17% to $204 per unit. Though the compani ha not releas 2016 number yet, Huawei is capabl of increas it sell price onc again as it ha been introduc it flagship phone in global markets.Th higher averag sell price, along with higher volumes, is good news for Skywork sinc it will be abl to enhanc it dollar content in Huawei devices, which are in turn enjoy higher sell prices. Market research firm TrendForc point out that smartphon product will increas 4.5% thi year to 1.4 billion units. Chines smartphon compani will account for 634 million unit of thi production, with Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei be the biggest names. As Skywork count all three of them as clients, it will wit a rise in chip sale thi year as the top Chines smartphon compani are expect to sell 39% more phone in 2017 as compar to 2016.Therefore, higher compon demand by Chines compani to make more smartphon will push up Skyworks' averag sell prices, sinc it should be abl to charg a premium in the wake of tight supply. Skywork can also make up for the volum that it is lose due to Apple' slow iPhon sales, as it can now sell more compon to Chines smartphon makers.Mov beyond mobileSkyworks' opportun beyond mobile. Imag Source: Skywork Solutions.Th great thing about Skywork is that it is pursu opportun beyond mobil as well. The Internet of Things, or IoT, is one such opportun where the compani is aggress enhanc it presenc by launch new offerings.Skywork releas new front-end connect modul for machine-to-machin connect and IoT oper a few week ago. With it latest IoT product, Skywork should be abl to acceler the deploy of IoT applic by encourag migrat from 2G network due to it low cost and compact packaging.Thi product develop move by Skywork is a smart one, sinc the number of cellular devic commun with each other will rise from 300 million at present to around two billion by 2020, accord to GSMA. As the number of machine-to-machin connect increases, Skyworks' connect modul that enabl the IoT will gain more traction and lead to higher shipment volumes.However, the compani doe not singl out it revenu or shipment from the IoT segment, or ani segment for that matter. But the sheer growth in the size of thi market, coupl with the company' product develop efforts, should prove to be a tailwind in the long run.Th Foolish takeawaySkywork revenu is expect to increas 8.7% in the current fiscal year, follow by stronger growth of 10.5% next year. It appear to be pull the right string to diversifi it revenu away from heavili concentr client such as Apple, which seem to have hit it ownroadblocks. As a result, Skywork is well-posit for long-term success as it focus on market that have signific room for growth versu area approach saturation.10 stock we like better than Skywork SolutionsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple' 24% surg in servic revenu wa the lone bright spot, and no match for sell fewer iPhones, iPads, and Macs.Bul will argu that Tuesday' report will featur the first full quarter of avail for the iPhon 7 and Appl Watch Seri 2 after their Septemb debuts, but it wa also when the iPhon 6s came out a year earlier. The prior year wa also the first holiday season of Appl Watch availability.Unfortun for Apple, Wall Street' gotten better at forecast it financi performances. Appl use to routin blast through analyst profit target with eas when the iPad wa new and the iPhon wa all the rage dure the earli year of the mobil revolution. They'r get closer to the truth these days. Appl hasn't top Wall Street profit estim by more than 3% over the past year, and that' with the benefit of aggress share buyback prop up profit on a per-shar basis. Apple' outstand share count ha declin in each of the past four years.Analyst who have chime in with updat in the day lead up to Tuesday' report have been mixed. Mark Moskowitz at Barclay downgrad Appl from ""overweight"" to ""equal weight,"" concern about the upsid for all of 2017. He lower hi price target from $119 to $117, below where the stock is at now.Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbind Garcha check in a day later with a more upbeat take, but hi ""outperform"" rate and $150 price goal is base more on the potenti of the hyped-up iPhon 8 that should be releas later thi year than anyth that we will see in Tuesday' report.On can argu that the scene is set for Appl to shine. Analyst are look beyond the fiscal first quarter, and the stock hasn't kept up with the market sinc it last quarterli report. After three quarter of year-over-year revenu declines, even a token increas could give investor a chanc to exhale. The continu growth of servic revenu could ultim get net margin move in the right direct again. We won't have to wait long to see what Mr. Market thinks.

"Will Lawsuits Force Apple, Inc. To Prevent Texting And Driving?",1/29/2017,"Distract drive is a big and grow problem. In 2014, 3,179 American were kill in traffic accid involv driver divert their attent to activ like eating, talk on their phone, or texting. It' the third most deadli factor in modern car accidents, behind onli drunk drive and speeding.You'l be delight to hear that iPhon makerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha patent a way to reduc thi menace. But the patent solut is not yet implement on ani of Apple' devices.What gives? Let' have a look.makeArticleAd();What' new?Last week, a survivor of a distracted-driv incid file a class action lawsuit against Apple. The suit is not seek a big payout from Cupertino. Instead, it call for an injunct against sale of Appl devic in California until the compani implement it patent prevent method against text and drive on devic both new and alreadi sold.""If text and drive is a vessel of trouble, Appl is the captain of the ship,"" the court file states. ""The compani enjoy 40 percent of the smartphon market share -- far more than the nearest competitor. And it profit are enormous. Fortun Magazin report that in the third quarter of 2016, Appl gener 91% of the smartphon market' profits, equat to a cool $8.5 billion in net profit -- or about $95 million in profit per day.""So the suit argu that Appl play a signific part in the distract drive problem, and ha both a respons and the financi wherewith to do someth about it. Indeed, there is a tool on the table. The file cite an Applepatentfor disabl a mobil devic when it motion sensor and other system detect pattern consist with drive a car. File in 2008, when the ancientiPhon 3Gwa brand new, and approv by the Patent Offic in 2014, Appl ha had an eye on thi issu sinc the veri begin of it smartphon exploits.But again, nearli three year after that patent got an offici approval, the technolog remain unused.Thi lawsuit is not the first legal challeng to cite Apple' anti-distract patent. It' just the first one that primarili want to forc Apple' hand into do someth with thi allegedli life-sav technology. Other have been more concern with cash payment for damag done by iPhone-wield drivers.Imag source: US Patent and Trademark Office.Whi isn't Appl use thi patent yet?Mani fulli grant patent never see the light of day in a real-world implementation. Thi particular one could be among those for a varieti of good reasons. For example:Appl could be work on a better solut than the one describ in the '143 patent, but the new and improv solut isn't readi for a date with the Patent Offic yet.Th compani might have found flaw in it origin technology, which wa develop and file at a time when smartphon were a poorli understood novelty. Real-world experi and deeper research could have chang Apple' design requir in a hurry.Oth compani may have unveil better solut for the danger of distract driving, perhap as part of effort to come up with fulli autom drive platforms. Nearli everi major auto maker is on board with theautonom drivingtrend now, alongsid plenti of technolog experts. I'd be surpris to learn that Apple' effort from way back in 2008 provid a better solut than what all of Detroit and Silicon Valley could whip up nearli a decad later.That' just scratch the surfac of about a zillion reason not to take a patent technolog to market. I'm sure that Appl will come up with mani more if the lawsuit ever hit a courtroom.Imag source: Apple.What' next?No, I don't think that Appl will ever actual implement thi particular deterr to text and driving. Lawsuit won't chang that. Halt iPhon sale in California would be a power incentive, but Apple' top-shelf legal eagl can sure head that threat off at the pass. However, the fact that consum are stand up to ask Appl for help with thi conundrum could acceler Apple' arriv at a more complet solution.Th compani must balanc the benefit of a life-sav safeti featur against the risk that user might find the new restrict too overbearing. If your phone came with opt-in restrict on how you can use it in the driver' seat of a car, would you enabl them? If not, you'd be part of the problem. Therefore, thi is the kind of featur that need to be forc on the user with no obviou way to turn it off. Otherwise, the chang is not like to make a difference.Appl obvious doesn't want to push ani of it loyal user over to Android and other platforms, where they can continu their riski behavior unfettered. Ideally, the smartphon industri would come togeth and push out protect against text and driving. No fuss, no muss, and thousand of live potenti saved. Top-down regul would also do the trick, but that solut would also elicit pain groan of heavy-hand rule from everi compani in the mobil industry.Ther may not be a real solut to the distract drive problem until self-driv car go mainstream. Until then, lawsuit and concern user can onli hope to turn Apple' smartphon design in a safer direction.Don't hold your breath.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera,1/28/2017,"Invest in the tech sector can be tricky. Competit tend to be fierce, which make it difficult to stay one step ahead. Two compani that have a strong histori of maintain their edg areSkywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andInfinera(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these busi have been take market share in their industri for years, which is impressive. But which of these two tech compani is the better invest today? Let' review the bull thesi for each compani so we can make an inform decision.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th case for Skywork SolutionsSkywork design and build chip that allow devic to connect to each other. The company' semiconductor are found in a wide rang of product such as routers, tablets, cars, and smartphones.Whil thi industri is quit competitive, Skyworks' uniqu abil to creat custom and complex solut for it custom ha given it a big edg over rivals. In fact, Skywork chip can current be found in nearli all of the top-sel smartphon in the world, includ those made bySamsung, Xiaomi, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The massiv boom in smartphon sale over the last few year ha been a godsend for Skyworks. The company' revenue, margins, and profit have all soared, which ha taken long-term investor on a lucr ride.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the Internet of Thing ramp up and 5G technolog set to deploy, Skywork look well posit to continu deliv for investor from here. However, Skywork doe have an Achil heel that investor should be awar of. Appl is respons for more than 40% of Skyworks' total revenue, which is a bless and a curse. When iPhon sale are booming, Skyworks' result soar. However, when the Mac maker decid to reduc it channel inventory, Skywork reallyfeel the pain.Whil Skywork ha been sign deal in recent year to help reduc it custom concentration, Appl is such a huge compon of Skywork revenu that these two compani will remain attach at the hip -- for better or wors -- for the forese future.Th case for InfineraInfinera is a fast grow player in the optic network equip market. The company' product make internet provid live easier by allow them to easili (and cheaply) move vast quantiti of data around the globe.Lik Skyworks, Infinera ha also benefit from a number of tech trends. The rise of cloud comput and stream high-def video is make it difficult for provid to keep up with demand. That' forc them to invest huge sum of money to expand their networks, which ha been a boon to Infinera' business.Imag source: Getti Images.That' a wonder backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledov the last few quarter to translat that bandwidth demand growth into financi success. While there are sever factor to blame, one of the biggest problem is competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- ha caught up to Infinera' technolog edg and ha been eat the company' lunch as of late. While Infinera' manag is awar of the problem and is invest heavili to recaptur it edge, it might be a long-haul until the compani return to top-lin growth.Of course, those worri have now beenpric into the company' stock, so investor could be in a posit to win big if the compani can grow faster than market watcher expect.Th better buyWhil I'm hope that Infinera can right it ship, there are never ani guarante of success. For that reason, I think that the better choic for investor today is Skyworks. Not onli doe Skywork promis high growth rate ahead, but it is alreadi so profit that it pay out a fast-grow dividend and still ha enough cash left over tobuy back boatload of stock. As long as the compani can continu to make progress at fix it custom concentr issues, then it futur is look quit bright.10 stock we like better than Skywork SolutionsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Chronological History of How Qualcomm Became the Most Powerful Apple Supplier Ever,1/28/2017,"Imag source: Apple.If you read throughApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) blockbust lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , there' quit a bit of animos toward how Qualcomm conduct it busi with Appl over the years. Thi wa not a pleasant relationship -- at least accord to Apple.makeArticleAd();Instead, thi relationship wa skew significantli in favor of Qualcomm, and there wasn't a whole lot that Appl could do sinc the iPhon fundament reli on cellular connectivity. Thi is easili the onli time that Appl ha not had the upper hand with a supplier relationship. Look no further than Apple' ownnegoti tacticswith now-defunct GT Advanc to see how hard Appl could squeez it suppliers. Yet Qualcomm wa abl to becom the most power Appl supplier ever.Thi stori ha at least a decad of histori that you need to know to fulli appreci whi Appl felt desper enough to sue. ""I'v alway hate litig and I continu to hate it,"" said CEO Tim Cook in 2014, so we know Appl isn't trigger-happi when it come to suing. The Mac maker simpli had enough. Note that what follow is larg Apple' side, as laid out in the complaint. Qualcomm will of cours offer a differ perspective.That be said, let' start from the beginning.2007: Appl introduc the origin iPhoneMuch of Qualcomm' patent portfolio is consid essenti to cellular standard that enabl modern mobil devic to connect to cellular networks, which is the foundat of it licens business. Standards-essenti patent (SEPs) must be licens to anyone, includ competitors, at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatori (FRAND) rates.Appl initi sourc baseband modem from Infineon, which wa subsequ acquir byIntel, for the first four years. Even befor Appl ever bought it first Qualcomm baseband, it had to pay licens fee indirectli through it contract manufacturers. Appl attempt to negoti a direct licens with Qualcomm, but wa unabl to, accord to it complaint:Appl ha been indirectli pay Qualcomm licens fee sinc 2007, when it releas the iPhone....In 2007, Appl releas the first iPhon use Intel (then Infineon) baseband processor chipsets. Qualcomm requir licens fee for use these chipsets. Rather than grant Appl a direct licens on FRAND terms, Qualcomm ha instead enter into confidenti licens with specif Appl contract manufactur (""CMs""), the third-parti manufactur who make and assembl Appl products. The CM pay the exorbit royalti Qualcomm demand and pass the cost along to Appl in full.A a way to get relief on excess royalties, Appl enter into a ""Market Incent Agreement"" with Qualcomm in 2007 that prohibit it from market WiMAX devices, an emerg 4G standard that would compet with LTE -- and which Qualcomm lack meaning patent for. Obviously, if Appl can't market a device, it won't make said device. While thi wa befor Appl becam a major player in the smartphon market, thi agreement certainli contribut to WiMAX' death.It wa around 2007 that Qualcomm allegedli stop licens it SEP to rivals, and began charg separ for licenses. Thi violat thepat exhaust doctrineof patent law.Around 2007, Qualcomm' practic of licens it FRAND-encumb cellular SEP to competitor changed. In 2006, Qualcomm' 10-K state that it enter into ""Licens Agreements"" with compet chipset manufacturers, and receiv royalti thereunder. In Qualcomm' 2007 10-K, the term ""Licens Agreements"" wa replac by ""Agreements."" Qualcomm' 2008 10-K provid that in ""everi case, these agreement do not allow such integr circuit supplier to pass through right under Qualcomm' patent to such suppliers' customers, and such customers' sale of CDMA-bas wireless subscrib devic into which such suppliers' integr circuit are incorpor are subject to the payment of royalti to us in accord with the customers' separ licens arrang with us.""...Sinc at least 2007, Qualcomm ha engag in systematic, continu conduct to exclud competit in the relev chipset markets.2008: Turmoil in the baseband marketIn January,Analog Devicesexit the baseband market by sell it baseband busi to MediaTek for $350 million in cash. MediaTek wa one of the few remain baseband companies.In October, Freescal announc that it wa discontinu all mobil chips, includ basebands, RF transceivers, and more.2009: Joint ventures, negotiations, and regulatori actionsEricssonandSTMicroelectronicsform a joint venture, ST-Ericsson, in order to target the mobil market, includ basebands, among other chips.Know that it want to eventu releas an iPhon that could connect to CDMA networks, Appl start to lay the foundat of procur baseband chipset from Qualcomm in the near future. Incredibly, Appl wa unabl to get Qualcomm to commit to it suppli requirements, a standard ask of prospect suppliers. On the contrary, Qualcomm specif retain the right to withhold chip as leverage.Th 2009 Strateg Term Agreement (""STA"") address the process by which Qualcomm suppli chipset and associ softwar to Apple. It also restrict Apple' abil to sue Qualcomm for patent infring concern Qualcomm chipsets. While Appl gener negoti firm suppli commit with it compon vendors, Qualcomm refus to provid Appl such a commitment, instead arbitrarili cap it liabil for failur to supply, and reserv for itself the abil to termin it oblig to suppli chipset to Apple' CMs. Qualcomm' unilater right to termin suppli of chipset to Apple' CM wa retain in the Amend and Restat Strateg Term Agreement (""ASTA""), effect Februari 28, 2013.Dure thi year, Qualcomm also found itself subject to regulatori investig in both Japan and South Korea over it shenanigans.Th Japan Fair Trade Commiss (""JFTC"") ha been investig Qualcomm sinc 2006. In Septemb 2009, the JFTC conclud that Qualcomm violat the Japanes Antimonopoli Act by forc license to cross-licens their patent on a royalty-fre basi and agre to a non-assert provision, and order the compani to ceas these practices....In Juli 2009, the KFTC levi the largest fine it had ever impos on a compani -- $207 million -- on Qualcomm for abus it domin share of the CDMA chipset market.Not that thi 2009 Korea Fair Trade Commiss (KFTC) fine is separ from anoth one that the KFTC just impos a few week ago.2011: Appl launch the iPhon on Verizon, and Qualcomm' exclus beginsThi wa a big one. In mani ways, thi wa the year that Appl fullygot into bed with Qualcomm, larg becauseVerizon' 3G network use CDMA instead of GSM. As the largest U.S. carrier, it wa an import strateg move for Appl ahead of the schedul end ofAT&Texclusivity. Fulli awar of this, Qualcomm flex it licens muscles:Appl becam even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to Apple' desir to releas an iPhon that could connect to CDMA networks, such as Verizon's....Sinc 2011, when Appl introduc the first CDMA version of it products, Qualcomm ha charg Appl a monopolist premium for access to CDMA chipset that are in all other respect ident to chipset sold to Appl without CDMA function enabled. Qualcomm price it CDMA chipset without regard to competit alternatives.Qualcomm' exclus in supplyingallbaseband chipset began in 2011. Seek relief from excess royalties, Qualcomm gave Appl rebat that were conting upon, among other things, exclusivity. We'r talk about billion of dollars:Specifically, sinc 2011, Qualcomm ha condit billion of dollar in rebat on exclus or de facto exclus from Apple.Thi exclus end just a few month ago, with Intel come on board as a second supplier. The time of thi lawsuit is sure not a coincidence.NVIDIAannounc in May that it is acquir Icera' baseband and RF asset for $367 million, with the hope of both address the baseband market as well as integr cellular connect into it new Tegra line of mobil chips.2012: Bye, TIAfter decid to exit the baseband market four year prior,Texa Instrumentscontinu it plannedexit of the mobil chip market. TI discontinu it OMAP applic processors, and kept ratchet down it baseband business. TI had still been make baseband for a few promin customers, but now plan to wind them down complet by year' end.2013: Anoth agreement, anoth exit, and anoth regulatori investigationAppl kick off 2013 with a new Busi Cooper and Patent Agreement (BCPA) that took effect on the first day of the year. Thi wa simpli an agreement intend in part to provid royalti relief. Thi BCPA also had the provis that Appl could not instig or induc ani regulatori investigations, although Appl wa allow to cooper if approached.In general, the BCPA, effect Januari 1, 2013, provid certain incent to Appl in exchang for specif defin busi cooperation, and provid Qualcomm certain right to Appl s patents. The BCPA expir on Decemb 31, 2016, and is attach hereto as Exhibit A....From 2013 through mid-2016, Appl receiv quarterli rebat from Qualcomm, includ the rebat requir under the BCPA, call BCP Payments.In other words, Appl didn't even wait a full month follow the BCPA' expir to file suit.Ericsson and STMicroelectron decid to dissolv the ST-Ericsson joint venture, with Ericsson take over baseband modem products. It would exit soon.Broadcomagre in Septemb to acquir the 4G LTE asset from Japan-bas Renesa for $164 million.China' Nation Develop and Reform Commiss (NDRC) began it anti-monopoli investig in November.2014: Even more regulatori investigationsBroadcom announc in June that it wouldform exitth baseband market, and would attempt to sell it baseband assets. The compani expect to save $700 million in annual oper expens as a result. CEO Scott McGregor would later say that Broadcom wa lose $2 millionp daybi tri to compet in the baseband market. Of the initi 2,500 estim layoffs, McGregor said 500 employe were abl to find other posit at Broadcom, but 2,000 worker were let go.No wonder compani kept exit the baseband modem market. Imag source: Intel Investor Meet 2014.Both the U.S. Feder Trade Commiss and the European Commiss open their own investigations, commenc in Septemb and October, respectively.Appl attempt yet again to negoti a direct license, know that sever agreement would expir in less than two years. It wa unsuccessful.Discuss date back to at least Novemb 2014 between Appl and Qualcomm about a direct licens for certain patent were conduct with the knowledg that certain of the agreement govern the parties' commerci relationship, such as the TA and BCPA, were set to expir at the end of 2016.Roughli a year and a half after ST-Ericsson' dissolution, Ericsson also bail on basebands, cut 1,000 job in the process.2015: Qualcomm make peac with China, attempt to with AppleIn February, Qualcomm settl with China' NDRC and negoti a rectif plan. The compani paid the $975 million fine in full and agre to modifi it busi practic in the Middl Kingdom. Qualcomm began charg royalti rate of 5% for 3G CDMA and WCDMA devices, includ multimod devic that use both 3G and 4G. 4G devic that do not use CDMA fetch 3.5%. In both cases, that percentag is levi on a royalti base of 65% of the device' net sell price. Qualcomm offer these term to Apple, but Appl reject them, not believ that the offer wa consist with FRAND.Four year after acquir Icera' baseband assets, NVIDIA announc in May that it would wind down it Icera baseband operations, conced defeat to Qualcomm.Marvellannounc a ""signific restructuring"" of it mobil platform, alsobail on mobil chipslik baseband and applic processors. Annual oper expens save were estim at $170 million to $220 million; Marvel laid off 17% of it employees.Th European Commiss sent Qualcomm two formal Statement of Object in Decemb base on it preliminari conclus that ""the compani may have illeg paid a major custom for exclus use it chipset and sold chipset below cost with the aim of forc a competitor out of the market."" Well, now we know who that major custom is, although Appl wasn't name at the time.2016: The end of exclusivityAppl approach Qualcomm onc again in Februari look for a direct license. Dure discussions, Qualcomm disagre on which patent may or may not be in fact essential, and the compani remov a public list of it patent from it website.On Februari 5, 2016, Appl reiter it interest in explor a direct licens to certain patent in Qualcomm' patent portfolio....Appl reject Qualcomm' attempt to shirk it burden to prove the merit of it claims. Qualcomm thereaft remov from it websit it public list of U.S. patent disclos to [European Telecommun Standard Institute] and preclud archiv search of that list. Consist with Qualcomm' other hide-the-bal behavior, thi action make it harder for a license to determin which patent Qualcomm ha declar to be essenti to cellular standards.Qualcomm' exclus as Apple' baseband supplier end in the spring.Th KFTC request inform from Apple, and Appl testifi to the KFTC in August. Less than a month later, Qualcomm retali by withhold the quarterli Q2 rebat payment outlin by the BCPA that Appl had earn as of June 30 but wasn't due to be paid until September. Qualcomm hasn't paid the subsequ two quarterli payments, either. The $1 billion that Appl is seek compris three quarterli payments.2017: Back to the futureThat more or less bring us up to speed with how Qualcomm extract exclus from Apple, which wa a key factor in push out rivals. Appl is by far the largest purchas of stand-alon modems, and miss out on that busi wa utterli fatal for rivals' baseband ambitions. In Apple' words:Thi conduct ha foreclos Qualcomm' competitor from deal with Apple, a key purchas of chipsets, lead to the margin and exit of mani of those competitors, and to the acquisit and mainten by Qualcomm of monopoli power. But-for Qualcomm' conduct as alleg herein, rival chipset manufactur would have becom stronger competitor to Qualcomm.No other Appl supplier in histori ha been abl to wield such power over the Cupertino company. The key differenti wa Qualcomm' massiv patent portfolio, combin with it willing to disregard industri norm as well as it own FRAND licens commitments. Perhap more importantli for Appl go forward, there will probabl never be anoth supplier with thi much power ever again.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar,1/28/2017,"There' a lot to get to thi week in solar, so let' dive right in.Th fast and furiou progress of solar energyIn 2011, then Secretari of the U.S. Depart of Energi Steven Chu launch the SunShot initi with a goal of cut the cost of instal a utility-scal solar system for $1 per watt by 2020. At the time, I call the 74% reduct in the cost of solar in a decad ""an audaci goal.""Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Less than six year later and three year ahead of schedule, I'm here to say that I underestim the solar industry. Project are be built for less than $1 per watt today, and cost reduct continu to amaz even the most bullish observers. Everyth from solar panel to invert to permit cost have come down in the last six year with the SunShot program help with the reductions. And $1 per-watt solar will lead to a whole new surg in demand, which is veri bullish for solar compani around the world.Appl and NV Energi find common groundBerkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) subsidiari NV Energi ha taken it share of lump from the renew energi industri over the last few years. Solar advoc help drive a ballot measur in Novemb that will give custom more choic than buy energi from the monopoly. And casino companies, which are it largest customers, are start tocut their tie to the utilityand buy energi elsewhere.NV Energi may be learn that it can't take such an adversari approach to renew energi and customers' desir to buy renew after agre to help Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) build a 200 MW solar power plant by earli 2019. The util will buy energi from the solar plant and sell the energi to Appl for a data center in Reno, continu Apple' growth in solar adoption.Corpor custom will like be big driver of renew energi in 2017, demand clean energi to power their busi around the country. Mayb util are final learn that it' better to go along with the renewable-energi revolut than fight it and lose their custom to someon else.Don't freak out about the ITC... yetTh solar industri is abuzz with specul about the solar invest tax credit (ITC), which help fund everi solar project in the countri today. The subsidi wa extend at the end of 2015 and is current set to startstep down from 30% in 2019to a perman 10% from commerci projects, and 0% for residenti projects, start in 2022.It' no secret that most of the new Trump Administr is less in favor of renew energi than the past administration, so there' concern the ITC could be in trouble. But comment from Treasuri Secretari nomine Steve Mnuchin in support of wind subsidies, and Secretari of State nomine Rex Tillerson in relat to climat change, have eas some of those tensions.Keep in mind that the ITC stepdown is current law and would requir an act of Congress, includ 60 vote in the Senate, to be repealed. I think that' unlik to happen, especi when you consid the 200,000+ job in solar and extrem popular of the energi source. The ITC seem safe, despit the likelihood that it' unpopular insid the White House. Unless someth changes, solar investor can breath a sigh of relief.New and notesHer are the other notabl item of the week that investor shouldn't lose sight of.Eo Energi Storag andSiemens(NASDAQOTH: SIEGY)announc a partnershipto integrate, install, and servic utility-scal energy-storag solutions. It' hard to state how big it is that a giant in electricity-distribut equip is take a role in energi storage, which will help solar provid more valu to the grid. We don't know exactli what will happen with the partnership in term of cost or demand for utility-scal storage, but the fact that it' on the radar of giant of the industri is big for renew energy.Pattern Energi Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) announc the close of $350 million in senior note due 2024 with a 5.875% interest rate.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business,1/27/2017,"Surfac lineup.

The compani ha had it fair share of misstep for the Surface, but it' safe to say at thi point that Microsoft ha exceed most earli expect for it first-parti devices. Microsoft ha adapt quickli to flop like Surfac RT, which result in a $900 million writedown back in 2013, and push forward with expand the portfolio, most recent with Surfac Studio.makeArticleAd();Surfac revenu dure the fourth quarter came in at $1.3 billion, repres a sequenti increas of over 40% for the busi holiday shop season. That' enough to bring full-year 2016 Surfac revenu to an impress $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar year shown.It also probabl help that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger leader than hi predecessor, even though the Surfac strategi wa conceiv under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surfac hardwar creat a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also contribut to Ballmer' ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDur the earn call, Nadella note that Surfac ha enjoy three consecut quarter of 25%-plu growth. Sale mix is transit toward the newer product like Surfac Pro 4 and Surfac Book, and Surfac 3 sale are expect to continu wind down.Th custom recept for Surfac Studio in particular ha been strong, which is especi impress for two reasons: Surfac Studio wa not wide avail dure the fourth quarter, and it' extrem expensive, start at $3,000. Inventori for the new all-in-on should start improv thi quarter as product ramp up.Tak a bite out of AppleMor broadly, Surfac is but part of a bigger push among the Window PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surfac is do well, but it wa never expect to compris a larg chunk of the Window ecosystem; that' what origin equip manufactur (OEMs) are for.CFO Ami Hood said that Microsoft' ""OEM non-pro perform should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium devic category."" In other words, high-end consumer-ori PC made by Microsoft' partner are gain traction in the market, at a time when Appl lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Appl report fourth-quart result next week). OEM non-pro revenu grew 5% last quarter, outpac the broader PC market.Surfac is profitable, tooIt' also worth point out that Surfac is now profit on a gross margin basi (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so those revenu gain are start to enjoy some oper leverage.Unfortunately, currenc headwind are advers impact profitability, as Surfac gross margin wa up 17% on a constant currenc basi in dollar terms. There' a big discrep between the currenc impact on revenu (2 percentag points) compar to gross margin (11 percentag points), which is due to the fact that Surfac devic are manufactur in Asia and the Surfac cost structur is more vulner to currenc fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for be abl to take a struggl segment conceiv under Ballmer and turn it into a profit $4.3 billion busi within just a coupl of years.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shareholders, however, seem to have a clue about what they might be, and appar feel they will be huge.Appl ha yet to be hurt by ani of this. AAPL stock price is up about 1.7% sinc the court paper were filed. But, the march to it record high of $132.54 per share, achiev in May 2015, may now be disrupted.3 Grossli Overpr Tech Stock That Could CollapseWhat the War Is AboutQualcomm control standard essenti patent (SEPs), includ those for the Code Divis Multipl Access (CDMA) system use by carrier such asVerizon Commun Inc.(NYSE:VZ). Thi mean that everi CDMA phone chip maker, and CDMA base station maker, is pay licens fee to Qualcomm for use those patents. Appl began do so in 2011when it open the iPhon to Verizon' network.Qualcomm use it CDMA patent to becom the sole supplier of modem chip for the iPhone. It like thi posit and refus to join industry-wid agreement cover Fair, Reason and Non-Discriminatori (FRAND) access to it patents, give QCOM the power to constrict Apple' suppli of modem chips.Appl eventu foundanoth supplier for the chips,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), while still pay licens fee to Qualcomm.Qualcomm, meanwhile,won an expens fight with China over it patent rights, and is fight with South Korea after gettingSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to back down and use Qualcomm gear in it phones.Th short version is that Qualcomm use it patent to control the global phone market and Appl doesn't like that.Th Risk to AppleWhil the market ha discount the risk in these fight to Qualcomm, it ha not consid the potenti impact on Apple. Credit the $642 billion market cap of Apple, against Qualcomm' $76 billion.Ther is also a whisper number on Appl earnings, due out Januari 31, of$77.04 billion in revenu and profit of $3.23 per share. Combin that with over $200 billion in cash and the market may be anticip a rais in the Appl dividend, current 57 cent per share. AAPL stock price is still float on Christmas.But, the risk in a patent war are real. Intel had to turn itself inside-out to make those iPhon modem chips. Anoth gener of phone and network is coming, and Qualcomm will have patent to fight with there, too.Appl ha alreadi suffered, the compani claim in court, lose a $1 billion rebat it say Qualcomm owe it after AAPL helpeda South Korean investigationinto Qualcomm' busi practices, one that result in South Korea imposing$864 million in fines.So far, Qualcomm ha won in China and it ha won against Samsung, and Apple' legal argument don't scare it. If Korea can get Qualcomm to pay the fine, Samsung may feel emboldened, but SSNLF isin disarrayand may not be in a posit to fight Qualcomm ani time soon. Appl ha taken up it sword.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steal AI Expert Back From Appl Inc.

There' not a darn thing anyon can do to stop the train. AndFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will have it no other way.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, Facebook is probabl one of the few compani that recogn thi demograph reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a veri real challeng to the near-hegemon domin ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Honestly, the social media network is well on it way to becom whatAppl Inc.

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc.,1/27/2017,"With theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) score a lucki break, win a signific portion of the cellular modem order for Apple' latest handset -- arguabl the highest-profil smartphon win that Intel ha ever enjoyed.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel cellular modem chips, brand the XMM 7360, are found insid version of the iPhon 7 devic use on network that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chip from rivalQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) are found in the iPhon model use on CDMA networks, as Intel' chip current don't implement CDMA.Back in late 2015, Intel purchas the CDMA chipset asset from a compani call VIA Telecom, presum in a bid to allow the former to build chip that could address the entireti of Apple' cellular modem needs.Though Qualcomm is wide believ to build superior modem to what Intel produces, Appl recent file a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that ""Qualcomm ha charg Appl a monopolist premium for access to CDMA chipset that are in all other aspect ident to chipset sold to Appl without CDMA function enabled. ... Qualcomm ha use it monopoli power in CDMA chipset to obtain anticompetit licens and chipset suppli terms,"" the complaint file on Jan. 20 read.I'l be write more on the lawsuit in the come day and today there is an observ I would like to share regard Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.Apple' compon cost could come down if Intel succe in implement CDMABas on thi complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charg Appl more for the same exact cellular modem with CDMA enabl compar to version without CDMA enabled. Thi isn't an unusu practic in the semiconductor industry; compani like Intel routin charg more for ident chip but with certain featur enabled, compar with variant without those featur enabled. Thi is plain old product segment at work.Imag source: Qualcomm.What' interest is that Appl is complain that, becaus Qualcomm essenti ha no viabl competit for it CDMA-en modems, it is charg a ""monopolist premium.""Th magnitud of thi premium isn't clear, but it' clear that Appl isn't happi about have to pay it, and therein lie the opportun for Intel.If Intel can develop a commerci viabl LTE modem that also support CDMA (and is certifi on all of the major CDMA networks) use those VIA Telecom assets, then thi would open the door to a coupl of possibilities:Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true ""second source"" for all the iPhon that Appl ships. Thi could potenti boost Intel' share at Apple, to Intel' benefit (and to Qualcomm' detriment).Appl could be abl to get cheaper CDMA modem from Qualcomm. Even if Appl doesn't increas the proport of total modem that it purchas from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm part would be viabl for all iPhon model could help reduc the averag price that Appl pay per cellular modem.Net-net, Intel' becom a stronger cellular modem provid would mean that Appl should, in general, pay less for modems. Thi could help modestli improv Apple' gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit.To put thi into perspective, in the complaint, Appl say that LTE modem sell for between $10 and $20. Let' suppos that Appl must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chip and then $20 for the CDMA-cap Qualcomm chip -- though with the iPhon 7, Appl doesn't appear to be buy ani non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhon now use Intel.If Appl can get that $20 figur down to $15 in the presenc of a viabl altern from Intel, then that' $5 save across potenti 100 million or more iPhon model sold in a year. That $5 figur is for illustr purpos only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multipli across the volum that Appl sells, the save Appl could potenti realiz are significant.Intel need to executeTh key to all of thi is for Intel to execut to build increasingli competit cellular modems. If Intel can, then that' obvious a posit for Intel, as an opportun to sell more modems, and an opportun for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems.Th loser, if Intel can suppli more of Apple' volum -- whether or not it actual doe -- would be Qualcomm, as at the veri least it could see the premium that it enjoy from the sale of CDMA-cap LTE modem evaporate.In the scheme of things, though, lose a bit more Appl chip busi probabl isn't go to sting Qualcommthatmuch. After all, Intel grab a bunch of iPhon share thi cycle, yet Qualcomm' chip busi appear to be on theright track.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit?,1/26/2017,"Share ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) plung 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmak wa su for $1 billion by one of it biggest customers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is relat to the FTC' separatelawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleg that the chipmak leverag it portfolio of critic wireless patent to forc it baseband competitor out of the market. Let' take a closer look at thi tangl mess, and see if Qualcomm sharehold should sell their shares.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Whi is Appl su Qualcomm?Back in 2008,Sprintdeploy it first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't heavili depend on Qualcomm' patent portfolio.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) champion the use of WiMax chips, but Qualcomm oppos WiMax in favor of it upcom LTE standard -- which it could gener more licens fee from.At the time, Appl consid launch an iPhon for WiMax networks. Realiz that the move could hurt it LTE ambitions, Qualcomm agre to pay Appl ""rebates"" for stick with it baseband modem and wait for it LTE standard instead. Those rebat payment were depend on Appl do two thing --exclusivelyus Qualcomm' chip (from 2011 to 2016), and notinstigatingani litig which accus the chipmak of unfair licens practices. The FTC claim that Qualcomm essenti ""bribed"" Appl with those rebat to prevent it from switch to compet chipsets.Ov the past two years, Qualcomm wa hit with antitrust probe worldwide, which all alleg that it charg unfair licens fee for it 3G/4G technologies. It wa fine $975 million in China, anoth $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in addit fine in Europ and Taiwan. Appl claim that becaus it cooper with author in Korea dure the investigation, Qualcomm retali by withhold $1 billion in rebat payment -- which it' now su to recover.Th outcom is anyone' guess...Th battl between Qualcomm and Appl will be a long and nasti one, sinc it' depend on mani shift variables. First, the FTC lawsuit could be drop if commission Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican who vote against charg Qualcomm that wa just appoint the act chairwoman by the Trump Administration, choos not to follow through. If the case is dropped, the rebat should remain a valid busi arrangement; but if it isn't, the rebat could be invalid as ""bribes"" -- which may hurt both companies.Regardless of what happen with the FTC case, Appl need to prove that it didn't violat the two main condit of it rebat agreement by use Intel modem or aid the Korean FTC dure it investigation. Appl doesn't deni aid the KFTC at all -- it recent told CNN that it wa mere ""respond truth to law enforc agencies"" instead of ""instigating"" litig against Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justifi mani of it opaqu licens practices. Qualcomm charg royalti base on a device' entir value, instead of just the chip in the devic -- a practic that wa alreadi block by Chines regulators. It also charg licens fee on 3G/4G handset which don't use ani of it chips, sinc those devic still reli on it wireless technolog -- although Appl argu that some of Qualcomm' licens patent don't actual cover those core technologies. Thi mean that Appl still pay Qualcomm fee on iPhon use Intel modem (and also the Infineon modem it use in the past), and that those fee are like higher due to the lack of rebates.Understand the risk to QualcommIf Qualcomm lose it case against Appl and other regulators, it could be forc to chang it entir licens model. That move would caus the QTL (licensing) business' margin to wither and crush it earn sinc the busi gener the lion' share of it profits.It could also jeopard Qualcomm'splan acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automot chipmak in the world while expand it patent portfolio. If Qualcomm doesn't close that deal thi year, it top line will remain heavili expos to the commodit of the smartphon market and seemingli endless challeng against it licens business.But should you sell Qualcomm?Qualcomm face plenti of legal headwinds, but I believ that the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that ha knock the stock down to irrat levels. Qualcomm now trade at 14 time earnings, as oppos to the industri averag of 22. It also pay a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easili support by a payout ratio of 53%.A a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainli disappoint with recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my share unless the litig either derail the NXP deal or forc Qualcomm to dramat reduc it licens fees. Until then, I'll still consid Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with solid growth prospect inadjac marketslik connect cars, drones, and Internet of Thing gadgets.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm's Earnings Call Dominated By Apple Lawsuit,1/26/2017,"CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Imag source: Qualcomm.Mobil chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) report fiscal first-quart result last night. While the result as well as guidanc mostli top analyst expectations,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent lawsuit against the compani expectedli domin the subsequ earn call (""Apple"" wa mention 74 times). For good reason, too, sinc Appl is wide consid Qualcomm' largest customer, combin with the fact that the lawsuit threaten Qualcomm' licens model.makeArticleAd();Beyond a few brief statements, thi is the first time that Qualcomm ha comment publicli and in granular detail regard the suit. Here' what manag had to say.Prepar remarksCEO Steve Mollenkopf first note that the two compani have histor had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intend to ""remain a good supplier"" despit the legal complaint. The compani would natur have prefer to settl it disput with Appl in privat negoti instead of litigation, but it remain confid that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf sum it up: ""Apple' complaint contain a lot of assertions, but in the end, thi is a commerci disput over the price of intellectu property. They want to pay less for the fair valu that Qualcomm ha establish in the marketplac for our technology, even though Appl ha gener billion in profit from use that technology.""Presid Derek Aberl continued:Touch briefli on Apple' complaint file in San Diego and China, it claim that Qualcomm should be requir to licens it cellular standard essenti patents, or SEPs, to modem suppliers. That even when licens those patent at the devic level, Qualcomm should onli be abl to charg royalti on the price of the cellular modem chip insid the device.Thes positions, however, are inconsist with long-stand industri practice, the [intellectu properti rights] polici of the relev standard-set bodies, the realiti of licens larg portfolio of patents, and basic notion of efficiency, fair in economics.Aberl point out that device-level licens is util throughout the industri by mani major patent holder beyond Qualcomm. (Appl is seek chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm say it patent also contribut to mani other featur in modern smartphon beyond cellular connectivity, further justifi device-level royalties. Shift to chip-level royalti would then introduc differ layer of licens for all the variou chip that Qualcomm enabl or sell itself, so it licens the entir portfolio for the sake of efficiency.Appl say that there is no limit to the royalti rates, which is whi it seek per-unit royalti relief in the form of ""rebate"" payments. Aberl say thi is untrue:In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm ha per-unit run royalti cap as part of it licens program. Thi effect result in license not pay run royalti as a percentag of the devic price abov a certain net sell price of ani given device. Apple' claim that royalti are uncap is simpli incorrect.Aberl also reiter that Qualcomm believ Appl is instig these regulatori attack as well as provid inaccur information:Appl claim that Qualcomm retali becaus Appl cooper with govern investigations. To be clear, we did no such thing. We simpli object to Appl make fals and mislead statement and withhold inform to motiv attack against Qualcomm. We welcom the opportun to have Apple' claim heard in court, where we will be entitl to full discoveri of Apple' practic and a robust examin of the merits. We will prove that Apple' irrespons claim of extort are false.Ther should be no immedi impact to sale from the lawsuit, either. Appl still need modems, and Qualcomm will still suppli them. CFO Georg Davi said, ""We are not forecast ani impact to revenu relat to the disput with Apple, as we are continu to meet their suppli need in good faith and expect Appl will continu to meet it obligations.""Quest and answersA usual, the analyst Q&A often provid more color. Qualcomm affirm that Appl doe not have a direct license, but rather an indirect licens through it contract manufacturers. Qualcomm isn't worri about collecting, said Aberle:Appl doe not have a direct licens with Qualcomm today. And so the royalti on Appl product that get paid to Qualcomm are report and paid by their contract manufacturers. So although we do have a disput now with Appl and they are challeng some of the offer and some of our licens terms, the contract that we have in place with their supplier remain valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our license will continu to compli with the term of their agreements. And we would also hope and expect that Appl would not interfer with the term of those agreements. But of course, we can't fulli control those actions.When ask about the exclus and monopoli power allegations, gener counsel Don Rosenberg (who incident use to work for Appl a decad ago), downplay the idea that Qualcomm wield monopoli power:With regard to your question about so-cal exclus deal, first of all, we -- I think you call thi monopoli power or had monopoli power. We don't believ we have monopoli power in the chip market or ani other market. And nor do we have an exclus arrangement. We have never prevent Appl or anybodi els from buy from competit chipmakers. And in the Appl case, it' pretti clear since, as you know, they have been buy fromIntelfairli recently. So it' a mischaracter to call it an exclus deal arrangement.Thi is a littl murky, sinc Applehadbeen exclus buy baseband from Qualcomm for five years, and onli start buy from Intel after the alleg exclus ended.Overall, Qualcomm think Appl is simpli tri to finagl lower payment -- lower be beneath fair valu as establish by it hundr of other licens deal with mani compani over the years. That risk somewhat oversimplifi Apple' complaint, becaus Appl is also accus Qualcomm of variou form of anticompetit behavior. Whether or not those alleg stand up in court remain to be seen.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

DTEK70' develop cost are all shoulder by it partner. BlackBerri get a cut in the sale through the softwar licensing. High profit margin from softwar sale will translat to more profit for the company.Th one big catch is that BBRi and TCL must advertis and promot thi upcom device.

"Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",1/26/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it' been an unpleas 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock final reach a new all-tim high last month. Despit the tech world chang drastic in the ensu years, Microsoft' PC domin live on, mint money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart Via FlickrTh company' variou new effort over the year have mostli been flops. There' a reason Microsoft stock ha perform poorly; effort such as Window phone simpli haven't pan out. However, it seem Microsoft ha final turn the corner.It is make real headway in sever promis areas, includ it cloud offering. And investor have cheered, send Microsoft' stock up sharpli sinc 2013. Can the good time continue, or will buyer up at these level be in for anoth long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHug Stock Run-Up: Sinc 2013, MSFT stock ha more than doubled. At first glance, that seem fine, the market ha perform strongli in recent year after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becom hard to achiev further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more doubl take Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It' worth ask what the compani ha go from a growth perspect that could justifi such a lofti figure.Sure, the compani ha some growth initi under way. The cloud offer is go well. And the LinkedIn acquisit may start to bear more fruit. But after watch the stock run from under 30 in recent year to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upsid realli make sense, particularli sinc the compani ha had near non-exist revenu growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First thing first, MSFT stock isn't realli trade at a 30 price-earn ratio. I know that' what financi websit report. However, that' base on GAAP figur that includ one-off loss relat to restructuring. On an adjust basis, Microsoft is trade in the mid-20s, and at 21 time forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flatter pictur for the company. Microsoft trade at 12 time earn or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth pay twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market ha stabilized, but it isn't like to ever be a meaning growth driver again. And the newer initi such as cloud seem like to take year to reach strong profitability. At 21 time forward earnings, MSFT stock is price in some seriou growth prospect that may well not materialize.Question Deal-Making:Microsoft ha a reput for make some head-scratch M&A moves. The less said of the aQuant purchas and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alon result in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal rais questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offer a massiv premium to where share where trade previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offer around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earn basis, LinkedIn wa still lose money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some cost there, particularli for stock-bas compensation, but it' still a massiv price tag. And with Microsoft have such a huge war chest on it balanc sheet, the temptat will sure be there for the compani to make other huge value-destruct deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quit a few year now, the tradit PC market appear to be in seriou decline. Sale peak in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Sinc then, sale have plunged. By 2015, sale drop 24% from that peak year, fall to just 275 million units. And 2016 show anoth solid decline, with sale reach just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 project are for 250 million unit sold, onli a fraction declin from current levels.And themost recent datasupport thi further moderation: sale slip just 1.5% versu the same period last year. And in sever area globally, includ Canada and Japan, PC sale are actual increas again. One possibl reason, the rate of forward technolog progress ha slow for both tablet and smartphones, reduc pressur on consum to switch to smaller screens. A stabl market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft ha partner withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Thing efforts. Qualcomm ha enter conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use it chip to even forc attack Intel' long-held domin in the PC market. In ani case, Microsoft benefit nice from partner up with Qualcomm.Th IoT offer born from thi ventur will help spread Window 10 outsid of just the tradit PC market. And given the shellack that QCOM stock took earlier thi week followingAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm ha reason to deepen tie with friendli partners. As an industri outcast, Qualcomm need whatev help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Window as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft ha quietli turn into a nice yield choic for more conserv investors. The compani ha tripl it dividend sinc 2008. In total, it' post 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rate over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio current look a littl high, that' base on abnorm soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenti of room left here for more dividend increases. The compani ha an astound $137 billion in cash on it balanc sheet. Even after subtract out debt, the compani ha a net cash posit of $62 billion, leav plenti of firepow for increas dividends, share buyback or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent select if you'r pure concern with it yield and safety. The company' main PC busi is look healthier than it ha in quit awhile. The balanc sheet is tremendous. The dividend is signific at today' level, and is bound to keep rise quickly.Here' Whi Chevron Corpor (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there' littl to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft ha plenti of growth initi in the works, but actual oper result recent have onli been so-so. When buy stock at all-tim highs, you want to see a busi with more oper momentum.At the time of thi writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no posit in Microsoft.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announc thatHugo Barra will be join FB to lead VR efforts, includ Oculus. If the name sound familiar it should. Barra is veri well known in the technolog industry.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookSo who is Hugo Barra? He wa in the news just last week when it wa reveal he wa leav Chines consum technolog giantXiaomi.H wa hire in 2013 to lead that company' effort to polish it imag in western market and help push it product into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he wa return to hi Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.What Doe Hugo Barra Bring to FB?Prior to Xiaomi, he serv asAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl vice presid of Android product management.In hi announc of Barra' hire, Zuckerberg wrote:""I'm excit that Hugo Barra is join Facebook to lead all of our virtual realiti efforts, includ our Oculu team. Hugo' in China right now, so here we are togeth in VR. It seem fitting.I'v known Hugo for a long time, start when he help develop the Android oper system, to the last few year he' work at Xiaomi in Beij bring innov devic to million of people. Hugo share my belief that virtual and augment realiti will be the next major comput platform.""FB' Oculu ChallengesWhen Facebook bought Oculu for $2 billion in 2014, the prospect for it new virtual realiti divis seem limitless. But for the last six months, the divis ha been struggling.10 Stock to Buy to Surviv a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Founder Palmer Luckey wa bring inbad press over hi polit views, complaint over the highpric for it Oculu Rift headsetand the new Touch Control continued, andSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) unexpectedli began to gain traction with both consum and game develop with it much more afford Playstat VR. In December, Oculu CEO Brendan Irib step down. Now, FB and Luckey areti up in a lawsuitclaim the Oculu founder stole trade secret and violat copyright in order to develop hi Oculu Rift VR headset.On top of all this, the hype over virtual realiti is begin to fade. After be a major part of past Consum Electron shows, there wa a feel thatVR wasn't particularli compel at CE 2017.In short, it' understand whi FB want to kickstart Oculus. An industri veteran like Hugo Barra -someon who is experienc in lead a critic divis in a technolog giant and skill at promot - may well be the answer.Kickstart OculusWhen Barra take over at Oculus, there are a few immedi challeng to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyer will be abl to manag most of that.Th bigger issu in term of get consum to buy into the Oculu rift is pricing. The Oculu Rift alreadi ha mindshar as the VR headset peopl think of. But where the Oculu Rift wa onc pretti much the onli game in town, everi major consum technolog compani - exceptAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - is offer virtual realiti gear, and it' almost alway cheaper.Appl Inc. New iPad Might Be Late to the Parti (AAPL)That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were look at $100 versu $75. But an Oculu Rift plu Touch Control goe for $798. Then you need a reason power PC (mani comput owner would have to upgrade), which is at least anoth $1,000. In comparison, a complet Soni Playstat VR system (includ the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstat VR headset is compat with the origin PS4 - which mani gamer alreadi own, so that bring their invest to just $500.Larg as a result of those cost differences, it'sestim Soni will have sold over 745,000 Playstat VR system in 2016, while project are for the Oculu Rift to hit just 355,000.The hire of Hugo Barra set the stage for FB to aggress promot the technic superior of it Oculu virtual realiti technolog over that use by competitor like Sony. It' also a good move in promot develop relat in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compel VR content. And if he can find some wiggl room to get Oculu Rift price down a bit, Barra stand a good chanc of turn thing around for Facebook' virtual realiti divis in 2017.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Thing Appl Inc.

I did choos AVGO on Decemb 22 when it wa trade around $180. Here' how I describ thi powerhous technolog compani in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is gener classifi as a semiconductor design and developer, it solut serv telecom and enterpris network custom in the build-out of data center and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surpris if they weren't.Thu about half of Broadcom' sale come from the Wire Infrastructur segment which ha been see steadi double-digit growth as these big custom transit to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approxim 30% of Broadcom' revenu come from it Wireless Commun divis which serv top-end mobil smart-devic maker likeAppl (AAPL)with radio frequenc (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technolog filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoust Resonator) filter are a form of bulk acoust wave (BAW) filter that have superior perform with steeper reject curv compar to surfac acoust wave (SAW) filters.Th third major segment at Broadcom is Enterpris Storage, which connect back with mani custom from the Wire divis and suppli just under 20% of revenues. The company' product enabl the high-spe movement of digit data with a secur connect among multipl PCs, server and storag devic such as hard disk drive and solid state drives.Whil AVGO' Wireless busi is ""dependent"" on Apple, that' not exactli a bad problem to have. The come next wave of 5G technolog will keep both compani roll in sale growth.And Broadcom' largest business, the Wire segment, is veri busi meet the demand of compani build high-speed, broadband networks, especi with the data-hog load of video and the storag requir of the Internet of Things.I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?So what ha chang in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simpli this: the stock took off over 10% to new high in the past six session as a coupl of analyst bolster their view of thi must-own tech ""arm dealer."" While I'v been follow fund manag into AVGO for nearli 3 years, the growth stori is not over.On Januari 18, RBC Capit analyst Amit Daryanani reiter hi Top Pick rate on AVGO share and rais hi view of the company' long term earn potenti to $17 EP on the heel of the acquisit of Brocad (BRCD). Here' what he had to say...""Our analysi suggest the underli EP power of AVGO increas materi post BRCD (especi assum they rais $1.5-2.0B from network & real estat sales). We think AVGO could achiev >$17.00 of EP by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upsid scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not rais hi exist price target from $200.So we'll leav that to a bolder fan of the company...On Januari 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback rais hi price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obvious reiter hi Overweight rating. Here' the MS view...""Increas our PT to $240 from $210 and highlight a bull case valuat of $300. Our PT is base on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, repres a turn increas from the current multipl but still a conserv 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peer and 15% below the market. AVGO' multipl ha been flat (100% of stock appreci ha been driven by growth in EPS) compar to a roughli 2x turn increas in semiconductor stocks, with investor unwil to pay up for acquir growth.""However, we now have increas convict that clearer focu on it outperform core business, materi higher cash return and ongo margin expans will drive a re-rat over the next 6-12 months.""Th combin of Avago and Broadcom is unmatch in Network (40% sales) in our view, which ha posit implic for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the compani remain well posit in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leverag it leadership in premium filter and multiplexers.""Th AVGO CampaignAnd there you have an updat on the continu saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign.""

Despit the bottom-lin miss, it’ tough to ignor the potenti valu QCOM stock presents.Indeed, Qualcomm is face some battles. Still, I would place a bet here on QCOM shares, which are price at just 12 time fiscal 2017 estim of $4.74 per share. Trade in the after-hour session at around $55, QCOM stock should reach $62 to $65 in the next 12 to 18 month deliv 18% returns. And the gain could go higher assum it legal battl with Appl (AAPL) get resolved, as I expect it will.Th company’ guidance, for instance, underscor the extent to which the manag remain focu on execution. For the second quarter, Qualcomm is forecast adjust earn per share to be in a rang of $1.15 to $1.25. Thi compar favor toThomson Reuter forecast of about $1.20 a share. Thi make Qualcomm — from a valuat perspect — easi to like at current levels. I’ll get back to that in a moment. Let’ go through he numbers.makeArticleAd();Forth quarter that end December, the San Diego-bas compani report a net incom of $700 million, or 46 cent a share, down from $1.5 billion, or 99 cent a share, a year earlier. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, the compani would have earn $1.19 a share, which beat analyst estim by a penny.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview,1/25/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock ha had an impress run over the past few years. Head into Thursday' fiscal second quarter earn report, MSFT stock is right near an all-tim high, have increas about 150% over the past few years.Source:Via MicrosoftWhat' interest about the gain for such a larg stock - MSFT is the third-most valuabl compani on U.S. markets, behind onlyAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - is that they haven't been base on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft' EP wa $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Rather, the multipl investor assign to MSFT stock ha expanded. It ha more than doubled, in fact.That multipl expans ha come from increas confid toward Microsoft'sfutureearn potential, most notabl in mobil and cloud. Where investor four to five year ago saw a fade giant whose earn were like to decline, Microsoft now look like a sleep giant. And investor clearli believ the company' self-describ ""mobil first, cloud first"" strategi is go to push Microsoft earn up - at some point.It' in that context that the market will analyz the Microsoft earn report due on Thursday.Microsoft' Growth Isn't There…YetIt' alway danger for an investor to believ that the number don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the number realli aren't the most import thing right now.10 Stock to Buy to Surviv a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Analyst consensu - inform in larg part by Microsoft earn guidanc - doesn't predict a particularli impress second quarter earn report. The Street expect EP to rise just a penni year-over-year, which given share repurchases, impli that Microsoft' total net profit actual will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago. Revenu is estim to fall almost 2% year-over-year.Microsoft' guidanc project growth in it Product & Busi and Intellig Cloud segments, but a sharp declin in More Person Computing.That shouldn't be surprising. Offic 365 growth ha help busi revenue, and the Azur platform continu to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Servic in cloud. It' the potenti for success in those product that ha offset fear about continu pressur on revenu from Windows, as PC sale declin and mobil usag increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 ha come mostli from the transition.Th fear of Window loss that led MSFT stock to be valu around 10x EP in 2013 have turn to optim toward growth in Azure, Offic 365, Enterpris Mobil and other areas. That optim ha push the same stock to be valu at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seem unlik that investor will focu on the major headlin number come out of the Microsoft earn report. A beat or miss of a penni or two on earn like isn't go to drive the market' reaction to the report - particularli if that weak come from Windows. Rather, the focu is go to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notabl Azure.There' a reason Microsoft ha steadili expand it disclosur around Azur and cloud growth: That' where investor attent ha been. And it seem like that' where investor attent will stay come out of the Q2 Microsoft earn report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestor seem like to have some patienc with a modest miss in the Microsoft earn report, as expect remain rel low. The compani still is get out from under it deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoff thi year should provid a boost to margin over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expect growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sale are project to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seem to be import in the Q2 Microsoft earn report is whether the base of that growth is intact.Whil Azur is estim to gener just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, it growth rate certainli will be watch closely. After a 140% increas in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, ani slowdown seem like to hurt the stock. But anoth 100%-plu figur would give further evid that Azur is a worthi competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.Th cloud busi as a whole - includ Offic 365 and Dynamics, which is tri to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be anoth area of post-earn analysis.Here' Whi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75What doe that mean for Microsoft stock come out of the Microsoft earn report?Overall, it mean that the quarter seem like to be judg more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobil still aren't the major of MSFT revenu or earnings, they are the cornerston of the Microsoft strategi go forward. And for now, it' rel clear that the market is content to wait for those sale and profit - as long as it continu to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliv anoth earn report that show growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock like will rise - even if the headlin number aren't perfect. But if there' ani sort of stumbl in either cloud or mobile, that investor patienc could revers - quickly.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stock to Build Your Portfolio AroundMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Is Build an AI MonsterTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Q2 Earn Previewappear first onInvestorPlace."

In both cases, the team who help launch the product did not anticip they would revolution an industry.""When we design SPY, we had no idea how flexibl the ETF vehicl would turn out to be,"" Jim Ross, chairman of the global SPDR busi at State Street Global Advisors, said Tuesday at the 10th annual Insid ETF confer in Hollywood, Fla. ""We could not have imagin all the innov way ETF are be use today.""Ross, who wa part of the team that launch SPi 24 year ago, made that point as he drew a parallel between the iPhone' impact on the technolog industri and ETFs' transform of the invest landscape.makeArticleAd();A U.S. ETF enter their 25th year, the ETF industri is cheer both the fact that thi invest vehicl hold a total of more than $2 trillion in asset and that ETF repres less than 5% of the invest market - meaning, there' still plenti of room to grow.ETF certainli continu to be on a hot growth streak. ""ETF asset have roughli doubl everi three year over the past decade,"" Ross said at a confer session titl ""The ETF Revolut And What' Next For ETFs."" He said that there is no reason whi global ETF asset cannot cross $16 trillion by 2025 at the continu annual growth rate of 19%.Drive demand for, and innov use of, ETF are a host of insur companies, ETF strategists, sovereign wealth funds, wealth manag firm and even mutual funds, he added.But Ross also point out that risk tie toETF investinginclud a persist lack of understand about these invest vehicles. In hi afternoon address, he sought to debunk common myth about ETF and offer some tip for trade ETFs.Myth 1:""ETF liquid (issues) could blow up the fixed-incom market."" Despit thi common perception, ETF compris less than 1% of the total fixed-incom market, Ross said. That make it unlik they will ""blow up"" an entir market.In fact, Ross believ fixed-incom ETF can be more effici than other fixed-incom products, as asset in them have continu to increas to more than $400 billion today. And although the underli fixed-incom market can be opaque, fixed-incom ETF offer transpar in term of trade cost and portfolio holdings, he added.Myth 2:""ETF gone wild.""

Even a crude construct ETF, he added, display the American valu of ""take an idea to market and test it out.""Th lesson here, Ross said, is that ""all ETF investor need to understand what they are buying, when they are buying.""Myth 3:""ETF fail to track intrins valu in volatil markets."" Accord to Ross, ETF have in some case help the process of price discoveri in challeng markets.""That happen on Aug. 24 (2015),"" he said. ""SPi trade effici throughout the day"" despit the extrem volatil inth stock marketthat day.Ross noted, too, that follow that day' tradingdisrupt in some stock and ETFs, an ETF industri coalit took action to harmon exchang rule to address the issue.Th lesson here, Ross added, is to understand ETF trade basics:1.
