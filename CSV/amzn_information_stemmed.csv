We ask three Motley Fool contributor to look into the tech sector to pick out three of their favorit that can continu have a huge, posit impact on your portfolio over time. See if you don't agre thatTwilio(NYSE: TWLO) ,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , and what some might consid a dark-hors candidate,Fitbit(NYSE: FIT) , still have a lot to offer.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Thi winner will keep winningStev Symington(Twilio): Twilio alreadi boast an enviabl leadership posit in it niche. The cloud-bas commun platform compani ad over 2,000 new activ custom account last quarter alon -- bring it total custom at the end of last year to 36,606 -- includ new effort with compani such asCapit One,Atlassian, UK-bas Paymentsense, and Blue Cross Blue Shield. And that' not to mention that it serv industri juggernaut includ Uber,Netflix,Facebook,andAmazon.com.A a result, Twilio saw revenu rocket 60% year over year last quarter, to $82 million, while it GAAP net loss per share narrow significantli to $0.15 from a net loss of $0.48 per share in the same year-ago period. (The compani broke even on an adjust basis, which exclud item such as stock-bas compensation.) Twilio is, after all, primarili invest in it busi right now to drive innov and take as much market share as possible.That doesn't mean Twilio isn't suscept to disruption. Last month, for example, one analyst note that ride-shar specialistLyft is consideringVonage' compet Nexmo platform as an alternative. But consid Twilio' enviabl growth to date, it' par for the cours to see late-com tri to grab a piec of pie in these earli stage of growth.In the end, though, Twilio stock ha nearli doubl sinc it initi public offer at $15 per share last year, I think it' a winner that should keep on winning. And I'm convinc Twilio still offer upsid for patient, long-term investor will to step in now and watch it growth stori continu to unfold.Imag source: Apple.A supercycl of potentialRich Duprey(Apple):Samsunghad a lot ride on the line when it launch it new Galaxi S8 smartphone, and while it deliv a new sleek, innov device, it wa no iPhon killer. There wa no real ""wow"" factor with it, just a few increment advancements, which mean Apple' own new smartphon iter later thi year will be the real tech development.And it' quit possibl Appl is go to enjoy some huge number when the next iPhon hits. After a lacklust perform with upgrad over the past two years, some analyst think Appl could have a monster on it hand as iPhon 6 user look to upgrad their devices, lead the compani into a ""supercycle.""JPMorgan Chaseanalyst think the market underappreci the sale Appl can generate, but ""it depend on Appl deliv a good product."" They'r confid that is coming.What they'r not feel so bullish about is Appl Services, the segment that gener the best growth of ani for the tech giant. Servic ha becom Apple' second-largest segment behind iPhones, gener more than $24 billion in sale last year. Revenu from the divis surg 18% in the first quarter versu 5% growth from iPhones, but admittedli it' start from a much smaller base. iPhon gener $54 billion in sale in the first quarter; servic just $7 billion.JPMorgan' analyst think that busi is just a lot more challeng than ani other part of Apple, and though it ha some smart peopl work on it, they haven't shown they'r capabl just yet of capit on the potential. But the potenti is still there, so it could be a big winner in the year to come.Ther may come a day when Appl is as well known for the servic it sell to the user of it product as it is for the gadget it sells, but right now Apple' fortun rise and fall on the iPhone, and although it stock ha alreadi gain 25% so far in 2017, the return may have their own supercycl in the near future.Imag source:Fitbit.A tech stock left for deadTim Green(Fitbit): To say that fitness-wear compani Fitbit is go through a rough patch would be an understatement. Sale tumbl dure the crucial holiday season despit a slate of new products, with the compani vastli overestim demand. Layoff and some execut shuffl followed, but the hole Fitbit ha dug for itself is deep. The compani expect revenu to drop by as much as 30% in 2017, and both non-GAAP net incom and free cash flow are expect to turn negative.Th stock ha plummeted, not surprisingly. Share of Fitbit are now down nearli 90% from their all-tim high set in 2015, and they'r down about 56% over the past year. The market valu Fitbit at just $1.3 billion, less than it expect sale in 2017. Fitbit stock deserv much of the pound it ha received, but a valu case can still be made.Fitbit' balanc sheet contain $700 million of cash and no debt, mean that the market is realli onli valu Fitbit' busi at about $600 million. Now, Fitbit doe expect to lose as much as $100 million thi year on a free cash flow basis, so thi cash balanc will like decline. But the market is extrem pessimist on Fitbit' prospect nonetheless. It won't take a roar comeback for the stock to soar, onli someth modestli better than the worst-cas scenario. Fitbit stock is risky, as thing could just keep get worse.

Can Amazon (AMZN) Dethrone Google, Facebook in Advertising Market?;4/5/2017;"Amazon (Shutterstock photo)Th long-stand duopoli that exist between Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiari Googl and Facebook (FB) in the realm of onlin video advertis may soon becom anoligopoly. And, for both incumbents, which togethercontrol 85% of onlin ad dollars, an oligopoli might be their best-cas scenario when consid Amazon (AMZN) may enter the mix.CEO Jeff Bezo doesn’t play to lose.makeArticleAd();Amazon’ advertis busi could surg 65% year over year, reach $3.5 billion in 2017, accord to BMO Capit Market analyst Daniel Salmon, who believ Amazon’ ad prowess may grow into a $150 billion business. Indeed, that’ way away from $3.5 billion, which current trail Google’ $52.9 billion (search and ad revenue) and Facebook’ $27 billion in 2016. How much traction can Amazon gain?""A key point of differenti for Amazon [from competitors] is the massiv amount of consum purchas data it possesses,"" Salmon said in hi note Tuesday. ""While Googl know what peopl are search for and Facebook know what peopl are interest in and who they are connect to, Amazon know the specif product that custom are purchas and how frequent they are purchas these products.”That argument is tough to dispute. Be the domin forc in e-commerc certainli give Amazon an advantag neither Googl nor Facebook can duplicate. But don’t expect Googl or Facebook to just roll over, either. Accord to research firm eMarketer, Googl may rake inmor than $42 billionin mobil internet ad revenu in 2017 and $48.05 billion in 2018, while Facebook is expect to gobbl up about $30 billion in ad revenu in 2017 and $38 billion in 2018.In term of total U.S. search ad revenu thi year, eMarket expect Googl to claim almost 80%, while Facebook will take up about 40% of the display ad market. And when factor the advertis potenti of Snap (SNAP) — parent of popular messag app Snapchat — Amazon’ ad growth will need to acceler to meet Salmon’ projections.Nevertheless, Salmon had enough convict in hi thesi to boost Amazon’ price target to $1,200, while downgrad Alphabet to Market Perform. On the news, investor rush to gobbl up more AMZN shares. AMZN stock close Tuesday at $906.83, reach yet anoth all-tim high — the fifth straight session in which it ha done so. And as with Salmon, I remain an Amazon bull. The company’ ad busi — despit it potenti — is just ice on the cake."

Let' take a look.Scal Back, or Repealing, Dodd-FrankW were look forward to the scale back, or repeal, of the Dodd-Frank Act and believ it would boost ZION' revenue-gener potenti by enabl the bank to trade more freeli and issu more loan by creat collater debt oblig (CDOs) contain trust prefer secur (TrPS). We also anticip a reduct in expens for the bank as complianc cost fell.Th 5 Best Stock to Buy for AprilUnfortunately, not much ha happen on thi front. In fact, Treasuri Secretari Steven Mnuchin ha even express some support for the Volcker Rule - the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit financi institut from engag in proprietari trading.It' still early, but with all of the other legisl prioriti stack up in front of financi regulatori reform, we aren't as confid thi issu is go to be address in the near term.Boost Inflat ExpectationsWe, along with most others, expect Presid Trump' econom polici to boost inflat here in the Unit States. Analyst were anticip increas econom growth, coupl with the potenti for trade battl and the implement of tariffs, would boost inflation. As a result, bond yield would be push higher to compens bond investor for the increas inflat risk they would be facing. This, in turn, would lead to a steeper yield curve, which would be a boon for banks.Unfortunately, the ""reflation"" trade that domin the market through the end of Februari ha faded, and the yield curv is flatten onc again. Thi is a neg for bank and their net interest margin levels.Relax Environment Regul while OPEC Cap ProductionPresid Trump made good on hi promis to relax environment regul for energi producers, includ open up previous unavail area for oil exploration, when he sign hi ""energi independence"" execut order on March 28. Thi should benefit oil produc here in the Unit States, some of whom have taken out loan from ZION.Thi should help the compani revers the rise tide of have to increas it loan loss provis to compens for the number of charge-off in the energi sector.Low Corpor TaxesWith the failur of the Congress to repeal and replac the Afford Care Act (ACA) with the American Health Care Act (AHCA), mani are wonder if the Trump administr is go to be abl to do what it take to reform the U.S. tax code and lower corpor taxes.ZION stock ha shown in the past that it is more than will to send cash back to sharehold in the form of increas dividend and share buyback programs. But if tax reform fail to materialize, the compani won't have ani save to pass on to shareholders.Conclus for ZION StockWeekli Chart of Zion Bancorp (ZION)Each of the four fundament factor we'v discuss abov ha to potenti to lift Zion Bancorp to new multiyear high on it own, but our confid in them all come togeth to push ZION higher ha drop somewhat.Th Best Way to Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) at All-Tim HighsZION hasn't realli move anywher sinc we first look at thi stock at the begin of the year.

In fact, don't spend a penni on Amazon stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen in an overbought situation, put a credit put spread to work and name the price you'd like to pay for a discount on today' prices. Let me explain.A consumers, we are all awar that Amazon sell in a veri big way. But Amazon is also spend hand over fist and Wall Street is in the mood to buy it.Most recently, CFRA Research increas it price target on AMZN stock from$885 to $975cite the company' aggress across-the-board invest in ""fulfillment, content, hardwar servic and intern expansion.""Th brokerag expect the strategi will pay big dividend for Amazon and an in turn Amazon stock. More aptly, it will at least simplifi the company' variou busi ventur and boost revenues, but at the expens of profit through fiscal year 2018. Befor you tri to knock the trade off, it' a strategi that' benefit AMZN stock investor in a big way.Th 5 Best Stock to Buy for AprilBottom line, Amazon stock is up 20% in 2017 follow last year' 11% rake and 2015' massiv gain of 117%. But is AMZN stock offer today' investor someth worth buying?Amazon Stock Daili ChartClick to EnlargeOn month ago, I ask the question of""i it, or isn't it?""Th refer wa direct at AMZN stock' daili chart. At the time, Amazon share were establish either a bullish cup-with-handl or potenti bearish variat on the classic double-top pattern.Without certain knowledg of what would follow, my forecast wa that Amazon would see some like downsid pressure. The view wa tie to AMZN stock' inabl to charg higher from it handl breakout, less-than-terrif volum and a lack of support from stochastics.I wa wrong on one level, as share are now firmli higher. However, the ensu four-plu week of later consolid (and a few fals move out of the pattern) were like far from easi for bullish AMZN stock investors.Aft a second success break-out attempt last week, Amazon appear modestli extend in the near-term. Mainly, Amazon share are trade outsid the upper Bolling Band for a fifth session and sport an overbought stochast indicator.Consid the situation, the expect is for modest profit-tak befor a higher and sustain stock price might be realized.AMZN (Bullish) Credit Put SpreadIn spite of the prior, modest technic misdiagnosis, I did present a credit put spread as a way for investor to collect incom and buy AMZN stock at a discount. It work out nicely. Obviously, though, at thi point those profit trail those of an investor that simpli purchas shares.Review Amazon' option and onc again, my attent is focus on thi type of vertic strategy. One spread of interest is the April $870/$865 put credit spread. With Amazon stock near $898 the vertic is price for 75 cents.Th 75 cent credit is kept in full if at expir AMZN is abov $870. By use the April contract the trader also doesn't have to necessarili hold a posit through Amazon' next earn event. The strike placement also provid thi cautious bullish trader a margin of safeti of just over 3% versu the current price of AMZN stock.Th real disadvantag with thi strategi is if our forecast is wrong. Similar to last time, if AMZN were to ralli higher by a meaning amount, the trader' 75 cent in profit will look like too conserv of a posit in hindsight.Big Tech Goe to War Over Toshiba Corp (TOSBF) Flash MemoryOn the flip side, the vertic limit the investor' risk to $4.25 regardless of how low AMZN share move dure the spread' hold period. If the investor is a buyer of Amazon stock at lower prices, one trader' loss could work out to a well-discount purchas of $369.25, or a much better deal in the event other investor decid to dump their merchandis far below $365.Invest account under Christoph Tyler' manag do not current own posit in ani of the secur or their deriv mention in thi article.

Amazon & Microsoft: Are These Cloud Computing Leaders in a Growth Slowdown?;4/4/2017;"""The cloud"" and ""cloud computing"" have becom incred buzzwords. It seem most peopl are float around the idea, as the term ambigu suggests, but don't seem to have a grasp on how the cloud functions.Believ to be invent by American psychologist and comput scientist J.C.R. Licklid in the 1960's, cloud comput wa creat to connect data for peopl between locat and times. Now, thi technolog ha vastli grown and made publicli avail by industri leader AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFT.What is the Cloud?In basic terms, cloud comput is access and store data over the Internet. To the end user, benefit of the cloud include: the abil to deliv and manag their own comput resources, scale up or scale down comput level as needed, and onli pay for the amount of comput power they use.Synergi Research Groupshowscloud vendor revenu reach $148 billion in 2016, which account for 25% annual growth. Clearly, thi is a vast and fast grow space. Leader in the movement are chang the tradit notion of access data through hardwar by introduc the idea of retriev data through space, or the cloud.At the end of the day, thi data need to be store somewhere. Compani which offer cloud comput servic alloc massiv and secur server to store the data be held in the cloud. Even though cloud data is not be store in users' person hard drives, is it held somewher and may be vulner to failures.With the rate of growth thi technolog is fli at, it seem cloud comput will soon take over the necess of person hard drive space. The two popularli known leader of the cloud comput busi are known to be: Amazon with AW (Amazon Web Service, Inc) and Microsoft with Azure.How Fast are the Amazon and Microsoft Growing?Amazon' cloud comput service, AWS, launch in 2006. They advertis themselv to deliv larg comput capabl and capac which cost less and take less time than a compani build physic servers. As of 2016, AW offer more than 70 services.Year over Year (Y/Y) growth of AW sale for Amazon were increas until, and as of now peak on, Q2 of 2015 at 81%. Since, AW revenu have been see high growth, but not to the level it onc did. In Q4 of 2016, Y/i net sale growth for AW wa 47%.A similar stori is shown with Microsoft' Azure. Y/i revenu growth (GAAP) of their Azur busi capped, to date, in Q2 of 2016 at 127% growth. Just like AWS, the later quarter show sale growth at a decreas rate with Q4 2016 Y/i revenu growth (GAAP) at 93%.So… Who Cares?Two of the leader in cloud comput platform have not been abl to increas their sale growth of their respect cloud businesses. In an industri which is infam for how fast it is expand into the hand of busi and individuals, these number are concerning.It look like the maximum potenti for Amazon' and Microsoft' sale growth for their cloud comput busi have capped. Unless either compani releas break through cloud comput technolog or break price points, their sale growth rate look to continu decreas consid current levels.Which Stock are Zack Expert Talk About?makeArticleAd();Stock in today' headlin may be tempt buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stock Zacks' team of expert are recommending?

However, by no mean are they abl to compet with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, which domin the e-commerc market space.Th industri is also face major challeng from a still-strong U.S. dollar, volatil commod cost and uncertain econom environment. A strong dollar ha result in lower spend from foreign tourist and is impact retailers' oversea operations. A highli promot environ is also forc retail to slash price thu impact margin negatively.Th not-so-promis scenario in the retail sector is also evid in the perform of theRetail - Supermarketsindustry. Out of the 265 industries, the Retail - Supermarket industri hold a Zack Industri Rank #218, part of the bottom 15% of the Zack Classifi industries. Even the broader Retail and Wholesal sector is at the bottom of the Zack Classifi sector (16 out of 16).Have said this, let' tri to ascertain which of these two key retail - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.WMTor The Kroger CompanyKR-- present make for a better invest option in face of the headwind hamper the retail industry.Look into our proprietari Zack Rank, which is design to predict price movement over the next one to three months, come in handi in thi scenario.

Hence, we should consid it a favor invest option.Valu FundamentalsConsid price-to-earn (P/E) ratio, Kroger look pretti undervalu when compar with the Zack categor Retail-Supermarket industri over the past year.

Dure the next coupl years, GPRO stock would come undone, lose more than 80% of it value.OK then, so what now? What' the futur of GoPro?Good Side of GoProWell, there are actual some silver linings. In mid-March, GPRO announc anupd on it guidance: the forecast is for non-GAAP profit on a full-year basi and that revenu - for the current quarter - will be on the upper end of the previou outlook of $190 million to $210 million.A a result, Wall Street respond with plenti of buying, push GPRO stock up about 19%.The 5 Best Stock to Buy for AprilWhil thi is certainli encouraging, I think investor should still be cautious. Let' face it, GPRO ha had plenti of misstep and misfires. Besides, the sentiment wa alreadi so low that ani kind of good news would be a catalyst for the stock price. It' also import to keep in mind that a hefti 31% of the float for GPRO is in short positions. That is, it seem like a good bet that a part of the bull move ha been the result of a ""short squeeze.""But all such thing are more technic factors. Perhap the most worrisom issu is the brutal action GPRO ha taken, such as to slash the headcount. Note that the compani ha plan to layoff 17% of the workforce. In fact, thi is thethird reduct dure the past two years.Even though the move will result in a substanti drop in oper costs, there will like be a hit to morale. It will also mean fewer resourc for critic R&D as well as staf for sale and marketing.Keep in mind that a big issu with GPRO ha been the qualiti of it products, as seen with the Hero4 and the Karma Drone (which had to be recalled). There wa also the recentshut downof the entertain division.Improv for GPRO Stock?So with the cost cutting, do you think thi will mean thing will get better?Thi seem like a stretch.Meanwhile, the competit environ is onli get tougher. In the camera market, there are rival likeSoni Corp(ADR)(NYSE:SNE),HTC,Garmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) and evenSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP).But of course, the smartphon fromAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) are offer much more camera functionality. Accord to the GPROannual filing: ""it is possibl that, in the future, the manufactur of such devices, such as Apple, Googl and Samsung, may design them for use in a rang of conditions, includ challeng physic environments, or develop product with featur similar to ours.""Oh, and the drone market is also rife with competitors.

Loui Navellier' pick for the contest isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).makeArticleAd();We'r offici through the first quarter, and share ofNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - my top stock for 2017 - finish the quarter with a modest 2% gain. That perform seem like noth to write home about, especi when compar with theS&P 500'snearli 6% gain. However, when it come to the comput graphic company, I predict that a littl patienc will pay off big time. In fact, now is an excel time to pick up NVDA stock befor it explod higher.I'l explain exactli whi in a moment, but first, let' review what weigh on the stock earlier in the quarter. Back in earli February, Nvidia releas perfectli respect fourth-quart results, includ 55% sale growth, 193% EP growth and a healthi 19.3% earn surprise.Nonetheless, some sharehold took the earn report as an excus to lock in their gain - a shortsight move, in my opinion.NVDA share meander lower through earli March.

Why Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

And that hasn't alway been the case. LOW stock tradit ha underperform that of it key rival,Hom Depot Inc(NYSE:HD). Even exclud HD' higher dividend yield, investor in HD stock have receiv about 30 percentag point more return over the last five year than their counterpart in Lowe' stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (modified)But LOW stock may be posit to outperform HD stock - and the market overal - go forward.Lowe' stock ha a number of catalyst in it favor at the moment. With a bit of cooper from the hous markets, LOW stock should be one of the better-perform large-cap over the next few years.Strong Quarter and Year for LOW StockLowe' stock jump 9.5% after the company' first-quart report in earli March, and with good reason. Result were strong across the board. Adjust earnings-per-shar of $0.86 crush consensu expect of $0.79, and increas a sharp 46% year-over-year. Even consid some like help from better weather in key markets, that' a huge earn increas for an establish company. Full-year adjust EP rose 21%, with same-stor sale up 4.2%, includ a 5.1% jump in Q4.Admittedly, Lowe' same-stor sale in Q4 were a bit below those of HD, but the gap is smaller than it ha been of late. Meanwhile, guidanc for 3.5% comp look possibl conservative, and Lowe' expect to turn those revenu into a 16% increas in earn per share - even with FY16 (end Januari 2017) have an extra week, and thu a tougher comparison. And it certainli appear that Lowe' stock ha room to grow consider beyond just next year.Th 10 Best Stock of the S&P 500 in Q1Can Lowe' Stock Outperform HD Stock?Look forward, there are a number of multi-year catalyst behind LOW stock. The gap between Home Depot and Lowe' in term of revenu seem to be narrowing. Home Depot outperform LOW stock by 200 bp for the full year, but just 70 bp in Q4. The natur of increment margin are such that if Lowe' can grab a few more dollar from it rival, it earn should expand nicely.Meanwhile, the hous cycl seem to impli a tailwind for both LOW stock and HD. Hous start number have been solid so far in 2017, and renov activ appear to be pick up as well. Both bode well for sale to not onli do-it-yourself individu customers, but the large-volum commerci client that drive a good chunk of Lowe' revenue.And there' one more, somewhat hidden, catalyst: The continu declin ofSear Hold Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD). Sear compet with Lowe' in both hardwar and appliances. And the revenu be shed by thatstruggl company- both through store closur and declin same-stor sale - ha to go somewhere. Sear (not includ Kmart) saw revenu declin by $1.5 billion in it most recent fiscal year. Some of those lost sale will make their way to Lowe's.In fact, one analyst ha estimateda 50-plu basi point tailwindto compar sale for both Lowe' and Home Depoteach yearfrom Sears' struggles. And with the declin at that retail not like to end ani time soon, if ever, that benefit should persist for some time.Bottom Line on LOWAnd yet, Lowe' stock is price veri reasonably. LOW trade at about 15x it FY17 guidanc of $4.64. In comparison, HD trade at over 18x it guidanc and a two-turn premium on an EV/EBITDA basis, as well.If Lowe' can narrow the growth gap - as it ha done of late - the valuat gap between LOW stock and HD should narrow in turn. A 19x multipl plu the 1.7% dividend paid by Lowe' stock impli about a 9% return over the next year. Ani outperformance, or strength in the industri as a whole, put total return into the double-digit on a percentag basis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hit New Highs, Threaten Massiv BreakoutAnd I'd expect some outperform thi year - and perhap a rise tide for both HD and LOW in term of earn and multiples. Consum confid is up. Home builder are optimistic. Few, if any, retail have the same protect from e-commerc andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Lowe' stock is near an all-tim high, but hit $100 by 2018 hardli seem an outrag expectation. A 19-20x multipl - up modestli due to rise optim - and $5+ in 2018 EP get the stock into the tripl digits.That' a 20%+ return in as littl as a year, and that' worth pay attent to.

Meanwhile,th scandal thi weekatAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTub is anoth exampl of what a mess the onlin advertis industri is. The more the rest of the busi struggles, the more obviou the valu of the Facebook platform becomes. And that should lead to further upsid for FB stock.YouTube, Twitter and Facebook StockGoogl ha a problem on it hand with YouTube. Major advertis - such as the U.K. oper ofMcDonald' Corporation(NYSE:MCD),Starbuck Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) andJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) - havepulledal non-search advertising.Th boycott is estim to cost Alphabet$750 million to $1 billion in revenue. It seem highli like that some - if not most - of that spend will make it way to Facebook. Those brand still want to advertis onlin - and Facebook will be the best option left standing.Th 5 Best Stock to Buy for AprilAft all,Twitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) ha it own well-docu problem with ""hate speech,"" one reason whi ad growth on that platform ha stall out. Facebook content can be controversi from time to time, but FB' control look stronger.To be sure, Facebook ha had some advertis issu of it own. Late last year, the compani disclos a seri of measur errors, includ an overstat of the so-cal ""reach"" of advertis campaigns. But Facebook at least ha been on top of it problem - and is fix them. Twitter and YouTub are play from behind at the moment.Th Onlin Advertis Ecosystem Is BrokenTh problem at YouTub are just a singl exampl of an onlin advertis ecosystem that look increasingli troubled. Twitter by it own admiss ha had troubl keep major advertis and provid consist ROI. And the Lesli Jone debacl last year, along with consist effort to remov bot and battl hate speech, ha hurt that platform' reputation.For it part, Googl ha repeatedli had to chang it term to combat fraud, adwar and malware. And beyond the major platforms, there' further worri for advertisers.Criteo SA (ADR)(NASDAQ:CRTO) and privat held SteelHous hada nasti lawsuitlast year, with each compani accus the other of click fraud and other malfeasance. One estim suggest that fraud takesabout one-thirdof onlin ad spending.For major advertisers, in particular, onlin advertis is becom a minefield. The content next to which ad are place can't be trusted. Measur of campaign ROI is suscept to error and fraud. Advertis clearli are pay for bogu traffic - even on mobile.In that context, Facebook - if it can convinc advertis it' conquer it measur error - present a compel altern to tradit onlin advertis spend. And if more issu like the YouTub ad boycott aris - and they will - ad demand should onli increase, and that should push Facebook stock higher.Bottom Line on Facebook StockTher are two core risk to Facebook stock. The first is that traffic to the platform will decline, particularli if consum find new social media outlets. So far, neither Twitter norSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) ha proven abl to peel away much traffic.Th second risk is whether advertis will keep their dollar on the site or take them elsewhere. That risk ha been highlight of late by Facebook' own guidanc and by last year' measur errors.Al Hope Is Fade for Sprint Corp (S) StockBut that risk is diminish by the struggl at Facebook' peers, which make FB advertis look more attract - and more secur - by comparison. And with both risk rather low on a near-term basis, it' hard not to see more upsid for FB stock. There' no debt, still-impress earn growth, and a multipl not far from that of the broad market as a whole.Indeed, Facebook stock is attract enough on it own.

The compani did add a ""search"" featur to Snapchat, but that' not big news rel to the $27 billion valuat current assign to SNAP.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the narr surround Snap stock ha been persist and consist negative.Analyst downgradesmet the stock almost immediately, lead SNAP to tumbl after earli post-IPO gains.Complaint about the lack of vote right afford Snap stock holder have led to call that the company' own IPO wa the sign of a bubbl in thebroad market.Then when analyst from firm that underwrot the SNAP IPO, includ Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley, give Buy-equival rate to the stock, there were thepredict howlsthat major invest firm were unfairli support the stock price. Littl over a month after the SNAP IPO, it seem downright contrarian - if not uneth - to issu posit commentari on Snap stock.I certainli understand some of the skepticism; with Snap stock trade at ~60x revenue, valuat risk is obvious.FB Open Much, Much Wors Than SNAPBut investor jump on the ""bash Snap"" bandwagon, or think SNAP is a slam-dunk short, should bear in mind theearli tradingof social media giantFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB):""Facebook Inc share slid below $29 to a new low on Tuesday as nervou investor fled the company' shares, concern about the social network' long-term busi prospect and an initi offer price that prove too rich …Wall Street ha harbor concern that Facebook, while boast nearli a billion user worldwid and domin Internet social-networking, would have difficulti translat it grow presenc on smartphon and other mobil devic into revenue.""That quot come from a Reuter articl written May 29, 2012 - just eleven day after the FB IPO. The IPO itself wa a mess, too, and wide refer to as someth close to a disaster. Indeed,Nasdaq Inc(NASDAQ:NDAQ) wasfin $10 millionfor system failur dure FB' first day of trading.7 'Best of the Best' Stock to Buy for the Second QuarterIt onli got wors from there. By September, FB trade below $18, down more than 50% from it IPO price. And it' difficult not to hear echo of the Snap IPO in Facebook' own coverag at the time. An ""initi offer price that prove too rich"". Snap stock' lack of vote right compar to the disclosur that FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg would control the companyeven when he died.And FB stock in it first six month of trade had the same feel Snap stock doe now. It wa ""muppet bait"": a stock that would burn retail investors. The valuat wa crazy. There were even call that the Facebook IPO wa the sign of a ""new tech bubble"" - the same as those made now. Of course, FB investor now are sing a veri differ tune.Facebook Growth Doesn't Make Snap Stock a BuyThat' not to say, at all, that SNAP is a buy simpli becaus Facebook stock is up ~700% from those all-tim low in Septemb 2012. Snap stock is expens anda long way from profitability, as my colleagu Jame Brumley ha point out.But there are two lesson investor interest in SNAP should glean from Facebook' first few month as a public company. The first is that it might be OK to show some patience. Earli post-IPO trade is volatile; it' better suit to equiti and option traders, not investors. The market is still figur out fair valu for Snap stock, and that take some time, and a lot of arguments. Lock-up expirations, which allow pre-IPO investor to cash out at design times, still loom, and could further pressur SNAP.Th second lesson, however, is to tune out the noise. The armchair analyst question the valuat of Facebook stock, or claim some sort of bubble, were flat wrong. There wa no tech bubble; not onli ha FB stock soared, but the NASDAQ 100 ha better than doubled. Investor who listen to dire, media-baiting, predict miss out on a lot of valu - and not just that creat by Facebook stock.Giv Snap Stock A ChanceSnap stock might turn out to be a worthwhil investment. It might not. Either way, it is not a sign of the financi apocalypse. The lack of vote right onli make offici what investor in Facebook andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) alreadi have through their perman minor vote rights: No control.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Escap Thi Storm Anytim SoonThere' littl effect differ between Snap stock and Alphabet stock from a govern standpoint. (The same is true among the class ofUnd Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) stock, which presentsan intrigu arbitrag opportunity.)And yes, Snap stock is expensive, but expens stock can stay expens for a veri long time - or grow into their valuations. Just look atAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). The next time you hear a snap judgment (pun intended) short case for SNAP, rememb what theWashington Postwrot about the Googl IPOin 2004:""Thi price is insane. And anyon buy Googl as a long-term invest at $109.40 will lose money … Thi ha noth to do with Googl as a compani … It ha to do with math and with limit factor - fanci languag for the old truism that no tree grow to the sky.""Thos voic are alway out there. Don't listen to them alone. Do your own research, and give Snap stock a chance.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best Stock of the S&P 500 in Q110 Stock You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right Now3 Entertain Stock to Buy as Summer ApproachesTh postBefor You Dismiss Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock, Rememb Facebook Inc (FB)appear first onInvestorPlace."

I thinkAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a great company. It is the Vampir Squid of the internet commerc space, devour everyth in it way. I just don't like the stock price at these levels. Given the near-parabol ascent of the recent rally, I expect AMZN stock to pull back from these extremes.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Seyfang via FlickrIt is import to rememb that the last earn report show a pretti big miss on revenues, with$43.74 billion in sale versu expect of $44.68 billion.Guid wa also lower to a rang of $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion compar to a previou guidanc of $35.95 billion.Whil sale havegrown 27% over the past year,th stock price ha risen nearli 50% in that same time frame. Thi mean the price-to-sal ratio ha nearli doubl over the past year, drive the price-to-sal ratio to 3.2. Thi is the highest level sinc 2005 and well abov the five-year averag of 2.2.Amazon is now the fourth-largest compani in the U. with a market cap of $425 billion. As a comparison,Wal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT) sport a market cap of $220 billion, mean AMZN stock is be valu at almost twice the level of WMT. Yet Walmart had $482 billion in revenu in 2016 versu onli $136 billion for Amazon.Th 5 Best Stock to Buy for AprilSo AMZN stock is twice the price with onli 28% of the sale … tough for such a huge compani to grow into such an extrem multiple.

After all,Daniel Salmonof BMO Capit Market recent rais hi target price for Amazon to $1,200 - more than a third higher than current levels.A look at the technic paint a similar overextend picture, though.

Stock recent featur in the blog includeApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Fre Report),Qualcomm(NASDAQ:QCOM-Fre Report),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Fre Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report) andSAP(NYSE:SAP-Fre Report).Today, Zack is promot it ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Her are highlight from Monday' Analyst Blog:Appl (AAPL) Roundup: iPhon Still Drive SharesAppl (NASDAQ:AAPL-Fre Report) is a veri solid compani although there remain concern about possibl problem with iPhon sale growth, a lack of innov and problem in China. But the compani ha nearli doubl it cash over the past two year while continu to spend heavili on R&D. Sinc it hold a lot of it cash overseas, Appl ha been gradual leverag the balanc sheet to return cash to shareholders. As a result, it debt-cap ratio ha gone from 22.8% two year ago to 39.8% in the last quarter, still at veri accept levels.Appl beat estim nice in the fourth quarter, in which it also regain it posit as the number one smartphon vendor in the world accord to both IDC and Gartner. It also continu to take home most of the profit in the smartphon business.Appl is also build the hype for the next iPhone, creat the impress that it will be revolutionary. So Appl share continu to appreci steadily, much faster that the S&P 500.All About the iPhon 8What' in a Name: Appl hasn't said what it' go to call the new $1,000 iPhone, which everyon think will contain highli innov chang sinc thi is the 10-year anniversari of the iPhone. But that hasn't stop peopl from tri to guess: the most common (and boring) refer is the iPhon 8 (sinc we'r current on the 7 series) or iPhon 10, or iPhon X, but some are also call it the iPhon Edit (from Watch Edition, which is it most expens watch).Get Curvy: The WSJ report earlier that some iPhon model may have a curv display (use OLE will allow thi as oppos to earlier gener LCD that couldn't be bent), but subsequ report from Nikkei and MacRumour indic that the curvatur will onli be slight sinc it ""compromis structur integrity, warp the user interfac over the side and lead to innumer accident touch - especi when hold a phone in one hand"". (Galaxi 8 leak reportedli indic a similar design for the same reasons.)S Matters: The high-end model are be rumor to have OLE screen of 5.1, 5.5, or 5.8-inches.Dress to Kill:Appl is experi with materials, so the next iPhon could have a glass front and back with aluminum chassis. But we also hear that Appl is experi with white ceram becaus it is more scratch-resist and durabl than steel.Hom Sweet Home: In choos the edge-to-edg OLE screen, Appl probabl ha to do away with the Home button, an indic that the touch ID will be replac with facial or retin scan technology. Appl ha been award a patent for ""enhanc face detect use depth information"" that may be use to enhanc facial recognit or enabl 3D selfi or AR in the iPhone.Charg Up: Appl could be consid wireless or USB-C charging. Wireless is definit more interest and some peopl think that Apple' wireless charg won't requir you to place the phone near a charg plate. Instead, Appl is test Energous' ""WattUp"" technology, wherein a wireless charg transmitt broadcast waveform to receiv and then surround them with a radio frequenc that charg up to 12 devic from up to 15 feet away.L to the Party: Appl usual launch it latest iPhon in September, but thi year could be differ becaus of compon issues. French news site iGener say that the iPhone' 3D imag sensor be made by STMicroelectron like won't be readi for a Septemb launch.Ther are also some OLE suppli constraints, as Samsung wont make enough thi year and Sharp/Hon Hai like won't be readi until next year. However, sinc the 7S and 7S Plu model won't be use the 3D sensor they may make it within that timeframe.Oth NewsAppl Take Qualcomm Lawsuit to the UKApple' relationship with a long-tim supplier continu to sour with anoth case file by the iPhon maker, thi time in the UK. The case wa appar file in January, when Appl also su Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM-Fre Report) in the U.S. for a billion dollar for withhold rebat in lieu of an agreement not to use chip from competitors. But it' onli just gone public.Appl said at the time that Qualcomm' decis not to pay the rebat wa in the natur of a ""punishment"" for cooper with Korean author in a case where Qualcomm wa ultim fine $853 million for it anti-competit practices. Appl is also say that Qualcomm overcharg for it standard essenti patent and also charg for technolog it hasn't developed.Appl Sharehold MeetAt the annual sharehold meeting, Appl consid nine proposals, of which four were it own and five came from shareholders. Onli Apple' propos were approved.On the product front, Appl promis that Mac Pro custom wouldn't be ignor in the push to launch better iPhon as the creativ segment remain import to it. On the iPhon front, he express satisfact that the current lineup of SE, 7 and 7 Plu gener sale that were abov compani expectations. Cook also said that that the airpod were a ""cultur phenomenon."" As far as other product are concerned, Appl is fight to meet demand for the Watch Seri 2 and work to launch other new product (possibl an AR device).Appl Pay adopt is slower in the U.S. than internationally, Appl Music subscrib are at 20 million and App Store subscrib (includ those for servic like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Fre Report) are now 150 million.Anoth import question address by the CEO wa with respect to U.S. manufacturing. He said that two-third of Appl job were in the U.S. (Appl ha creat 2 million American jobs) and he would work to bring more. He also mention that Appl had paid out $50 billion to U.S. supplier in 2016. In the meantime, favor tax rule could see Appl bring back more cash. While divers remain a focu area, a propos to make it more bind on manag wa shot down by shareholders.Appl remain commit to green initi and said that it wa alreadi run 93% of it oper on clean energy.Finally, on net neutrality, Cook said that while the compani didn't engag in politics, it would be involv in polici formation. To that end, it would engag on net neutral issues. Note that new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai recent said that net neutral wa a mistake, while Apple' posit ha alway been that everyone' content should be treat equal.U.S. Manufactur UpdateApple' manufactur partner Foxconn ha said that while the U.S. may lack the suppli chain and high-skil labor requir for iPhon manufactur in the country, he wa open to set up oper there if the govern offer suitabl incentives. Foxconn reportedli get billion of dollar in tax and other incent in China where it ha it factories.A flat panel display factori ha long been rumor in Pennsylvania, and the lack of incent is like the reason it hasn't materi yet. New York is also in the run at present, but CEO Terri Gou say that if the process isn't speed up, he might end up final the deal with Pennsylvania after all.Appl Continu to Woo ChinaAppl ha announc that it will open two more R&D center in Shanghai and Suzhou, in addit to the two R&D center in Beij and Shenzhen. The invest further Apple' state object of spend at least 3.5 billion yuan ($507.1 million) on R&D in China. All four center are expect to be oper thi year.Th invest will help Appl pleas the Chines author and tap into local talent to get closer to customers. Rise local competit ha hurt Apple' busi in China. It' also possibl that some prospect iPhon buyer are wait for the more revolutionari iPhon 8 (or whatev Appl call it).Appl in IndiaAppl is expect to start assembl of the iPhon SE in India at partner Wistron' Bengaluru plant after the model did rel well in the countri and the govern ask Appl to start Indian manufactur if it showroom are to be approved. Appl is go ahead with an initi product volum of 300K-400K unit thi month as it await the Indian government' respons to a request for tax concessions. It argument is that India-mad phone won't be competit without the tax waiver and Indian author have signal that the demand is workable.Appl Spaceship Complex Call Appl ParkApple' new 175-acr ring-shap campu includ the 1000-seat auditorium (Steve Job Theater) is be occupi thi month. By summer-end, Appl expect to bring 12K peopl to the location. For employees, Appl will have two mile of walk and run paths, an orchard, a meadow and a pond. Place open to the public will includ a visitor' center, an Appl Store and a café. It will be power by 17MW rooftop solar panels.Appl Hire Fire TV HeadTimothi D. Twerdahl, former director and GM of Amazon' (NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report) Fire TV unit is join Appl as it Appl TV product market chief. Twerdahl, who ha also work at Hulu and Netflix, will replac Pete Distad who is move over to content.SAP-Appl Softwar KitTh two compani have releas a softwar develop kit that will help the 2.5 million develop custom SAP' (NYSE:SAP-Fre Report) financi and logist softwar to make use of Apple' softwar stacks, especi with respect to iOS, fingerprint sign-on and locat awareness. For instance, the iPhon fingerprint sensor could be all that' need for employe to log in to SAP systems.Appl Pay Score Import Win in AustraliaIn respons to Apple' content that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Nation Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Bank Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaid Bank Ltd were look for a free ride, they have told the Australian Competit & Consum Commiss (ACCC) that on the contrary, Apple' polici attempt to prevent competit in wallets. Becaus if Appl allow them access to it NFC antenna, they would pledg their particip in the Appl Pay rollout.Th Australian Retail Associ ha back the banks, make their own submiss that the collect negoti would be benefici for ""all banks, merchants, app develop and ultim custom in Australia and overseas.""Australian law allow such collect bargaining, provid it is approv by the government.

Moreover, thi seem a better choic becaus rapid chang in the emerg payment landscap made it ""uncertain how competit may develop.""Smartphon Data Favor AppleFollow a report from IDC that put Appl in the posit of top smartphon vendor worldwid in the fourth quarter and Canaccord Genuity' estim that it also took 92% of smartphon profits, Gartner issu a report that wa much in agreement with IDC' findings. Accord to Gartner, Appl wa the top vendor with 17.9% share, edg past Samsung, which wa hurt by the Note 7 recal that onli allow it a 17.8% share (it had a 20.7% share in the fourth quarter of 2015).

Blue Apron ha built it brand around use ingredi that are fresh, natural-it meat are rais on antibiotic- and hormone-fre diets-and ""perfectli pre-measured"" so that there' no waste. The compani sourc from ""artisan purveyor and hundr of family-run farm that support sustain practices.""Blu Apron is not cheap. A two-person plan provid three recip per week for $59.94 ($9.99 per serving) and a famili plan offer either two or four recip per week for $69.92 or $139.84, respect ($8.74 per serving). Factor in ani other food cost for the week, and an individual' or family' groceri bill becom even more expensive.Bustl CompetitionBlu Apron is not alon in the meal-kit deliveri industry. It is quit the opposite. There are so mani meal-kit deliveri compani on the market that it is difficult to choos which one to try. In fact, there seem to be a compani that special in almost everi food trend or dietari prefer out there.On of Blue Apron' biggest competitor isPlated. While the two compani are nearli identical, Plate ha work to differenti itself from Blue Apron by offer more divers meal choic and ad dessert. Subscript cost rang from $48 per week (two dinner for two people; $6 ship fee) to $168 per week (seven dinner for two people; free shipping). It recip featur fresh produc and specialti cut of meat and seafood that vari base on market price.Anoth big rival isHelloFresh. Just like Blue Apron and Plated, HelloFresh deliv a box of fresh, pre-measur ingredi and recip straight to your doorstop everi week. It Classic Plan, which cost $69-$99 per week for two people; the Veggi Plan is special design for vegetarians, and cost $59 or $109 per week for two or four people; and the Famili Plan, which cost $79.95-$105 per week. The compani ha partner with celebr chef Jami Oliver, who is respons for mani of it recipes.Purpl Carrotspeci in vegan recipes, and cost between $68-$74 per week; former food columnist ofTh New York TimesMark Bittman co-found the company. There'sSun Basket, an organ meal deliveri servic that offer paleo diet and gluten free options, andHom Chef, which tout a person menu base on your input meal preferences.PeachDishi a meal-kit deliveri servic that distinguish themselv by their Southern-inspir fare, and then there'sMarley Spoon, the Berlin-bas compani that recentlypartneredwith Martha Stewart.Reinv CookingTh advantag to meal-kit deliveri servic like Blue Apron are well-known-convenience, less waste, well-balanc meals. It' a kitchen innov that' chang how some peopl cook and prepar food at home. Blue Apron and it mani rival have arriv at an almost perfect moment in our digit era. Our tast and prefer have been polish by restaurants, famers' markets, and food televis networks; we want fresh and organically, natur rais products, but abov all, efficiency.Blu Apron ha built it brand around these three qualities, as well as introduc it custom to rare, exot ingredients. It kit are perfect for those want to learn how to cook, and cook with confidence, and to learn how to cook and appreci these atyp recip components.It also offer an instant lifestyl upgrade. Enough food for three separ meal is deliv right to your doorstep, elimin the need to trek to the groceri store onc a week. With Blue Apron, custom don't have to worri about find all of the ingredi for a recipe. Everyth you need, in the exact amount you need, is neatli packag and readi to be turn into a basic homemad meal.On of the biggest strength of compani like Blue Apron is the declin in food waste. Becaus it sourc from local farms, Blue Apron avoid much of the wast that come with fli in produc or other product intern to your groceri store, which requir a ton of packaging. Product typic come in crate instead of corrug box when suppli locally.CriticismBlu Apron, however, ha it downfalls. Most apparent, and perhap a big reason to hesitate, is the price, and Blue Apron is one of the cheaper options.Most ready-to-cook meal deliveri fall between $10-$15 in the price-per-serv range. Whether or not you consid thi outrag expens or a good deal-depend on your eat and shop habits-it' fair to assum that with servic like Blue Apron, you pay a premium for the conveni of have a high-qual meal plan out for you and deliv right to your home. Popular food publicationEaterasksan interest question: ""Are servic like Blue Apron the futur of home-cook food, or are they a mindless extravag for wealthi Americans?""Whil encourag peopl to cook at home, Blue Apron may also be take the joy out of cooking. There' no more trip to the groceri store or farmer' market to seek out fresh produc and meat, a journey that connect you to the ingredi you are about to consume. Custom could potenti lose sight of where their food come from.Whil Blue Apron is known for work with local farmer to sourc their ingredients, someth they should be commend for, it custom may onli know that their food arriv in pre-packag quantiti in a refriger box on their doorstep. The compani doe includ inform about it local supplier in it boxes, on it Facebook page, and throughout it website, but sinc their typic custom may be too busi to go groceri shopping, there' a good chanc they'll be too busi to read the includ brochures.Blu Apron doe a great job reduc food waste, but it environment impact should also be considered. Each of it box includ sometim extran packag choices-lik small plastic bag for two or three carrot or littl plastic contain of soy sauce-and sinc recip ingredi are alreadi portion out, each ingredi arriv separ in plastic containers. Each plastic package, however, is recyclable, but Blue Apron could easili combin some ingredi and reduc the amount of plastic it uses.Head Toward an IPO?Last July,Bloombergreportedthat Blue Apron held preliminari talk with bank about way to rais capital, includ the potenti for an initi public offering. Now, the compani ha chosen Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup to lead it IPO that could come as soon as thi fall, accord toReuters, who cite peopl familiar with the matter.Th compani is current valu at $2 billion, with $193 million in total equiti funding. Blue Apron, which is not yet profitable, gener roughli $750 million in revenu last year, said Reuters' sources. With an IPO, Blue Apron could see it valuat spike to $3 billion.Blu Apron is now ship about eight million meal to custom nationwid everi month, accord toTh New York Times, up from five million meal per month in Octob of 2015.Back in 2015, Blue Apron brought on Brad Dickerson as chief financi officer, the former CFO and COO at Under ArmourUAA. ""Brad bring deep experi in scale fast-grow icon brands, and we expect hi leadership will be an invalu asset to the compani as we continu to grow at a rapid pace,"" CEO Salzberg said in a statement. Mr. Dickerson would undoubtedli bring experi dure an IPO process.Whil Blue Apron' IPO plan are not yet set in stone, the compani is one to keep an eye on. The company' busi model, like that of all meal-kit deliveri services, is thriving, partli becaus it doe not have to maintain giant refriger warehouses, nor doe it have too much retail oper costs.Blu Apron is join rank with anoth digit food tool: popular onlin groceri deliveri servic like Instacart, Peapod, and Amazon.com Inc.'sAMZNPrim offering. Together, groceri deliveri and meal-kit have upend the way in which we thing about cooking, groceri shopping, and eat food, a trend that investor should consid seriously.Groceri stalwarts, though, should not be discard quit yet. Wal-Mart Store Inc.WMT, who' partner with Uber and Lyft, offer it own version of groceri delivery, while Whole Food MarketWFMha reportedli partner and invest in Instacart.

Amazon Fresh Pickup Is a Tough Sell;4/3/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) announc it latest initi in groceri thi week. The e-commerc giant is take the wrap off of it new AmazonFresh pickup service, which allow custom to place an order onlin and pick it up in as littl as 15 minut from a drive-in kiosk. The compani is beta-test two locat in Seattle, which are current open onli to Amazon employe but are expect to be readi for the gener public soon.Unlik the Amazon Go cashier-less conveni store the compani is current testing, which reli on a network of camera and sensor to automat charg customers, the AmazonFresh pickup servic is not a new idea. Rival likeWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) andKrog Co(NYSE: KR) have alreadi open hundr of such pickup kiosk at their store and are expand them quickly. Wal-Mart plan to have close to a thousand of them by the end of the year.makeArticleAd();An uphil battleWith it Prime membership program and e-commerc scale, Amazon usual oper from a posit of strength, but that isn't the case here. The compani is at a number of disadvantag as it open anoth front in the groceri industry.First, Wal-Mart and Kroger have a clear head start with hundr of kiosk alreadi up and running. If Amazon want to truli compet with them, it would need to open hundr of it own locat across the country. Without it own consumer-fac real estat like Wal-Mart and Kroger have, Amazon need to find and convert space to open more pickup centers, a time-consuming, expensive, and difficult task. Economically, it' much more effici for Wal-Mart and Kroger to provid such a servic sinc they onli need to build a kiosk in a store park lot at one of their thousand of stores.Curiously, Amazon' new pickup locat don't also offer custom the option of come into the store, as most groceri shopper still do. That mean the compani will lose out on impuls purchas from shopper pass by the location, or from those who simpli prefer to select their produc themselves. Build out what' essenti a groceri store without allow custom to enter it seem like a mistake.Finally, the servic is onli avail to Prime members, and the 15-minut order window is exclus to AmazonFresh members, who pay an addit $15/month for that service. With approxim half of American household alreadi sign up for Prime, Amazon like isn't lose mani potenti custom sinc those who would consid Amazon for food shop are probabl alreadi Prime members, but posit Fresh pickup as an exclus benefit worth pay for creat an odd juxtaposition. Wal-Mart, the groceri leader, offer it pickup servic for free, to everyone. Kroger' ClickList, on the other hand, cost $4.95 per order.Th big questionWho exactli is AmazonFresh Pickup for?In most metro areas, Amazon alreadi offer it Fresh groceri deliveri service, which, for an addit $15/month, provid same-day or next-day deliveri to customers' doorsteps. And sinc the new pickup servic exclud non-Prim members, the target market seem to be onli peopl who pay for Prime, but aren't will to spend the extra $15/month to get groceri delivered. After all, if custom are will to place order on their phones, the addit conveni of get deliveri rather than schlep to the pick-up site seem worth the monthli fee.Imag source: Amazon.With such a narrow target market, AmazonFresh Pickup just doesn't seem to make good busi sense. Wal-Mart introduc such a program as a compromis between delivery, which it found to be too expensive, and the tradit form of in-stor groceri shopping. The pickup servic offer more conveni than enter a store, but less than delivery, and it carri no addit cost. That work for Wal-Mart becaus it alreadi ha the infrastructur and store network to make pickup easi and cost-effective. Amazon doe not.Th Fresh Pickup launch is clearli an experiment, and Amazon may not expand it nationwide. But 10 year after the compani first launch Fresh, it' still grasp for a foothold in the $800 billion U.S. groceri market. The groundbreak technolog featur in the Amazon Go store ha the potenti to disrupt the industry, but the delay in it public open is not encouraging.A for AmazonFresh Pickup, the servic is at a disadvantag to competitor both from a custom perspect and a busi one. For now, Amazon still seem stuck in a supermarket no-man' land.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While the industri gain 19.7%, the stock regist growth of 19.0%.The underperform of the stock could be due to stiff competit in the cloud space and the PC market.However, we expect the stock to rebound in the rest of 2017 given such strateg move be made from the company' end.Focu Remain on CloudWith Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft remain focus on it ""cloud first, mobil first"" motto and the recent announc is anoth step in that direction.

The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for April;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsContrari to popular belief, April isn't a letharg month for the market. Follow on from what' usual a bullish March, theS&P 500, on average, gain 1.2% for the month that just started. So it' OK to hunt down stock to buy without worri about everi pick be a dead end.makeArticleAd();Source:Jocelyn Kinghorn via FlickrPerhap thi time around will be different. The index is typic up onli 2.1% year-to-d at the end of March, but the S&P 500 is up about 5% thi year so far. That set the stage for some profit taking.Nevertheless, the tendenc is the tendency, and there are a hand of stock that tend to do well in April regardless of the situat or the environment.7 'Best of the Best' Stock to Buy for the Second QuarterHere' a look at the five best stock to buy for gain in April, base on their histor performances.Best Stock to Buy for April: Amazon (AMZN)There' never realli a bad time to buyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN); AMZN share seem to defi graviti year-round. But, for whatev reason, April is an unusu bullish for month for the e-commerc giant' stock.Amazon gain an averag of 9.2% thi month.Th stock is ahead of it normal pace for the year-to-date, up over 18% versu a normal year-to-d advanc of 5.2%. That' not apt to be a major headwind for Amazon though. Thi stock can do some pretti amaz thing at times.And, with the latest on-demand video rhetor say Amazon rather thanNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) isquickli becom Hollywood' prefer partner, anybodi on the fenc may well be motiv to pull the trigger on an AMZN trade.Best Stock to Buy for April: Mastercard (MA)Of the five top stock to buy for April gains,Mastercard Inc(NYSE:MA) is easili the most trade-lik (and least investment-like) of them all.That is to say, while April is gener a veri good month for MA, there' rare ani follow-through in May or beyond. Moreover, there' not much in the way of broader tailwind push MasterCard right now.Th 7 Best Stock to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementNonetheless, April' averag 4.8% gain for MasterCard make it a pretti good bet here, particularli see how 2017' performance-to-d is right in line with the stock' typic annual path.Best Stock to Buy for April: Home Depot (HD)A wa note last month, after year of lag it bigger rival,Lowe' Companies, Inc.(NYSE:LOW) is finallystart to pose a real threattoHom Depot Inc(NYSE:HD).Don't readtoomuch into that shift though. Home Depot is still a forc to be reckon with, and Home Depot ishead into it prime time of year with a full head of steam. Namely, the home improv retail is fire on all cylind with it e-commerc effort, and the countri is go into the busiest part of the homebuild season with great expect for a banner 2017.It' thi season that like doe most of the heavi lift for HD thi time of year. The stock usual gain 2.9% in April.A the perform chart abov illustr though, Home Depot isn't best view as a one-month trade. In May, HD typic log a 4% gain. That make Home Depot one of the better stock to buy for the nexttwomonths.Best Stock to Buy for April: Unit Technolog Corpor (UTX)Hom improv retail aren't the onli stock that exhibit a bullish tendenc around thi time of year. Defens contractor name heat up thi time of year as well (albeit for less clear reasons).On of the major name in thi group that look well posit for a big April isUnit Technolog Corporation(NYSE:UTX). It' onli up 1.8% year-to-date, and is normal up 5.4% by thi point. Better yet, UTX share gain an averag of 3.5% in April. That' not a giant move, but it' big enough to bet on when the stock is alreadi so far behind for the year.Th 7 Best REIT to Buy for Big (And Growing!) YieldsJust note that, like Mastercard shares, Unit Technolog share don't gener much follow-through beyond the end of April.Best Stock to Buy for April: Intel (INTC)Last but not least, April is gener a solid month forIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) shares, but April 2017 may be an especi hot month for the stock in light of the fact that INTC share are decidedli below their normal pace for the year.Histor speaking, they'r suppos to be up 6.6% between the end of the year and the end of March. Thi year, though, they'r down 0.3%. Ergo, the usual 5.3% gain we see from INTC thi month could be much greater as the stock play catch-up.To the extent a catalyst is need to jump-start such a move, BlueFin Research Partner analyst Steve Mullan may have just provid it,say thi morning:""Our one-quart lag product model suggest that INTC product plan thi quarter remain ahead the current Wall Street revenu consensu of -3.0% for the June quarter. Our latest Q1 PC OEM shipment read indic a stronger than expect March, result in shipment slightli abov the high-end of our forecast rang of 64-65M units.""A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Th postTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Aprilappear first onInvestorPlace."
Apple Roundup: iPhone Still Drives Apple Shares;4/3/2017;"AppleAAPLi a veri solid compani although there remain concern about possibl problem with iPhon sale growth, a lack of innov and problem in China. But the compani ha nearli doubl it cash over the past two year while continu to spend heavili on R&D. Sinc it hold a lot of it cash overseas, Appl ha been gradual leverag the balanc sheet to return cash to shareholders. As a result, it debt-cap ratio ha gone from 22.8% two year ago to 39.8% in the last quarter, still at veri accept levels.Appl beat estim nice in the fourth quarter, in which it also regain it posit as the number one smartphon vendor in the world accord to both IDC and Gartner. It also continu to take home most of the profit in the smartphon business.Appl is also build the hype for the next iPhone, creat the impress that it will be revolutionary. So Appl share continu to appreci steadily, much faster that the S&P 500.All About the iPhon 8What' in a Name: Appl hasn't said what it' go to call the new $1,000 iPhone, which everyon think will contain highli innov chang sinc thi is the 10-year anniversari of the iPhone. But that hasn't stop peopl from tri to guess: the most common (and boring) refer is the iPhon 8 (sinc we'r current on the 7 series) or iPhon 10, or iPhon X, but some are also call it the iPhon Edit (from Watch Edition, which is it most expens watch).Get Curvy: The WSJ report earlier that some iPhon model may have a curv display (use OLE will allow thi as oppos to earlier gener LCD that couldn't be bent), but subsequ report from Nikkei and MacRumour indic that the curvatur will onli be slight sinc it ""compromis structur integrity, warp the user interfac over the side and lead to innumer accident touch - especi when hold a phone in one hand"". (Galaxi 8 leak reportedli indic a similar design for the same reasons.)S Matters: The high-end model are be rumor to have OLE screen of 5.1, 5.5, or 5.8-inches.Dress to Kill:Appl is experi with materials, so the next iPhon could have a glass front and back with aluminum chassis. But we also hear that Appl is experi with white ceram becaus it is more scratch-resist and durabl than steel.Hom Sweet Home: In choos the edge-to-edg OLE screen, Appl probabl ha to do away with the Home button, an indic that the touch ID will be replac with facial or retin scan technology.

At $44 billion in revenue, Amazon' intern segment is about half the size of it North American division. Over the last three years, intern growth ha also significantli lag growth in it home market, even when the effect of a stronger dollar are strip out. Dure those three years, Amazon ha also suffer a total oper loss abroad of more than $2.6 billion.Amazon ha been oper outsid North America for nearli 20 years, but even for a compani whose mantra is ""long-term,"" investor would be remiss if they didn't question whether the company' intern segment will ever gener profits.A tough nut to crackWhil plenti of American compani have found success and billion in profit abroad, includ tech giant likeAppleandAlphabet, it' been tougher go for retailers.Targetrec abandon it Canadian operations; sever retailers, includingHom Depot,hav pull out of China, and evenWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) , with subsidiari in major intern market like the UK, China, Brazil, and Mexico, ha struggl at time to replic it success at home as oper margin are thinner outsid the US.

It ha over 100 such warehous in the US, which have allow it to offer servic like Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, but match that densiti abroad won't be easy. The company' competit advantag often lie in the fast deliveri that it Prime membership program offers, which help explain whi it' profit in North America but not internationally.Amazon ha step up it focu on foreign markets. After lose out toAlibabain China, the compani ha pledg $5 billion in invest in India, challeng local compani like Flipkart and Snapdeal, as well as Alibaba. It also recent made Prime Video global, offer rock-bottom price in market like India and undercuttingNetflixin the process. However, in the vast major of those countri where it video stream servic is now offered, the two-day deliveri that American associ with Prime is not available.Wil the Souq deal pay off?Buy the biggest e-commerc compani in the Middl East seem like a smart move, and will certainli acceler Amazon' growth in that corner of the world. But investor need to be mind that Amazon is in a much earlier stage of develop abroad than it is in the US. The compani is still make invest to drive growth, and seem less concern with profits. While Prime ha reach a penetr rate of about 50% of US households, that rate is much lower overseas.It' unclear at thi point if Amazon will ever be consist profit in the intern segment. A weaker dollar would help, but the compani also face a number of challeng uniqu to the intern market includ infrastructure, differ cultur and regulations, and local competition.With Souq join it portfolio, expect Amazon' intern revenu growth to continue, but profit will like remain absent for the forese future, as the company' scale oversea is still far from what it is at home.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Platoon test is a concept in which sever truck drive togeth in a tight formation, with the pack be control by the lead truck at the head of the format and the rest be driven autonomously.Thi would allow the fleet to enhanc fuel effici by 15% thank to lower wind resistance. What' more, the autonom capabl of the follow in the pack would drive down labor cost and also address driver shortages. The benefit of the platoon concept are encourag state like Arkansas, Iowa, South Carolina, and California to modifi drive law to allow for testing.In Lo Angeles, for instance, earlier thi month, three Volvo truck were test on a busi freeway. The truck were just 50 feet apart from each other, with comput control the pedal function on two of them. Thi indic that seriou effort are be made to prove that autonomi can exist in self-driv trucks.NVIDIA' technolog can go a long way in enhanc autonom trucks, as it DRIVE PX 2 platform is base on artifici intellig and deep learning. The platform' deep neural network allow the camera and sensor on autonom vehicl to process data in real time, which enabl the vehicl to locat itself on a high-definit map and judg the path ahead.Thi mean that NVIDIA' self-driv platform teach itself to drive use real-world inputs, so it stand to gain a lot from test on both close and open roads.

The e-commerc giant' plan for the patent are not yet clear, but gradual move toward autom the deliveri process provid a hint that Amazon might consid develop or deploy self-driv trucks.Amazon need to reduc outbound ship costs, which have gone through the roof in recent years. The use of autonom truck to lower driver-rel cost and improv fuel effici will provid a tool to curtail these expenses. In the past, Amazon ha purchas truck trailer to exert greater control over it fulfil process and expedit deliveri between warehouses. So, it won't be surpris if it consid buy PACCAR truck power by NVIDIA technolog in the future.Thi could be anoth catalystNVIDIA is definit not the first mover in develop autonom truck technology.Volvo(NASDAQOTH: VOLVY) , for example, ha taken big step in thi area by demonstr that it self-driv truck can drive indemand areassuch as underground mines.

Will This Overlooked Cloud Stock Grow 60% by 2018?;4/1/2017;"Share of cloud storag providerBox(NYSE: BOX) ralli 35% over the past 12 months, but the stock hover just 18% abov it IPO price of $14. That' becaus after hit $23 on it first trade day in Jan. 2015, Box plung below $10 last Februari befor gradual recov to the mid-teens.Despit that lacklust performance, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White recent reiter hi ""Buy"" rate on the stock and hi price target of $26 -- which repres a near-60% ralli from it current price. White claim that Box look cheap with an EV/Sal ratio of 3.3 base on it calendar 2018 (fiscal 2019) expectations. Is that ""low"" valuat enough to justifi buy Box, or should investor ignor thi overlook cloud stock?Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();What are Box' key strengths?Box provid cloud storag and associ servic to over 71,000 businesses, includ the major of the Fortun 500 companies. It major custom includ industri behemothGener Electricand pharmaceut giantAstraZeneca. That market presenc is impressive, sinc the cloud storag market is fill with bigger player likeAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN),Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) 's Google.Despit those challenges, Box ha post double-digit sale growth ever sinc it IPO. It revenu rose 32% to $398.6 million in fiscal 2017, and it expect anoth 25%-26% growth thi year. Much of that growth come from the addit of new customers, the introduct of add-on cloud servic (like secur and analytics) which boost it revenu per customer, and integr partnership with compani like Microsoft,Salesforce, andIBM. Defer revenue, a key indic of forward demand, rose 30% to $242 million at the end of fiscal 2017.What are Box' key weaknesses?Lik mani high-growth tech companies, Box' robust revenu growth doesn't trickl down to ani profits. However, it non-GAAP loss narrow from $1.16 per share in 2016 to $0.56. Dure that period, it GAAP loss narrow from $1.67 to $1.19. That GAAP loss wa heavili weigh down by stock-bas compens expenses, which gobbl up 20% of Box' revenu dure the year.Wal Street expect Box to report non-GAAP loss thi yearandnext year -- although those loss are expect to continu narrowing. Box face a dilemma which mani cloud Saa (softwar as a service) compani face -- competit keep price expect low, but the cost of secur new custom and develop new servic remain high. We can clearli see that impact in it oper margins:Source:YChartsTh ongo cloud storag price war between Amazon, Microsoft, and Googl limit Box' abil to rais prices. However, all three compani can afford to use cloud storag servic as a loss leader to expand their ecosystems. Box ha neither the scale nor ecosystem to follow suit -- so it could eventu lose custom to those tech giants' bundl strategies.Box finish 2017 with a neg free cash flow (FCF) of $24.8 million. That mark a big improv from it neg FCF of $116.3 million in 2016, and Box achiev it first quarter of posit free cash flow ($10.2 million) dure the fourth quarter. However, Box isn't expect to achiev a full-year posit FCF anytim soon, and a neg FCF could prevent Box from scale up to widen it moat against bigger challengers.What do the valuat say?Drexel Hamilton' bullish view on Box is base on the notion that an EV/Sal ratio of 3.3 is cheap for a compani with it growth figures. For example, two other high-growth cloud servic stock withcompar sale growth--TwilioandVeeva-- have respect EV/Sal ratio of 4.6 and 8.2 base on next year' project revenues. It' also lower than the current industri averag of 4.8 for applic softwar makers.Assum that Box is ""fairli valued"" with an EV/Sal ratio between Twilio and Veeva's, it' certainlypossiblethat Box could rise to White' price target of $26. However, what bother me about that estim is that it' base on a long-rang forecast, and a lot can chang in the cloud storag industri within two years. If Amazon, Microsoft, and Googl continu slash price and pile on more features, Box could struggl to retain it top customers.Th key takeawayI think Box ha solid sale growth, and it grow list of big enterpris custom indic that it ha a lot of stay power. It also did a great job at ad more servic and partnerships, narrow it losses, and achiev posit free cash flow last quarter.However, claim Box can rise 60% base on next year' sale estim is a bit too optimistic. It' hard to tell how much storag price will fall over the follow year, and Box CEO Aaron Levi even onc admit that cloud storag would like be ""free and infinite"" in the future. Therefore, investor should temper their expect for Box base on futur develop across the cloud market.10 stock we like better than BoxWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Both want to increas the use of their store for pickup of onlin orders, returns, and, in mani cases, as ship point to facilit faster delivery.makeArticleAd();Neith chain face an easi road and both bump up against the giant shadow ofAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Thi is a long-term battl that won't play out quickly, but one of them seem to have an edge.Imag source:YCharts.Th case for TargetTarget stock ha been go in the wrong direct for the past few months. That fall wa caus by the company' disappoint holiday sale numbers, with same-stor sale slump by 1.5%. That overshadow news in the chain'sQ4 earn reportthat compar digit sale rose by 34% and store traffic wa actual up slightli (0.2%).A with most retail that turn in disappoint holiday sales, Target' stock price also tumbled. In my opinion, investor were more worri about the long-term prospect for physic retailers, though, than about Target' numbers.Go forward, however, the chain ha what it call it ""ambiti store redesign to date"" in apress release, which quot remark CEO Brian Cornel made at the recent ShopTalk show in La Vegas.""With our next gener of store design, we'r invest to take the Target shop experi to the next level by offer more elev product present and a number of time-sav features,"" said Cornell. ""The new design for thi Houston store will provid the vision for the 500 reimagin store plan for 2018 and 2019, with the goal of take a custom approach to creat an enhanc shop experience.""Th new store will featur two entrances. One will be optim to serv onlin custom pick up order or make return as well as peopl look to quickli buy item for immedi use. The second will focu on fashion and exclus Target lines.It' a bold chang design to embrac the idea that custom still need store for some thing -- buy a snack onlin is not use if you are hungri now, for exampl -- but want to see digit and physic experi that complement one another. As part of it transformation, Target is also open smaller-format store in citi market where it full-siz locat were impractical.Wall-Mart ha been grow it ship capacity. Imag source: Wal-Mart.Th case for Wal-MartWal-Mart is do mani of the same thing as Target to make it store support it digit sales. It ha gone a step further, however, in grow it onlin oper by spend $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com and then put it CEO, Marc Lore, in charg of it entir digit operation.That' a bold step, one that bring a differ type of think to a tradit company. Lore ha alreadi shaken thing up by elimin Wal-Mart' $50 program that offer unlimit two-day ship as an answer to Amazon Prime. Lore saw Amazon' lead and chang the program to offer free two-day ship on ani order of elig item over $35.It' too earli to know how that chang will work, but Wal-Mart did post U.S. e-commerc growth of 29% in Q4. CEO Doug McMillion spoke abut those effort in the company'searn release. ""We'r move with speed to becom more of a digit enterpris and better serv customers,"" he said.Which is the better buy?Whil Target may also be successful, Lore' presenc give Wal-Mart, alreadi the No. 2 onlin retail in the U.S., an edge. Take on Amazon is not easi for ani company, but Wal-Mart' low price and differenti custom base give it a better chance.In a difficult retail market, both retail are make smart move to adapt to chang consum behavior. Target and Wal-Mart understand that store will have to be integr into the digit experi for returns, pickups, and shipping. Exactli how well that will work remain to be seen.Wal-Mart ha been the bolder of the two compani and that' what' need to take on a rival like Amazon. Target' place -- and you can see it embrac it with the plan to go into citi market with smaller store and it effort to offer hip, exclus fashion line -- is to serv a more nich role. That may result in a solid business, but Wal-Mart' go after a bigger potenti audienc and Lore appear to be the one to help the compani reach it.10 stock we like better than TargetWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While most larg retail are base in thrive cities, Wal-Mart still call Bentonville, Arkansa home, the corner of the world Founder Sam Walton hail from. The compani dress it employe in drab smocks, and it slogans, ""Alway low prices,"" and ""Save money. Live better,"" make no bone about it valu proposition. It' not here to impress you or wow you with it style or selection. It' here to sell you dirt cheap products, like $2 t-shirts, with the help of it economi of scale and global suppli chain.makeArticleAd();Oth low-pric rival have found way to stand for someth in addit to savings.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for tech innov and top-notch custom service.Target(NYSE: TGT) ha it ""cheap chic"" cach thank to partnership with brand like Lilli Pulitzer. And even warehous giantCostcoWholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is known for free sampl and it uniqu ""treasur hunt"" shop experience.Aft year of base it reput on low price and noth else, however, Wal-Mart may final be changing. Under CEO Doug McMillon, the compani ha rais wages, come out against an Arkansa anti-LGBT law, and focus more on clean store and fulli stock shelves, acknowledg that store image, and not just low prices, is an import driver of performance.Thos invest have cut into profits, but have also caus compar sale to increas nine quarter in a row, buck the broader trend in retail.Wal-Mart ha also been make invest in e-commerce, expand it groceri pickup program and offer free two-day ship on order of $35 or more.Imag source: Wal-Mart.Mor importantly, the compani ha been busi make acquisitions, buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion last summer, and ha made three smaller deal more recently, swallow up Shoebuy, Moosejaw, and Modcloth. It' not a surpris that Wal-Mart ha it checkbook out and ready. After year of neglect e-commerce, the compani ha fallen a distant second behind Amazon, and it' final recogn the need to scale up quickli in the onlin channel in order to compete.Th recent acquisit have been driven by Jet.com founder and current Wal-Mart chief of U.S. e-commerc Marc Lore, who want to bring the energi of a start-up to the retail behemoth. But build a wide-rang onlin presenc may be harder than simpli make a seri of bolt-on acquisitions.No school for coolEach one of those websit Wal-Mart bought ha it own set of loyal shopper differ from the typic Wal-Mart shopper. Jet, for instance, court young, urban, earli adopters. Moosejaw, an outdoor brand, sold to rock jock and other adventurers, and women' cloth site Modcloth wa a favorit among hipsters.Thos folk aren't a natur fit with Wal-Mart' stodgi brand, and some have been disappoint with the news. A number of ModCloth shopper took to social media to protest the deal. One comment said:I have to say I'm realli disappoint that ModCloth is now part of the Walmart family. I don't believ Walmart ha their workers' interest at heart and so I can sadli no longer purchas from ModCloth.But just as the deal reflect Wal-Mart' need to branch out, they are also a sign of how difficult it is for small e-commerc compani to make it in a cutthroat environ dictat by Amazon. Like the e-commerc leader, these onlin busi tend to have few, if any, profits. Accord toTh Wall Street Journal, ModCloth sold to Wal-Mart for less than the valu of the ventur capit and debt it had raised, a sign of the challeng the busi wa face go it alone.It' noth personalWal-Mart' strategi is noth new.

Even Ben & Jerry's, as crunchi a mainstream brand as ani other, eventu sold toUnilever.Th brouhaha over Wal-Mart' takeov will like fade, but manag shouldn't ignor the backlash, especi sinc Lore ha said that he will aim for more such acquisitions. Wal-Mart can help back oper like suppli chain and shipping, but the parent should also focu on refresh it own brand, as it reput as a corpor bulli becom a bigger liabil with everi new deal.

More impressively, AMD eclips the perform of 2009, when sever stock were claw back from 2008' devastation.What' particularli endear for both present stakehold and prospect buyer is that Advanc Micro Devic is not slow down. For 2017, AMD stock is up just shi of 30%. That' enough for a veri solid year for most people' portfolios.In fact, if it keep up thi work rate, AMD could challeng for yet anoth triple-digit return. That would make consecut triple-digit returns, someth that hasn't happen for AMD stock sinc 1982 and 1983.Although the prospect for a history-mak event is extrem entic for investors, we also have to rememb the risks. Advanc Micro Devic ha long play second-fiddl toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for a reason. It also gave a foothold for semiconductor rival likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Th question is, which AMD will show up thi time around?Mani Reason to Love AMD StockCertainly, I can respect the idea of Advanc Micro Devic pull off anoth upset.It' run high on momentum, and sometimes, that' all you realli need.But as InvestorPlac writer Tom Taulli asserts, other substant factor are work in favor of AMD stock.Th 7 Best Stock to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementHav a strong busi is all about people. And AMD ha apowerhous leadership, start from the top. At the helm is CEO Lisa Su, a phenomen execut who ha a doctorate' degre in electr engin from MIT. She ha also serv in high-level posit at renown firmsFreescal Semiconductor Ltd(NYSE:FSL) andIntern Busi Machin Corp. (NYSE:IBM).Along with great peopl are products. Historically, thi is one area that ha trip up AMD stock. Although, it' alway been cheaper in price compar to rival Intel' offerings, AMD semiconductor have wrestl with the qualiti stigma.Th compani hope to chang that with itsRyzen CPUseries. Imbu with the latest technolog firepower, it can legitim challeng Intel for the throne. True to it heritage, the AMD unit are price lower than the competition. As Su succinctli states, ""More performance, half the price.""Finally, the broader fundament are support of AMD stock. The suppli glut that gut the semiconductor industri is easing, facilit recoveri of left-for-dead tech firms.Don't Look Under the Hood!A great as the bullish argument for AMD stock is, I still have my doubts. No one doubt the abil of Advanc Micro Devices' CEO, but Su is a genius, not a miracl worker. In thi case, the problem is bigger than her or anyon else.Last time around, I mention that AMD stock ha shift from onest of distressto another. Thi assess wa base on the vener Altman Z-Score indicator. And although it' improv in thi department, AMD ha been distress for the past six consecut years.But the fine print is in which specif factor AMD is improving, and not improving. TheZ-Scorei aggreg from a list of five factors. By far, the largest improv is in the ratio between ""market valu of equity"" and ""book valu of total liabilities."" Although important, thi doesn't tell us much about compani performance.What' Drive the Increas in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock?What doe illumin perform are the Z-Score' earn and sale gener factors. For both metrics, AMD stock is still consid distressed. That like won't chang until the semiconductor firm can address the deep-seat problem that got it in troubl initially.A a small caveat, I do think that the recoveri in AMD stock is noth short of remarkable. It might have some leg to go a littl bit further. But to stake a major posit on the back of except poor fundamentals? I'm crazy, but I'm notthatcrazy.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace4 Tech Stock That Are Break Out (Or Will Soon)10 Stock You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Will Sell You a Galaxi S8The postAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.

6 Signs Amazon.com's Best Days Are Ahead;3/31/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ralli 330% over the past five year -- an incred run for a compani that wa alreadi the world' largest onlin retailer. But even after that great rally, which lift the company' enterpris valu to over $400 billion, Amazon doesn't seem to be slow down at all.Analyst expect Amazon' sale and earn to respect rise 22% and 47% thi year, which are incred growth figur for a 22-year-old company. Let' take a look at six of Amazon' key strengths, and whi they indic that the tech giant' best day could still be ahead of it.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();1. The unstopp Prime juggernautAmazon' biggest retail weapon is Prime, it $99-a-year premium plan which bundl togeth discounts, free ship options, access to Amazon Video and other digit services, and new deliveri program for food and pantri items. Major brick-and-mortar retail likeWal-Marthav struggl to match Prime' perks.Amazon doesn't disclos how mani Prime member it has, but research firm CIRP claim that it had 63 million U.S. member last June, a 43% jump from the prior year. It also estim that the averag Prime member spent $1,200 per year, compar to just $500 for non-members.2. It expand smart home ecosystemAmazon expand it Prime ecosystem into home with Kindl tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, and Echo smart speakers. Amazon sell mani of these devic at veri thin margins, but it doe so to boost sale of physic and digit product while lock user into the Prime ecosystem.Amazon' intent to domin smart home are clear. It Echo speaker alreadi help user reorder products, control smart home appliances, access stream media services, search for information, and even connect to newerFordvehicles. It Dash button and DRS-enabl applianc also autom the reorder of consum from Amazon -- which could eventu hurt supermarkets.3. The inevit autom of it logist chainAn ongo concern about Amazon is it abil to keep ship cost under control. Yet Amazon ha alreadi offer a clear long-term solut to the problem -- the autom of it logist chain.Amazon' Prime Air drone. Imag source: Amazon.In January,Th Seattl Timesreport that Amazon use 45,000 warehous robot at 20 fulfil center -- mark a 50% jump from a year earlier.CNNalso recent report that prepar a singl Amazon shipment requir just one minut of human labor, thank to robot and autom systems. On the deliveri front, Amazon ha been test out it Prime Air drone and Prime Air planes. All thi autom should caus it logist cost to declin over the long term.4. It abil to disrupt multipl industriesAmazon excel at disrupt multipl industri at the same time. It' chasingNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) and YouTub in stream video; hit grocers, superstores, and apparel retail with same-day deliveri services, privat brands, and brick-and-mortar stores; and challeng restaur deliveri leaderslikeGrubHub.Amazon might not be the market leader in these categories, but it' catch up by bundl the servic into it Prime memberships. Thi mean that the ongo growth of Amazon' moat is forc compani in adjac market to defend their businesses.5. Expand oversea and shutter weaker businessesAmazon ha also set it sight on high-growth e-commerc market like India and the Middl East. It invest billion of dollar into it Indian busi to challeng market leader Flipkart, and recent agre to buy Souq.com, the market leader in the highli fragment Middl Eastern e-commerc market.Lik Netflix, Amazon is releas origin video content for it oversea markets. But unlik Netflix, Amazon can leverag it Prime ecosystem to gain more viewer -- who will hope becom it loyal customers.6. Amazon Web Services' untouch lead in the cloudAmazon gener most of it revenu from it marketplac business, but most of it profit come from Amazon Web Servic (AWS), the biggest cloud platform in the world. AW achiev an annual run rate of $14 billion last quarter.Th unit' revenu rose 47% annual and account for 8% of Amazon' top line dure the quarter, but it oper incom rose 60% and account forov halfof it oper profits. The bottom line growth enabl Amazon to post consist profit -- which seem like a pipe dream just a few year ago. It also allow Amazon to use low-margin or loss-lead strategi to expand it Prime ecosystem.Th key takeawaysIprevi statedthat I plan to hold Amazon ""forever"", and I stick by that statement. There' no singl compani which match Amazon' presenc in e-commerc or cloud platforms, and it continu growth in both market could crush mani smaller competitor over the next few years. Therefore, take profit might seem prudent today, but I firmli believ that Amazon' best day are still ahead.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

More recently, they quietli own ""the cloud.""Yes, Amazon is highli valued, but that' onli a concern if the compani stop growing, which doesn't appear to be an issue.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dog;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAt the risk of sound like a broken record,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the most elit valu stock available. First, the obviou fact is that GOOGL stock own that littl thing call the internet. It may have beeninventedbi former Vice-presid Al Gore, but Alphabet took it to a whole new level. By logic deduction, an invest in Alphabet stock is an invest in digit - not a bad gig at all!makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh other reason whi GOOGL stock sit atop an extrem exclus club is consistency.Find me a compani that is as reliabl and ha as much potenti as Alphabet. The night is still young, but share have onli suffer three annual losses. Of those, onli one - in 2008 - regist in the doubl digits. The other down year in 2010 and 2014 averag loss of about 5%.On the plu side, from 2005 through the end of 2016, GOOGL stock is averag over 24%. Granted, not everi year is stellar. But if the end game is a long-term, steadi buffer for your portfolio, you can't go wrong with Alphabet stock. It probabl won't provid the firework of yesteryear, but thi is more of a slow burn. Sometimes, you have to have patienc for qualiti work.Still, I understand the concerns. Psycholog speaking, GOOGL stock ha a hefti price tag. Can investor reli upon it over the next ten to twenti years?Th Big Risk With Alphabet StockTh biggest fundament risk to GOOGL stock is the ""one-trick pony"" argument.10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashA InvestorPlac contributor Lawrenc Meyersexplains, ""Alphabet is the largest digit advertis billboard in the world, with about 88% of it revenu come from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock' growth ha been driven by thi spectacular seizur of internet territori from competitors. In fact, dure the financi crisis, ad revenu still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despit a worldwid ad revenu declin of 11% that year.""For now, GOOGL exercis unpreced dominance, and Alphabet stock is sure buoy by thi leverage. As Meyer further notes, ""[i]t could get hit with a 20% declin in total revenues, which would bring it roughli in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still gener net incom of $15 billion or so."" Ordinarily, a double-digit sale hit lead to automat hemorrhag in the markets. However, GOOGL stock could earn a reprieve.Th problem is what happen in the future? Will peopl continu toGoogleth on the internet? Or will there be some other innov brought forth by Silicon Valley? It seem ridicul to ask the question, but we'v seen thi trend before. Not too long ago, the scienc of instant (physical) photographi wa exclusivelyPolaroid' domain. Today, Polaroid is basic a shell company. Even the term ""instant photography"" isn't use much anymore.A great as Alphabet stock is, let' be real - thi is not a balanc investment. A paradigm shift in internet advertis can potenti toppl GOOGL.Mor Good Than Bad for GOOGLWhil I respect the risks, I'm confid that the posit far outweigh the neg for Alphabet stock. First off, the one-trick poni argument doesn't scare me as much becaus we'r not talk about commodit leverage.What is the internet? Mani might answer what they do on the internet, and quit frankly, I don't want to know. But all the respons you might receiv boil down to thi - it' the forum for the exchang of ideas. Idea never go out of style. Becaus of that one singl fact, I highli doubt that Alphabet will, either.Th internet ha evolved, and dramat so.What Al Gore invent decad ago metamorphos into it own, nearli self-awar entity. The true beauti of thi network is that it level the inform play field. No longer is data strictli limit to the hall of academia. Anybodi can propos a new idea, or an innovation, and thi can rapidli prolifer without the need for credentials.Yes, FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock Is for RealThat, my friends, is the power of GOOGL stock. Thi is a compani that will adapt and evolv to whatev challeng it faces. So long as they keep that corpor cultur intact, you'r not go to find a better valu play than Alphabet stock.GOOGL Stock: Competit Is Still BehindFor those that are worri about Alphabet' competition, I'd set those aside. Yes,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) can make some noise, andAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is alway up to something. These are compani that servic their sector like no other. Becaus of that, peopl use those servic base on their earn reputation.GOOGL ha the internet. That much is obviou becaus Googl is a verb. Other compani name invok a function. Wefriendeach other on Facebook. Webuystuff on Amazon. The commodit critic is more applic to them. Someon might invent a better way to network online. Anoth person might offer cheaper and faster e-retailing.But a better way to internet? Again, I highli doubt that anyon can compet with Alphabet. For better or for worse, they'v got their tentacl entrench into everyth web-related. So you can rest easi with GOOGL stock. Neither the compani nor the opportun is go anywher but up.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stock That Could Doubl in the Next 3 MonthsTh 7 Best Stock to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement3 Artifici Intellig Stock to Buy for Monster ProfitsTh postWhi Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dogappear first onInvestorPlace."
Wal-Mart's Free Shipping Is Probably Not a Threat to Amazon;3/31/2017;"After year of struggl to translat it brick-and-mortar success to the digit world,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) spent $3.3 billion last year to acquir e-commerc start-up Jet.com as well as the servic of it founder and CEO, Marc Lore, a serial e-commerc entrepreneur who found Quidsi, the Diapers.com parentAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) paid $545 million for six year ago. Lore wa immedi put in charg of Walmart.com, which he is run along with Jet.com. It wa a bold move by the retailer, a sort of self-disrupt design to inject start-up think into a matur brand.Lor act quickli and decis to counteract Amazon' major lead. Hi biggest move wa to elimin Wal-Mart' $50-a-year answer to Amazon Prime, ShippingPass. Instead of charg custom an annual fee for free two-day ship -- someth Prime member pay $99 a year for -- Wal-Mart' new digit boss made two-day ship free with ani qualifi order over $35.That wa a short-term profits-be-damn move that a start-up would make when take on a giant. It wa a direct shot at Amazon, an attempt to woo both uncommit custom and the estim 65 million Prime member in the Unit States, who are estim to spend an averag of $1,200 a year on Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();It' easi to see whi Wal-Mart want to win over Prime members, but after a month of give Walmart.com a chance, I'm pretti sure it' not go to work.Wal-Mart ha made some bold move to grow it onlin business. Imag source: Wal-Mart.A month with Walmart.comI have been a Prime member for mani years, close to as long as the program ha been offered. I don't order from Amazon everi day, but certainli a few time a week, and sometim more than onc in a singl day if a need pop up. I start buy physic book and CD from the retailer, and now buy everyth from electron to food, kitti litter, tea, variou household supplies, and much more.It' import to point out that Amazon doe not share data on how often Prime member order, but the compani ha made it veri easi to place single-item order that total less than $35. You can, for example, reorder your dish-wash liquid use an internet-connect Dash button that you can place near your sink. You can also order through the Alexa voic assist and place single-click order on your phone, or through a computer.It' a system that encourag buy what you need when you need it and that' where my experi use WalMart.com hit some major snags. My first order of the month wa an attempt to find a jar of smooth spaghetti sauce, as my 13-year-old son doe not like tomato chunk in hi sauce. Wal-Mart stock the brand I wanted, but the item wa under $10, so I place the order on Amazon.That pattern repeat throughout the month. I need earbuds, sticki notes, a tote bag for the beach, and variou other things, but never all at once, and never in a quantiti that total $35.In most cases, I did find the item I wanted, or a compar one, on WalMart.com. That actual surpris me becaus Amazon ha ""over 50 million elig items,"" accord to it web page while Wal-Mart' free two-day ship offer onli cover ""more than two million items,"" the compani said in a press release. Still, a good select did not matter when hit the $35 threshold would have requir planning, waiting, or buy thing I don't need.Prim is still the kingAmazon ha train me, and I would assum ten of million of other Prime members, that we can have pretti much whatev we want in two day no matter how small the order is. Have to attempt to hold off on ordering, or pad my order to get to $35 wa a complic that for me make the $99 Prime cost worth it.There' noth wrong with Wal-Mart' websit or app. Both rival Amazon for ease-of use. The one order I did place with the company, which I pad with a video game to reach the $35 threshold, came in two day as promis (albeit in three separ boxes) and wa no more difficult to place than a Prime order.Off free two-day ship on order over $35 compar to Amazon' Free 5-to-8-day ship on order over $25 will win Wal-Mart some customers. Those shoppers, however, will larg come from digit consum not yet loyal to Amazon, peopl who onli shop onlin occasionally, and cheapskat will to put up with inconveni to save a buck. It' not that Wal-Mart' deal is not attractive, it' simpli that in my experience, get to $35 in order to trigger the free ship prove much harder than expectedConsid thi a first move from Lore who appear to have the full back of Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. Free ship on order over $35 should measur move the needl for the company, just not at Amazon' expense.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Dispirit retail sale growth in Februari did littl to cheer such companies. Amid all these, onlin competit from the like of Amazon.com, Inc.

Thus, if you'r consid buy brick-and-mortar retailers, make sure you invest in the compani with a strong onlin presence. Lest we forget, retail stock should gain in the U.S. market over the next week and month after March' consum confid read steer past Wall Street consensus.Hav Brick-and-Mortar Retail Lost Their Charm?Brick-and-Mortars, recently, are battl some seriou bottlenecks. The market is oversatur with too much squar footag capac be ad sinc the earli 2000s. Thousand of door have opened, with U.S. have six time more retail space than Europ and Japan.

Such a develop is give nightmar to brick-and-mortar store as they fail to offer the endless select that onlin player can.

5 “Dead Money” Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid;3/31/2017;"By Brett OwensTh S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat are a group of stock belov as ""widows-and-orphans"" invest - can't-miss compani whose stabil and rock-solid dividend will keep you into old age and will exist long after you'v passed. It' a reassur thought, but ultimately, it' an illusion. Like the broader S&P 500 and the stock market as a whole, some of it member are good investments, and some - includ five loser I plan on highlight today - are not.I love the term ""dividend aristocrat"" ... but onli becaus it' more honest than most peopl realize. The word ""aristocrat"" can refer to peopl who are mani things, includ superior, better able, smarter and wiser. That' fair. Mani dividend aristocrat truli are among the best compani in the world, and the best steward of your invest money.But there' also a good reason we all cring a littl at the word ""aristocracy."" Mari Antoinett lost her head becaus the aristocraci - ""elite"" as it might have been - wasn't particularli good about address the need of the people.makeArticleAd();That' the problem with sever dividend aristocrats.Consid this: Compani A meet all the criteria for S&P 500 dividend aristocracy, includ hike it dividend 10%, mayb 15% everi year - more incom in your pocket, and a like sign that the busi is ampli growing. Compani B meet all the criteria for inclusion, includ hike it dividend 0.5%, mayb 1% everi year - literallyshortchang you by not even keep up with inflation, and a like sign that the busi ha flatlined.Both compani would still be dividend aristocrats.Investor also tend to forget that dividend aristocraci isn't eternal.Pitney Bow (PBI)wa drop from the club in 2013 after the compani halv it quarterli payout, from 37.5 cent to 18.75 cents. Letthoseinvestor eat cake.Membership today doesn't guarante dividend in perpetuity, and it certainli doesn't guarante a strong investment. So today, I want to highlight five wide held S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat that have hike their dividend for decad ... but ultim will be dead money that hold your portfolio back becaus the stock market is all about futur (rather than past) performance.Wal-Mart (WMT)Dividend Yield:2.9%Big-box retailerWal-Mart (WMT)ha warn custom about fall price for decad ... but all the while grace investor with rise dividends. In fact, back in February, WMT up the ant on it payout to reach a 44th consecut year of dividend increases.That' the good news.Th bad news? For one, that dividend hike wa a mere 2%, from $2 per share annual to $2.04, or 51 cent quarterly. Worse, payout increas have hover around 2% for the past four years, with WMT chip in a mere penni per share extra annual sinc 2014.The world' largest retail is never go away - not as long as the middl class continu to shrink and there' an abund of consum who need low-cost goods. But competit withAmazon (AMZN)online,Target (TGT)on the brick-and-mortar high ground andDollar Gener (DG)andDollar Tree (DLTR)on the brick-and-mortar low groundha strangl Walmart' growth prospects.Avoid Walmart. It middl yield won't compens for stagnant prices.Walmart' (WMT) Dividend Growth Ha Slow to a CrawlMcDonald' (MCD)Dividend Yield:2.9%Speak of growth woes, let' look at anoth popular low-cost name:McDonald' (MCD).Yes, thi is the same McDonald' that' trade at all-tim high right now. And to it credit, McDonald' alway seem to have some sort of ""second act"" that reviv faith in the company, whether it' fight off health critic with wrap and salads, or emphas a strength by offer all-day breakfast.But the perform in MCD doesn't reflect reality.Revenu peak in 2013 and have declin everi year since, includ a $24.6 billion top line in 2016 that wa 12% lower than it wa three year ago. While net incom rebound a bit to $4.7 billion, that' still 16% off 2013 levels.McDonald' most recent dividend increas - in 2016, it 40th consecut year - wa more robust than Wal-Mart's, but at 5.6%, it wa hardli generous. Combin that with a mediocr yield, a forward P/E that' more expens than the market and revenu that are expect to declin by doubl digit thi year and next, and I have to wonder: What' the point?McDonald' (MCD) Oper Are Stuck in LimboDuk Energi (DUK)Dividend Yield:4.1%At least with utilities, you know you'r not get much in the way of growth. These play are all about dividend and stability, and on those two fronts,Duk Energi (DUK)do a decent enough job of delivery.But that' about the best thing I can say about Duke right now.For one, while mani peopl believ a great coal renaiss is nigh,I disagree. Util compani are ditch coal-fir plant left and right, replac them with natur ga plants, which are cleaner but costlier. While Presid Donald Trump will tri to reviv coal, I think it' past saving, and that put a cap on DUK share go forward.But more simply, DUK is too expens and too chintzy. The stock trade at nearli 27 time earnings, which isn't just high on it own - it' high historically, too. And while the compani celebr it 90th consecut dividend increas last July, that came in at a token 3.6% ... nudg it five-year compound averag dividend growth higher to just 2.7%.Duke Energi (DUK) Is Too Expens for Low Growth, Low Dividend GrowthKimberly-Clark (KMB)Dividend Yield:2.9%Kimberly-Clark (KMB)i one of sever low-growth dividend aristocrat from the consum stapl sector that investor pile into for safeti and reason yields.Th rational is fine: No matter how bad thing get, peopl are still go to need Huggi diapers, Kleenex tissu and Cottonel toilet paper - and that provid Kimberly-Clark with some natur defens dure market downturns. So doe KMB' dividend increas streak of 45 consecut years, which give investor the warm fuzzies.Lik McDonald's, Kimberly-Clark is trade near all-tim highs. And like MCD shareholders, KMB bull seem to be ignor a downtrend on the top line for the past few years, and the fact that Wall Street onli see margin growth in the year ahead.Meanwhile, Kimberly-Clark' dividend increas have slow to 4%-5% over the past few years, and the stock' P/E ha balloon back to abov 20.Toilet paper and a 3% yield won't be abl to push KMB much farther from here.Kimberly-Clark (KMB) Will Face Realiti at Some PointCoca-Cola (KO)Dividend Yield:3.5%Last, we look atCoca-Cola (KO), which ha improv it quarterli payout for 55 consecut years.Simpli put, Coca-Cola is in trouble. While the eponym Coca-Cola brand is never go away completely, and while KO ha diversifi into other drink types, American (and increasingly, the rest of the world) are turn away from sugari drink - and that' dire news for Coke.In 2015, soda consumpt suffer it 11th consecut annual declin and fell to a 30-year low. While 2016 figur aren't yet out, we do know that last year, American bottl water consumpt surpass carbon soft drink for the first time. Thing don't look to improv go forward, with citi increasingli grappl with the idea of soda tax to boost govern coffers.Coca-Cola is increasingli feel the weight - revenu are mire in a multiyear slump, and share trade essenti where they did four year ago. Meanwhile, dividend growth ha slow to less than 6% as of KO' last payout hike. And yet somehow, share still trade for nearli 22 time next year' earnings!Thi dividend aristocrat isn't dead by ani means, but it' certainli dead money.Coca-Cola (KO) Is Go the Wrong Way!Th Retir Portfolio You NEVER Have to Touch!On of the cruelest ironi I'v come across is how mani retir portfolio hold these and other dividend aristocrat that will weigh down their nest eggs, but how few of them hold the type of big-yielding, dividend-grow dynamo that are found in my""No Withdrawal"" retir portfolio.Too mani investor are sucker into buy big-nam large-cap blue chip that boast safeti on the promis of ""big"" yield ... of 3%, mayb 4% if you'r lucky. But these stock often start to rot in your portfolio with dividend increas that don't even keep up with inflation, and tini capit gain becaus they'v given up on growth a long, long time ago.And remember, if you'r earn just 3% to 4%, that mean you'r bring annual retir incom of just $30,000, mayb $40,000 a year. You and I both know how far you'll get on that:Not far. Not farat all.That' whi I'v buri my head in the book to compil a""No Withdrawal"" retir portfolio- a set of buy-and-hold dividend stock pick that gener yield of 6%, 7%, 8% ... even a coupl in the doubl digits, but also offer 7% to 15% upsid in annual capit gains. That meansyou can live off dividend incom alon without ever touch your nest egg- but if disast strike and you need to dip in, that' OK, becaus you'v grown your retir account with these double-whammi dynamos.What make thi portfolio so effect is that it' an all-star makeup - rather than focus on just one area of the market, it' the best of the best prefer stocks, REITs, closed-end fund and more. That mean diversif and continu payout against the most volatil of markets.Don't spend your retir hope you can just get by on meager blue-chip return and your Social Secur checks. Collect big, regular dividend check instead that will let you pay the bills, financ your vacat and even spoil your family.Thi is the path to the worry-fre retir you deserve.Click here and I'll provid you with THREE special report that show you the path to build a ""No Withdrawal"" portfolio.

Is Amazon Following Microsoft's Lead in Augmented Reality?;3/31/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) could be develop augment realiti (or AR) featur for it own chain of homewar stores, accord toTh New York Times. The report, which cite a sourc ""brief in the discussions,"" indic that shopper at Amazon' brick-and-mortar homewar store could use devic or app to ""project"" home furnish into digit imag of their actual live rooms.Thi idea isn't realli new. Back in 2013,IKEAlaunch an AR app which let custom project furnitur into their live room via a smartphon camera. Last year, home improv retailerLowe's(NYSE: LOW) installedMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) HoloLen mix realiti headset at select store to let shopper design virtual rooms.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();However, Amazon' AR plan coincid with it recent move into the brick-and-mortar space with test bookstores, groceri stores, and now rumor homewar stores. Let' see what that push mean for Amazon, and how it could boost demand for Microsoft' HoloLen and holograph apps.What is Amazon up to?Amazon' brick-and-mortar expans might seem counterproductive, sinc it onlin marketplac is forc mani brick-and-mortar retail to shutter store and invest more heavili in e-commerce. However,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ha proven that some custom still prefer place order onlin and pick them up immedi to avoid wait time and ship fees.To cut overhead costs, Amazon' groceri store model use a ""just walk out"" system call Amazon Go. The store track the item taken by the custom and charg their Amazon account onc they walk out -- elimin the need for checkout line and cashiers. It bookstor offer special discount to Prime members, and offer self-checkout via the Amazon app.For the rumor homewar push, the idea will like be the same -- to offer self-checkout for smaller items, deliveri for larger items, and discount for Prime members. Assum that you have pictur of your live room, you can potenti project the home furnish into your home like the IKEA app.Sinc these brick-and-mortar store all give preferenti treatment to Prime members, that expans can boost the growth of the Prime ecosystem. Last June, research firm CIRP estim that Amazon had 63 million Prime member in the U.S., a 19 million increas from a year earlier. It also estim that the averag Prime member spent $1,200 annual at Amazon, while non-memb spent just $500.Make sens of Amazon' AR investmentsThi isn't Amazon' first move into the AR market. However, it previou move have been all over the map. In late 2015, it patent an AR project system, similar to Microsoft' IllumiRoom, which ""transformed"" live room into complet different, interact environments. For example, a user could theoret tap the wall and turn it into a TV screen, or tap the desk to open an e-book.Last year, Amazon offer job for a virtual realiti team. It didn't say much about the team' goals, except that it would focu on a platform for ""immers storytelling"". Analyst and investor specul that Amazon could appli VR to game on the Fire TV, or add VR view option to Amazon Video. However, the recent report about AR homewar indic that the team might actual be develop new AR featur for the Amazon app to enhanc the shop experi at it brick-and-mortar stores.What doe thi mean for Microsoft and the AR market?Amazon' rumor AR app or homewar store might never see the light of day, sinc the compani hasn't publicli said anyth about them yet. But Amazon' interest might get other retail interest in use AR tool in brick-and-mortar stores.A HoloLen demo at Lowe's. Imag source: Lowe's.That would be great news for Microsoft, sinc the HoloLen is the most matur ""mix reality"" headset today. The upcom Window 10 Creator Update, which will add easy-to-us holograph tool for developers, could also make it much easier for retail to build custom app for the HoloLen without Microsoft' help. Thi wouldn't onli appli to big box retail like Lowe' --Volvoi also use the HoloLen in dealership to let custom virtual view car which aren't in stock.I augment realiti the next big thing?It' hard to tell if Amazon and Microsoft' earli AR move into the retail space will ignit a major shift in how store showcas their products. However, tech M&A advisori firm Digi-Capit estim that the AR market will grow from nearli noth today to $90 billion by 2020, with much of that growth gener by sale of AR hardware, e-commerc uses, and enterpris applications.If compani like Amazon and Microsoft lead thi charge, we could see mainstream interest in AR evolv beyond earli effort like Googl Glass andPokemon Gotoward shop apps. That shift could blur the line between ""showrooming"" and onlin purchases, which could help tech giant like Amazon straddl both markets.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks for 2017: General Motors Corporation (GM) Stock Off to a Slow Start;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsEditor' note: Thi column is part of ourBest Stock for 2017contest. Charl Sizemore' pick for the contest isGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM).makeArticleAd();Well, it would seem I'm off to a slow start inInvestorPlace'sBest Stock for 2017 contest. As I'm write this, my pick -Gener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) - in seventh place with a return of exactlyzerofor the year. That' a poor show for GM stock, given that theS&P 500i up over 5% for the year while the current leader in thi year' contest - Adam Johnson' pickZynerba Pharmaceut Inc(NASDAQ:ZYNE) - is up a whop 36%.That' OK. I'v been here before. Around thi time last year, I wa in dead last place and down an embarrass 70%. And yetI finish the year just fine, thank you veri much.I can't promis that Gener Motor will mount an equal impress comeback. But Icanpromis you this. It' still veri earli in 2017, and a lot will happen between now and Dec. 31.How GM Stock is FaringSo, whi is GM' engin sputtering? After all, American auto sale are near post-crisi highs. And 2016 wa actual a record year.Look ahead, lower crude oil price - and a new presidenti administr that is friendlier to fossil fuel - promis to tilt Gener Motors' sale mix toward it more profit (yet far more gas-thirsty) light truck and SUVs.A rise tide lift all boats, and Gener Motor revenu have been trend steepli higher for the past two years. Seriously, what is there not to like here?Wal Street fear that today' high auto sale are unsustainable, driven in part by low interest rate that encourag irrespons borrow by consum who have bitten off more than they can chew.Th 7 Best Stock to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementAnd there is certainli some truth to this. In 2016, a record number of U.S. vehicl trade-in - nearli a third -had outstand loan larger than the valu of the car, mean that the balanc from the old car get roll into the loan for the new car. It' not surpris that the kind of person that would tack auto debt on top of auto debt would also have a hard time pay the bills, and auto loan delinqu are rising, particularli among subprim borrowers.Furthermore, both GM stock andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) have told their investor to expect softer sale growth thi year.I get all of that. I realli do. But consid that GM and Ford trade for 6 and 7 time their respect expect 2017 earnings, you can't say that there is a lot of optim built into current prices. In fact, those are close to ""go out of business"" prices.At today' valuations, automak don't actual need to have a banner year. Anyth short of disast should send share price sharpli higher.Ag Car Benefit Gener MotorsI also expect auto sale to be a lot less cyclic thi cycle. As I mention in myorigin write-up on GM stock, the age of the averag car on American road is now 12 years. That' not the averag age befor a car goe to the scrap heap … it' the age of carsstil on the road.Th shock of the 2008 crisi and aftermath left a gape hole in auto sale that the strong perform of recent year ha onli partial filled. American have been hold on to their car for longer, and frankly, that trend can't last forever. Demand for replac vehicl should prevent the next downturn in auto sale from be as sever as the last few downturns.But let' chang gear for a moment and return to GM' valuation. I mention that Gener Motor trade at a ridicul 6 time expect 2017 earnings, but that' not the onli metric by which it look ridicul cheap. GM stock also trade for 0.32 time sale and at a dividend yield of 4.3%.And speak of the dividend, GM ha done a solid job of rais it ever sinc it wa reinstat in 2014.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could RetreatGener Motor ha rais it quarterli dividend from 30 cent per share to 38 cents. And given that GM onli pay out 25% of it profit as dividends, there is still room for growth, even if the bear are correct and GM hit a rough patch.Wil GM take the crown in thi year' Best Stock contest? Well, that' for Mr. Market to decide. But I'm veri content to hold GM and collect the high and grow dividend for month or even year while wait for Mr. Market to come around.Charl Sizemore, CFA is the princip ofSizemor Capital.

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Home Depot Inc;3/30/2017;"You may have heard that the retail industri is in tatters.For the vast major of brick-and-mortar chains, that' true. Depart store are shed profit as fewer custom visit their local mall. Apparel compani are struggl as they face increas competit from e-commerc oper likeAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and fast-fashion chain like H&M, and bankruptci have hit a rang of sector from sport good to apparel to electronics.Imag source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();But one corner of retail ha stood out as a winner even as much of the industri crumbl around it. Led byHom Depot(NYSE: HD) , the home-improv sector continu to grow as sale have increas 5.9% over the last three months, accord to the Censu Bureau, better than almost ani other retail segment.Her are three reason whi the best is still to come for Home Depot.1. It' Amazon-proofAlmost across the board, retail have seen their busi pressur by Amazon. From book to electron to clothes, each time Amazon ha enter a new category, brick-and-mortar busi have suffered. But the e-commerc giant ha larg avoid the home-improv segment, and it' easi to see why. With heavi and larg product like drywall, 2x4s, and windows, it' not a categori that lend itself to delivery. Do so would be ineffici as similarli price item in other categori are usual much smaller.Though Amazon ha been increasingli experi with physic retail formats, the compani seem focus on books, gadgets, and groceries, which should occupi it brick-and-mortar strategi for the forese future. Other storefront busi like restaur have seen an indirect effect from Amazon as spillov retail traffic ha fallen, but Home Depot, with an averag transact of around $60, is a destin in and of itself and not depend on shopper who are brows in malls, the way restaur are.2. The hous market is get strongerHom Depot stock ha soar sinc the recession, up more than 700% sinc the market' bottom in 2009. The hous market ha steadili recov over that time, and home price are now at record high again. Similarly, exist home sale hit a 10-year high in January, and other figur also show an expand hous market.Whil there is some concern about anoth bubble, consum and small busi confid are at post-recess highs, and there is plenti of slack in the labor market from peopl who stop look for jobs, despit figur that show the countri is near full employment. A business-friendli administr in the White Hous with plan to invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructur could also help. Rise interest rate may eventu cool the hous market, but the Feder Reserv ha thu far been restrain in rais rates.Finally, Home Depot and rivalLowe's(NYSE: LOW) own figures, along with data from the Censu Bureaushow increas invest in home improvement, and other trend have shown that millenni tend to spend more money on kitchen and bathroom remodels.3. Smart managementOv the last decade, Home Depot ha made a number of wise decisions, avoid pitfal that have hurt other retailers. In 2012, the compani pull out of China, shutter seven store after come to the conclus that the do-it-yourself etho that drive busi in the U. wasn't a cultur fit in the world' No. 2 economy.Manag ha also shown similar restraint at home. Unlik most retail giants, it ha refus to open new store sinc 2008, with it store count remain at 2,274, all of them in America, Canada and Mexico.With nearli 2,000 store in the U.S., the compani alreadi ha a store within 10 mile of most Americans, and rightli believ that open new store would cannib exist ones. Instead, it invest in e-commerce, store improvements, and return capit to shareholders.A a return, manag ha steadili knock down the growth goal it ha set. The compani seem well on it way to hit it goal for next year, announc in 2015, includ revenu of $101 billion, repres a compound annual sale growth rate of 4.7%, oper margin go from 13% to 14.5%, and return on invest capit jump from 27% to 35%.A the hous market expand and Home Depot approach those numbers, the stock should onli move higher.10 stock we like better than Home DepotWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When it come to onlin sales, it' still well behindAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Wal-Mart, though, is spend heavili to catch up, acquir Jet.com and sever other e-commerc websit over the past year.But for all Wal-Mart' efforts, Amazon is still widen the gap.

As Amazon and other e-commerc site start eat into more tradit brick-and-mortar retail segments, Wal-Mart investor may have someth to worri about.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Wal-MartWal-Mart' e-commerc spend is go off the chartsWal-Mart made big headlin when it announc the acquisit of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. Few peopl paid attent to the streak of acquisit Wal-Mart and Jet have made sinc then. Jet.com acquir Hayneedl just befor the deal with Wal-Mart closed. Under Wal-Mart it acquir ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, and ModCloth.What' more, Wal-Mart' head of e-commerc in the U.S., Marc Lore, said it' ""a fair assumption"" that Jet and Wal-Mart will pursu more of these type of acquisitions.Wal-Mart is also invest in build out it own technology. It' creat a start-up incub call Store No. 8 to build new technolog to enhanc the custom experi both in store and online. The compani didn't disclos how much it plan to pour into the project.Wal-Mart doesn't have an R&D expens on it incom statement, but if it did, it'd sure be rocket higher. Still, it ha to compet with the $16 billion Amazon spent on technolog and content last year. (Some of that spend goe to support Amazon Web Services, Amazon' cloud-comput division, as well as Prime Instant Video). Wal-Mart may have the resourc to spend that much, but there' one big concern Wal-Mart investor should have.Nobodi can compet with AmazonAmazon ha a huge moat call Amazon Prime. Amazon like hasov 70 million Prime subscribers, and the first place they go when they want to buy someth onlin is Amazon.com.Wal-Mart tri to compet with Amazon Prime by offer it own ship servic -- ShippingPass. Earlier thi year it end the $49 per year program and start offer free two-day ship to everyon for over 2 million item on it websit (on order $35 or more). That won't show up in R&D either, but it'll like hit Wal-Mart' oper margin.Th bigger problem, though, is that Amazon is at the top of mind for consum shop online. More than half of onlin shopper start their product search on Amazon.com. Wal-Mart can piec togeth a bunch of web properti with a few million in sale each, but it won't cut into Amazon' huge dedic custom base.So Wal-Mart may be spend heavili to grow it e-commerc through acquisit and a new start-up incubator, but there' no indic that ani of it effort will produc result for the compani -- especi consid the premium it' pay for all these rel small web stores.Again, e-commerc is the main drive forc behind retail growth in the U.S. If Wal-Mart' onli mean of grow it onlin sale is through expens acquisitions, that should concern investors.

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Retreat;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' hard to findAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) bear most days, especi when the stock is continu reset all-tim highs. Less than 2% of Amazon' float is sold short, mean even at these heights, veri few bear are will to bet against AMZN stock.makeArticleAd();Yet, here and there, contrarian get the best of Amazon, which ha been prone to the occasion sharp setback amid it multiyear race through the stratosphere. The start of 2016 saw Amazon share pull back by more than 25% in about a month-and-a-half, and AMZN yield about 15% of ground between mid-Octob and mid-Novemb of last year.In fact, even I'm a long-term bull on Amazon, but I'm also cautiou - it pay to be. So right now, I'm pay attent to three near-term headwind that could keep Amazon stock from push to even higher prices, and could make AMZN stock a good prospect for quick bearish option trades.Here' a look at three thing that could hold Amazon back over the next month or so:Headwind for AMZN StockA Recent Defeat:Amazon just announc yesterday that it' put the kibosh on Quidsi, the oper of six shop sites, foremost of which is Diapers.com. While AMZN isn't known for make big-ticket acquisitions, the Quidsi purchas in 2011 for $545 million still rank among the company' top five.Th 7 WORST Stock to Buy Right NowTh rationale?""W have work extrem hard for the past seven year to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortun we have not been abl to do so. Quidsi ha great brand expertis and they will continu to offer select on Amazon.com; the softwar develop team will focu on build technolog for AmazonFresh.""AMZN is known for test idea with the willing to accept failure, but there' someth to be said about that failurea.)com from an acquisit andb.)deal with the core busi of onlin retail.Quidsi ha an addit barb that could stick in Amazon' craw. Co-found and former CEO Marc Lore, who wa brought over to Amazon as part of the acquisition, left after a few year to found Jet.com … whichWal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT) bought out in 2016, give the big-box retail much more ammunit on the onlin front.Amazon Go Delays:Amazon had Wall Street and Main Street alik sing of the come death of other brick-and-mortar grocer in late Decemb when it announcedAmazon Go- a new store concept that would chang the way consum shopoffline.Th concept: Custom walk in and activ the Amazon Go app. They'r then free to walk about the building, shop as they like, and leav without check out. Instead, it use sensor and other technolog to determin what you'v bought, and it charg you accordingly.Thi announc drove a lot of excit in AMZN stock, but the compani recent admit that it' not readi for a proper launch, and might not be for some time. Amazon, which is test the concept in Seattle, can't track more than 20 custom simultan and is have difficulti track item onc they'r in customers' possession.So now, wherea Amazon wa expect a public launch by the end of March,th timet ha been push back indefinitely, depend on when the compani work out the kinks.For what it' worth, thi isn't necessarili a bearish develop for Amazon stock so much as it is … well, a delay. While investor were rabid about the concept, see the actual practic applic will simpli take more time to play out. In a way, AMZN' prudenc is a positive, not rush the concept to launch and instead make sure that when Amazon Go goe live, it' on point.Advanc Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit New High in WeeksTechnicals:On the upside, Amazon' push to all-tim high ha crack ani sort of overhead technic resistance. The stock is now trade abov all of it major move averag after bounc off it 50-day MA just a few day ago.In fact, the onli real downsid is that the stock is start to look overbought from a technic perspect accord to the Rel Strength Index (RSI).It' not a perfect guide, and mani stock can continu to rise despit greatli overbought RSI. However, AMZN stock tend to respect thi indic - for instance, the October-Novemb declin came after just a coupl of week of overbought read here.Bottom Line on AMZN StockNon of these three headwind alon is a reason to worri about Amazon share over the long haul, or even for the back half of thi year.And valuat isn't worth mentioning, other than to say that while AMZN is trade at a triple-digit forward price-to-earn ratio, that' never realli mattered.Nonetheless, Amazon stock is start to look technic frothy, by it standards, and with the company' next earn report not due until late April, minor neg driver could get the best of share for the next month or so.Thi could be a good time to buy put on AMZN, or attempt other bearish option strategi that benefit from flat to slightli lower trading.A of thi writing, Robert Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhi Nvidia Corpor (NVDA) Stock Is Downright DangerousIf Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Ha a Shot at a Breakout, Thi Is It10 Small-Cap Stock That Could Doubl in the Next 3 MonthsTh post3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc.

Avoid Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Until $25.70 or Better!;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsCloud play and recent IPOTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) continu to enjoy Street support, but other issu both off and on the price chart continu to suggest not buy into the bull just yet. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrIt ha been a coupl month sinc I last wrote aboutTwilio stock. I wa what you might call a cautiou - or more aptly, an opportunist - bull for the right price. And dure that time, not much ha changed.For one, my opinion on TWLO stock still remain the same. If you don't have profits, cash flow and persist weak stock action trump cutting-edg cloud technolog that ha captur A-list custom likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Hom Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) and privat held marque compani such asUberandAirbnb.Whi the neg regard TWLO stock?

That' alway a possibility, but undeni and nearli ident is TWLO stock itself. While volatil at times, share are pretti much smack dab where they were back in mid-Januari near $28. That' much closer to it all-time-low of $23.66 than the Street' consensu $38 target and all-time-high of $70.96TWLO Stock Daili ChartBack in mid-Januari and after fail to hold a double-bottom pattern abov key support, I thought technically, TWLO stock wa pois for lower price sooner, rather than later. It turn out I wa wrong and an anticip test of Twilio' open and all-time-low of $23.66 ha yet to be tested.Mor to the point, as TWLO stock persist in it weak in the face of a market which refus to give up the ghost, FEY continu to serv as a remind that skeleton in the closet do exist. As such, if you want to believ Twilio will eventu make a turn for the better, it' time (onc again) to consid a credit put spread.TWLO Stock Credit Spread StrategyWhil the TWLO stock price chart didn't fulli cooper with my technic outlook, a below-market put credit spread did just fine last time around. And while I continu to see lower price for Twilio shares, an out-of-the-money vertic still look appropri for investor recept of buy the name at lower levels.Review the option market with TWLO at $28.25, the April $26/$24 put spread is price for 30 cent and look attract given what ha been stated. The seller of thi vertic collect the credit as long as share remain abov $26 at expiration.Th $2.25 margin of safeti from today' $28.25 to the sold $26 strike put amount to a declin of up to nearli 8% over the next three weeks, with the trader still abl to collect the credit.

MSFT stock is up 6%, ad about $25 billion to it market cap, but that gain not onli trail it tech rivals, as the NASDAQ averag is up 9.56%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockHow bad is it? It' so bad that Amazon founder Jeff Bezo is threaten to overtak Microsoft co-found Bill Gate as the world' richest man. He' just $10 billion behind after trade close Mar 29.Thi is not down to ani complac on the part of CEO Satya Nadella and hi team. If anything, they'r move faster than ever. But Microsoft' day as a monopolist are over. It product must all earn their way. They'r all face competit in the marketplace. A person or even a compani can live without MSFT, and while the compani may see thi as liberating, some investor are treat it as a reason to worry.MSFT Stock: A Game CompetitorFor example, Microsoft investor should be bullish at it effort in gaming, but there is plenti of competition.Gam is where developers, and customers, are push the envelop on PC performance. Peopl will spend a lot more for a game machin than for ani other type of consol device. MSFT stock is in the middl of it.10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTh latest version of Window 10, call Creator Update, will featur lot of new game featur when itlaunch April 11, butit' not the revolut the compani promisedwhen they announc it last fall.Microsoft stock got into game through the Xbox console. The latest version brought in $9.1 billion last year and holds26% of the market.But it' not No.1, as that honor goe toSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) and it PlayStat 4. Nor is it the hottest new console. That' theNintendo Co., Ltd. (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY)Switch.MSFT ha launch it own game stream service,Beam Streaming, but that must compet with Amazon' market-lead Twitch service. Game deliveri is a nich control by privately-heldSteam, found by former Microsoft employe in 1996 and now majority-own by Gabe Newell.Still, there is ampl room for growth in gaming, and Microsoft alon ha a posit in everi import niche.Microsoft Stock' New Hope: AzureNadella made hi name at Microsoft build Azure, the company' cloud business. Hi strategi ha been to put all of MSFT' offer into Azure, to offer it softwar directli to user through Azure, and to use cloud-bas applic to domin the enterpris market.H can argu that it' working. Microsoft' revenu from Azure-f businesses, which now includ Offic 365, is $14 billion, and Azur should deliv $2.5 billion in host revenueal by itself.Whil Amazon domin the cloud infrastructur market with a share of over 80%, what investor focu on is the grow competit between Azur andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), whichsom analyst think Googl will win.That would be a disast for Microsoft stock.Offic 365 face grow competit fromGoogle' G Suite, and that in turn meansgrow competit for PC from Googl Chromebooks, which are especi gain share in educationbecaus they'r cheaper, with more of their function online.Noth come easi anymore.Th Bottom Line for MSFT StockAnalyst are gener posit about Microsoft stock, but one-third have it off their buy lists.

Then Answer Thi QuestionMicrosoft today is the third-largest compani in the world, by market cap, at $505 billion. But it oper must race hard to stay in place. Googl is ahead, and Amazon is come up from behind. Technolog domin the stock market, and MSFT stock remain a part of most technolog portfolios.Nadella ha save the company.

If the stock market continu to perform as it ha in the last few months, we could get to that same level by summer.Then look at volatility.Th CBOE Volatil Index, often call the ""fear indicator,"" is current 13 and wa below 10 just a few month ago. That' it lowest pointin historyand almost half it histor level.That mean the market is less worri about a correct now than ever before. Yet we'r face tremend geopolit uncertainty, a possibl big mix-up of American tax law and the now-familiar stori of stagnant wage and rise inflation.So whi isn't the market worried?Beyond First-Level FearsFal corpor profits, high valuat and a complac market make for a scari financi stori and sexi headlin the mainstream financi press can use to attract eyeballs. But investor shouldn't let the whim of a twitchi media influenc their decisions.It' at time like thi thatit pay to be a contrarian investor. Becaus when we take a calm, ration look at the markets, we quickli see that stock aren't overbought at all.In fact, they'r still a bargain.Granted, theSPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)andVanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO)aren't as cheap as they were a year ago, when they were 15% below today' levels, but they'r nowher near price to perfection. What' more, mani of these funds' top hold are actual significantli undervalued.Th Blue Chips: Some Are Cheap and Some ... Not so MuchIt' true thatAmazon.com(AMZN)ha a jaw-drop P/E of 173, andExxon Mobil (XOM)i at a less silly, but still worrying, 43, but if we strip these two stock out, the P/E ratio of the name abov drop to 21.5.Thi bring us to our first rule in compar the S&P 500 to history.It' Not Your Parents' MarketI'm sure you'v seen all the histor extrapol and heard the warn that the S&P 500 is pricier than it ha been throughout it history. But the index use to be full of railroad stock and cigarett manufactur in a world where P/E ratio were lower becaus growth expect were lower. Amazon' P/E ratio is monstrou becaus it earnings-per-shar (EPS) growth over the last three year ha been, well, monstrous, too:Eye-Pop GrowthThi show whi compar the S&P 500 to it past will lead you to a fals percept of it valu today: the index now ha a lot more tech compani with high P/E ratio set up by high EP growth and major expans opportunities.Energi Skew the PictureThat bring us to the second reason whi the S&P 500 look pricier, especi rel to a few year ago. In March 2014, the index had a P/E ratio of 18.5, and thi figur is up over 40% sinc then. There' a simpl reason: energy.In the middl of 2014,oil pricesplummeted. That chop energi stocks' profit from fat margin to massiv losses. Just look at the earn of Exxon andChevron (CVX)over the last three years--and rememb these are the two biggest energi compani in the S&P 500 by far:Oil Compani Profit Flame OutWhil the price of these stock fell too, they didn't (and inde couldn't) fall as much as profit did, lead to the energi sector skew the index' overal P/E ratio.This, incidentally, is one reason why,a I wrote back on Februari 21, I prefer activ stock-pick over passiv investing. It wa clear throughout the second half of 2014 that throw money into energi wa a fool' errand, while the problem in oil and ga creat great opportun in other asset classes, which becam oversold.Similarly, panic is set in that oil will stay low, despit OPEC' best effort to help the commodity. Thi fear--and the correspond declin in energi stocks--skew the S&P 500' overal P/E ratio higher than it recent histor average.Profit Growth Is AcceleratingThes are two compel reason to disregard the warn of an overvalu market, but my smoke gun is futur growth. Corpor profit have been weak in recent years. In fact, earn have bare move sinc the financi crisis, and they remain lower than they were in 2012.But that' changing.Profit are alreadi up 18% from their bottom at the end of 2015, and analyst say they will rise 12% thi year from last year. Thi make a lot of sense; earn have been pressur for a decade, and a combin of lower unemploy and pent-up demand suggest there' room for bottom-lin growth.Thi mean the S&P 500'sforward-lookingP/ ratio is actual a more reason 23.4.It get better. Over the last 20 years, corpor profit have risen by 6% annually. That' includ the dot-com boom and bust, in which the market wa flood by ton of unprofit companies, and the global financi crisi and the follow lean year of massiv unemployment, stagnant wage and low corpor investment. Two horribl financi crises, and still 6% annual growth.What thi mean is that the S&P 500' forward P/E ratio shrink to less than 20 in the next five year if we assum the index' price stay flat.Th Stock Market' Cheap FutureKeep in mind thi is anoverli pessimisticassumption. I'm assum that, after the 12% expect earn growth of 2017, we get earn of 6% in 2018 and then fall earn everi year thereafter. If we actual get 6% everi year, the S&P 500 P/E ratio fall to less than 19.So are stock overpriced? Not really, sinc stock are aforward-look financi instrument.They do not price in histor earn but futur earnings.

The 4 Best Dividend Stocks in Cloud Computing;3/29/2017;"Cloud compani often gener high sale growth with thin margins. They aren't usual associ with dividends, which gener indic that a tech company' high growth day are over.Yet there are still a hand of stock that expos investor to the grow cloud market while pay depend dividends. Let' take a closer look at four such compani --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) ,Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) , andHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();MicrosoftMicrosoft' commerci cloud busi hit an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter -- a 49% jump from a year earlier. CEO Satya Nadella expect that figur to hit $20 billion, or nearli a fifth of Microsoft' revenue, in fiscal 2018. That busi gener most of it revenu from three cloud servic -- Offic 365, Dynam CRM (custom relationship management), and the Azur cloud platform. Azur -- the second largest cloud platform afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AW (Amazon Web Services) -- host applications, analyz data, and loan out comput power.Microsoft pay a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, which is support by a payout ratio of 69%. The compani ha rais that payout annual for 13 straight years. Analyst expect Microsoft' revenu and earn to respect rise 5% and 7% thi year, but it valuat look a bit rich at 31 time earnings.IBMIBM' cloud busi achiev an annual run rate of $13.7 billion last quarter, grow 35% from a year earlier and account for 17% of it top line. Within that total, it cloud servic had an annual run rate of $8.6 billion -- a 61% jump from 2015. Big Blue bundl all it public, private, and hybrid cloud servic into a platform call the IBM Cloud. Notabl product in that suit includ it AI platform Watson, Blockchain for digit transactions, and the Bluemix platform, which compet against AW and Azure.Big Blue pay a forward dividend yield of 3.2% with a payout ratio of 44%. It' rais that dividend annual for 17 straight years. It P/E of 14 is much lower than it industri averag of 21, but analyst expect it revenu to fall 2% thi year and for it earn to rise just 2%.OracleOv the past few years, Oracl ha grown it cloud busi to offset sluggish demand for it age databas and hardwar products. These product includ a mix of SaaS, Paa (platform as a service), and Iaa (infrastructur as a service) product -- which achiev a non-GAAP annual run rate of $5 billion last quarter. Last quarter, Oracle' total cloud revenu rose 62% annual to $1.2 billion and account for 13% of the tech giant' top line.Oracle' forward dividend yield of 1.4% is support by a payout ratio of just 28% -- indic that the tech giant could easili doubl it dividend if it want to. Nonetheless, Oracle' five straight year of dividend hike have kept the yield well below 2%. Analyst expect Oracle' revenu and earn to both rise just 1% thi year, but it multipl of 21 is well below the industri averag of 54 for applic softwar makers.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterpris retain HP' enterpris hardwar and softwar busi after split with the PC, printing, and imag busi in late 2015. Shortli after the split, HPE shut down it Helion public cloud platform, which couldn't compet against larger rival like AWS. But HPE continu provid support for privat and hybrid cloud deployments, and tether those system to AWS, Azure, and other lead public cloud platforms. HPE' adjust softwar revenu fell 1% annual last quarter, but within that business, it cloud softwar as a servic (SaaS) revenu rose 6%.Imag source: HPE.HPE' forward yield of 1.1% look paltry, but it payout ratio of 13% suggest that there' plenti of room for growth. Wall Street expect HPE' revenu and earn to remain nearli flat thi year, due to sluggish enterpris spending, but it trail P/E of 12 make it one of the cheapest larg cap tech play on the market today.Th key takeawaysMicrosoft, IBM, Oracle, and HPE often showcas their cloud growth, but none of these matur compani are gener massiv growth. That' becaus they'r reli heavili on cloud growth to offset weak as their older busi -- like Microsoft' Windows, IBM' hardwar and IT services, Oracle' databas systems, and HPE' age enterpris hardwar and software. Investor should weigh the pro and con of these compani befor invest in them as cloud or incom plays.10 stock we like better than IBMWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Someone Intercept Thursday Night Football From Twitter?;3/29/2017;"Last year,Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) made a big splash when it won the right to stream 10 of the NFL' Thursday Night Footbal games. The social network quickli sold all of it ad inventori for the games, and it wa immens profit for the compani (if at a rel small scale). Twitter reportedli sought to bring in $50 million in ad revenu from it content partnership with the NFL, and probabl exceed it goal. Consid it paid just $10 million for the stream rights, that' a good deal.But there' no guarante the NFL will renew it deal with Twitter. Other big tech compani likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl are also reportedli interest in the right as well. Let' take a look at what Thursday Night Footbal might mean to each interest company.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();TwitterTwitt know what it' get with the NFL and the NFL know what it' get with Twitter. Twitter ha a rel broad establish global audienc that alreadi talk a lot about sport on it social network. Last year' result show that at least a few of them are will to stream the game on the same platform they go to talk about it.But Twitter' viewership number may have been a bit disappointing, particularli for advertisers. Twitter averag just200,000 to 300,000 viewer per gameon average. Twitter prefer to point to the 3.5 million uniqu viewer per game on average, but the televis rate standard use averag audience. By comparison, the televis broadcast consist had over 10 million viewer and even top 20 million viewer on occasion.Thos rate are noteworthi becaus market paid quit a bit for Twitter' ad -- around $250,000 for a packag of 20 ad dure the game and some pre-rol ad on NFL highlights. That' nearli half of what advertis paid for the televis broadcast to reach an audienc about 2% the size. Twitter is switch toguarante viewershipon some video ads, so the NFL deal might not be as lucr for Twitter thi time around.FacebookFacebook offer similar benefit to the NFL as Twitter, but it ha a scale that' five time larger. While Twitter is gener consid the place to discuss live sport events, Facebook still ha the potenti to attract a much broader and engag audience. Facebook boast that it user spend 50 minut per day on averag across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. With a broad portfolio of apps, Facebook should be abl to promot and attract a much bigger audienc than Twitter.A deal with the NFL could help Facebook seed it dedic video section. The compani is interest in pay for premium video content to attract user to watch and upload more video to the social network. Facebook is also test midrol video ad to directli monet video on it platform, and Thursday Night Footbal could provid a nice playground for the ad format.AmazonWhil Amazon doesn't sport the same audienc as Facebook or even Twitter, it' certainli will to pay up for the NFL stream rights. In fact, it offer $15 million for the right last year, $5 million more than Twitter end up paying. The NFL end up go with Twitter for it abil to reach a global audience.But thing have chang at Amazon over the last year. Most notably, Amazon expand Prime Video global in December. It' also been negoti for the right to stream sport that are less popular in the U.S., but veri popular intern like auto race and soccer. If Amazon can put togeth a packag of sport right for it intern subscribers, becom a destin to stream games, it could convinc the NFL to take a shot with it.Of course, the NFL will like stipul that Amazon stream the game to everyone, not just Prime subscribers. Nonetheless, Amazon could use it as a market tool for Prime Video as well as way to grow itsburgeon advertis business.YouTubeYouTub is current face some backlash for place ad next to objection content. A deal with the NFL could provid a boost to YouTube' reput as a place for premium digit video content. At the same time, YouTube' current reput struggl could deter the NFL from make a deal in the first place, as the leagu is veri brand conscious.YouTub is make a play for more televis ad dollars, particularli with the impend releas of YouTub Unplugged, it over-the-top linear televis service. The compani will alreadi be sell televis advertis for YouTub Unplugged, and it could use Google' ad target data to maxim it ad revenue. That factor will put it at the top of the list for it abil to success monet an invest in Thursday Night Football, which could enabl it to come in with the highest bid among the compani in thi article.Overall, each compani ha a lot to gain from win the right to Thursday Night Football. Twitter certainli ha the most to lose if it doesn't win, consid analyst alreadi expect a declin in ad revenu thi year. The NFL is expect to announc a winner in the next month or so, sinc it announc the Twitter deal last April.10 stock we like better than TwitterWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Things FedEx Corporation Management Wants You to Know;3/28/2017;"Last week,FedEx(NYSE: FDX) post anugli earn missfor the third quarter of it 2017 fiscal year. However, investor and Wall Street analyst shrug off FedEx' disappoint result due to it strong outlook.FedEx' earn call play a big role in convinc investor to look past the company' weak results. Let' take a look at five key point that manag highlighted.TNT integr is on trackIn the nine month follow close, we learn a great deal more about the TNT business. The busi we acquir wa sever underinvested, particularli in IT and in operations, which is drive addit investments.-- FedEx CFO Alan GrafmakeArticleAd();Last year, FedEx made it biggest acquisit ever, buy it smaller European rival TNT Express. TNT Express ha a veri strong road deliveri network in Europe, which is a valuabl asset. However, the compani ha struggl in recent years, which ha led to underinvestment. Furthermore, both FedEx Express and TNT Express have been work through multiyear profit improv plan recently.A a result, the FedEx leadership team ha rethought the integr plan for TNT Express. While manag didn't offer mani specifics, CFO Alan Graf said that FedEx ha now implement a more ""streamlined"" plan to harmon the integr process with TNT Express' intern restructur efforts.FedEx is busi integr TNT into it own express deliveri network. Imag source: Pixabay.Start in fiscal 2018, FedEx will integr TNT Express into the FedEx Express segment for financi report purposes. And by 2020, FedEx expect oper profit for that segment to rise by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, rel to fiscal 2017.The ground busi will bounc back quicklyI should note, given the interest in the subject, FedEx Ground segment margin will be 15%-plu in the current quarter.-- FedEx CEO Fred SmithTh biggest disappoint within FedEx' Q3 result wa the profit declin at it ground deliveri business. The ground segment' profit margin slid to 11% from 12.6% a year earlier, caus segment oper incom to fall 7.5% year over year. A few year ago, FedEx Ground wa earn much higher margin while deliv strong revenu growth.Th ground segment wa hamper last quarter by overcapac dure the peak season, as some big custom made fewer shipment than expected. However, the compani expect to bounc back thi quarter, with a ground segment margin of at least 15%. That would be roughli in line with the company' perform in Q4 of fiscal 2016.Make tough choic to boost ground profitability[W] have been back away from some customers, and rais our price significantly.-- GrafTo get the ground busi back on track, FedEx ha realiz that it need to push price higher, particularli for e-commerc shippers. The margin pressur of the past few year can be attribut in part to a disproportion focu on growth rather than profitability.Pr increas were alreadi evid in last quarter' results, yet FedEx Ground' profit margin remain unaccept low. Clearly, there is still plenti of work to be done on thi front.Not worri about disrupt from AmazonTh vast major of FedEx busi is business-to-business. 85% plu of our busi ha noth to do with e-commerce.-- SmithA recur worri among some investor is thatAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) will tri to disrupt packag deliveri compani like FedEx and UPS. These fear have grown as the e-commerc giant ha start to build up it own intern deliveri network. Amazon.com ha also leas a fleet of cargo plane and plan to open an air cargo hub soon.It doe seem like that Amazon will becom a competitor, handl most of it own shipment intern and offer similar servic for other e-commerc retailers. However, e-commerc is a small (albeit fast-growing) part of FedEx' business. As CEO Fred Smith point out on the earn call, business-to-busi shipment still drive 85% of FedEx' revenue.Capex requir should gradual recedeTh biggest requir for capit over the next five year will remain, the refleet at Express. ... I think over time, we will start to see, post-FY18, capex as a percentag of revenu will begin to decline.-- GrafFedEx ha had an ever-increas thirst for capit in recent years. Capex ha surg from $3.5 billion in fiscal 2014 to an estim $5.3 billion in fiscal 2017. Thi ha weigh on the company' free cash flow production.FedEx expect capex to continu at around the current pace for the forese future. A larg chunk of thi budget will go toward new cargo aircraft. The compani ha an averag of 16 new wide-bodi plane per year schedul for deliveri over the next five years.On the bright side, thi fleet renew process will boost efficiency, help FedEx meet it target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of profit improv in the express segment. Furthermore, if FedEx' revenu rise as expect in the come years, capex will gradual declin as a percentag of revenue.10 stock we like better than FedExWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock Still Isn’t Cheap Enough;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIncredibly,Freeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) stock ha deliv a return of 4% sinc it 1995 spin-off. That' not a 4% return per year, mind you. Rather, FCX stock ha risen 4%totalsinc 1995.makeArticleAd();Source:Nick Bastian via Flickr (Modified)To be fair, if you add in dividends, Freeport-McMoRan stock ha return about 2.6% per year, on average. But that quit obvious is an underperform rel to both broad market and to copper itself. Copper price have more than doubl over that nearli 23-year stretch; FCX stock ha return about 76%,To be fair, FCX stock isn't the onli miner to provid poor returns.Barrick Gold Corp (USA)(NYSE:ABX) ha provid neg return over the same period.Southern Copper Corp(NYSE:SCCO) sharehold have lost money over the past decade.Franco Nevada Corp(NYSE:FNV) ha been one of the few large-cap miner to actual drive sharehold returns.Freeport-McMoRan stock, however, ha suffer from self-inflict wounds. FCX bought Phelp Dodg with copper at a peak in earli 2007. It decid to reacquir it oil and ga oper in 2012, not long befor price in both commod plunged. For all of the discuss about the company' leverag to copper price - and what those price might be - execut ha been extrem poor. FCX stock ha rarely, if ever, provid what it investor want:leverag to higher copper prices.With Freeport-McMoRan stock down about 25% from a near-term peak, I remain skeptic that will chang ani time soon. FCX remain a compani beset by troubl and execut errors. And Freeport-McMoRan stock remain an 'avoid' - at best.FCX Stock Ha the Wrong Kind Of LeverageIt might be tempt to assum that Freeport-McMoRan stock ha declin of late simpli becaus of lower copper prices. That' not realli the case. The acquisit of it former O&G busi (spun off in 1994) along with Plain Explor cost some $9 billion. FCX dump most of those asset toAnadarko Petroleum Corporation(NYSE:APC) for $2 billion last year.Th 7 WORST Stock to Buy Right NowEven with that sale and the divest of it stake in the Tenk mine in the Democrat Republ of Congo, Freeport-McMoRan still ha some $16 billion in debt, and over $12 billion on a net basis. To get even to that point, the compani not onli sold assets, but cut the dividend and issu $1.5 billion in new FCX stock. Both action sent Freeport-McMoRan stock lower.Look forward, it may be that FCX can get back to provid some sort of leverag to higher prices. Accord to the company' fourth quarter earn presentation, a simpl $0.10 per pound chang in copper price could add $415 million in EBITDA, and $320 million in cash flow. But the problem with the balanc sheet is that it magnifi ani downsid risk. A move in copper back to $2 would wipe out a substanti amount of Freeport-McMoRan' cash flow. And that would lead FCX stock to plung even further.Indonesia, Copper Prices, And Freeport-McMoRan StockMeanwhile, Freeport-McMoran is engag in a disput over it Grasberg mine in Indonesia. The Indonesian govern now say it is entitl totak a major stake, against current hold just over 9%. FCX bitterli disagrees, but it' not clear whether it will win, even if it interpret of the agreement is correct. Meanwhile, worker at the mine have threaten a strike, given that Freeport-McMoRan ha cut back product substantially.Th ironi for FCX stock is that it travail are in part keep the price of copper up. Limit product from Grasberg, and strike at it Cerro Verd mine in Peru and anoth Chilean mine majority-own byBHP Billiton Limit (ADR)(NYSE:BHP), have help copper price stay afloat.So it seem like that a resolut for FCX in either Chile and/or Indonesia might also lead copper price back down, as that suppli return to the market. And that like would offset some of the benefit of that good news for Freeport-McMoRan stock.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) See Groceri as It Holi GrailTh broader issue, from a histor perspective, is that it' easi to assum these problem are one-time. But for worldwid miners, usual oper in develop countri with lower level of corpor legal protection, these issu are somewhat common. And that' a big reason whi FCX stock hasn't done what it' suppos to do.Bullish Copper? Buy CopperAt the end of the day, ani bull case for Freeport-McMoRan stock requir some amount of bullish on worldwid copper prices. But in thi day and age, there' no reason to buy FCX stock - or SCCO stock - to get that exposure. Copper exchange-trad fund and exchange-trad note are available, with no execut risk. Even individu investor can make higher-risk futur and option trade in most accounts.I'm not recommend those trades, to be sure. But for investor who want to profit from a rise in copper, the simplest and most logic way seem to be to buy copper directly, in some form. Expect FCX to provid that exposur in a profit way ignor both the company' histori and it current situation. And it mean that FCX stock isn't ""cheap enough"", even down 25%.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-Hot7 Consum Stock That Will Lead Your PortfolioTh postFreeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock Still Isn't Cheap Enoughappear first onInvestorPlace."

I suggest buy AMZN stock onit recent earn missand the stori had bare been post befor Amazon stock recovered. That' a sign of a hot stock.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonAt it current level of about $851 per share, you'r look at a 13% gain year-to-date, a 46% gain for the full year.

Should investor be suspicious? If recentnewsof a potenti delay in the launch of it Amazon Go groceri store is ani indication, the company' ambit will be more difficult to turn into reality. Report indic that AMZN is struggl to keep track of it custom and item in it test stores.However, technic issu aside, Tom Caporaso, CEO ofClaru Commerce, which offer onlin merchant subscript and loyalti programs, told me that investor shouldn't be skeptic of it object to enter the groceri space.AMZN and Groceries: The Point Is VelocityTh point of get into fresh food isn't to gain sale and margin, he said, but velocity. ""Amazon is a close loop market engine,"" in which the more often you buy from Amazon, the more thing it can sell. If you'r buy appl and kale from AMZN, you'r buy from them sever time a week, and that is the point of the exercise.10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotY shouldn't expect hundr of Amazon store to open thi year, Caporaso said, mayb no more than 20, and you shouldn't expect Amazon to be sell banana everywher all at once. It' the company' abil to learn from mistak that make it powerful, and it willing to tri again with an improv offer that make it such a fearsom competitor.""They start small, learn and optimize, then roll out over time instead of get in big,"" he explained. ""They are data driven, take these idea and continu move forward base on data, rather than make big bets.""Meal Are the Holi Grail for Amazon StockWher Amazon is heading, Caporaso said, is the dinner table, and thi should make grocer likeKrog Co(NYSE:KR),Whol Food Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) andWal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT) veri nervou over the next two to five years.Th woman to watch is Martha Stewart, who is now sell her meal kit through AmazonFreshin four markets.Ther are now150 player in thi space, sell pre-packag meal ingredients, with direct and look to disrupt both grocer and restaurants.Th point of a meal kit is that you get everyth you need to cook a meal, which can both minim food wast and teach basic cook skills.

(AMD) Stock Gear Up for WarFor now, Amazon is let Martha worri about that. AMZN want to see if it infrastructur can be the extra ingredi that make the meal kit pay befor it make a major play. Onc it does, Caporaso said, watch out.Bottom Line on AMZN StockTh main reason investor have gone from hate Amazon stock to love it over the last three year is that the compani may still make mistakes, but it is care now to make small mistak only. Thi is a lesson it learned, the hard way, with it Fire Phone. Send a piec of hardwar to do what an app could do, or a collect of app in Amazon' case, wa it biggest mistake, which taught it it biggest lesson.Groceries, especi fresh groceries, may not add much to the AMZN stock' bottom line, but it doe increas how mani time peopl use the service, the util they get from the servic and, in the long run, further Amazon' plan to domin all retailing.

Better yet, it' hard to imagin how ani of it product categori could be disrupt at ani point in the future. That should provid investor with lot of confid that demand for it product isn't like to diminish anytim soon.A look at the company' histori show just how profit it can be to sell bore products. The compani ha paid a dividend everi year sinc 1895 and ha rais it payout for 54 straight years.

With more than 4,900 properti in it portfolio, those check add up to more $1.1 billion in annual revenue.Whil invest in retail properti might sound risky, you should know that Realti Incom like to focu on tenant that are eitherAmazon.com-proof (think movi theater or fit centers) or recession-resist (think ga station or dollar stores). Thi fact help to make the company' busi more immun to the chang retail landscap than you might otherwis assume. Add in a dividend yield of 4.2%, and it' easi to see whi I think thi is a great stock for ani investor after low-risk income.A crafti way to play the upscale-alcohol trendAmerican consum have been increasingli will to pay a premium to get their hand on high-end alcohol beverages.

Amazon ha been busi invest in new warehous to speed up deliveri and bring even more custom into it membership program, and AW revenu ha continu to skyrocket, with 55% growth, and offer margin that are much stronger than the company' retail division, help to fund overal expansion.J.C.

In it first-quart guidance, the compani indic that it would invest more, lower oper profit, but the long-term path to profit growth look solid.IncomeNeith J.C. Penney nor Amazon offer dividends, so dividend investor will like look elsewher for income. However, with it long-term focus, thin profit margin, and high valuation, Amazon is unlik to pay a dividend or buy back share anytim soon.J.C.

3 Big-Name Stocks With Dangerous Dividends;3/27/2017;"By Brett OwensToday I'm bring you a round of good news ... and a round of bad news.Th good? So far, thi year' been better than last for dividend hound (like us) hope to dodg a nasti payout cut.makeArticleAd();Accord to Standard & Poor's, 85 American compani cut their payout in Januari and February. That' still a big number, but it' down sharpli from 119 in the first two month of 2016.That' partli becaus we'r anoth year out from the oil crash, and the first two month of 2016 saw some big cut in the sector.ConocoPhillip (COP),for example, drop it first cut in 25 years--to the tune of 67%--on shareholders, whilePrecis Drill (PD)toss it payout entirely.Th bad news? Just becaus the goo is hang in just below $50 a barrel and the number of cutter is down doesn't mean we'r out of the woods.Becaus there' a new threat on the horizon: rise interest rates--and first-level investor are ignor how much they'll squeez debt-laden sacr cows, includ mani Dividend Aristocrats.Throw in the S&P 500' noseble price-to-earn ratio of 25, and you'v got a recip for some harsh share-pric drop when the next cut come, and I don't want you to get hit. That' whi I'v flag three blue chip youmustavoid now (or dump if you alreadi own them).PBI: A Payout on Borrow TimePitney Bow (PBI)ha two thing go for it: a well-known name and a high 6.0% forward dividend yield.But don't be fooled--that yield isn't becaus the quarterli dividend is rise (it hasn't move sinc April 2013, when it wasslashedbi 50%). It' becaus Pitney' share price ha crater from $28.18 in Juli 2014 to just around $12.70 now.You'd think a 50% cut would be enough to stabil the dividend ... but you'd be wrong. Pitney still sent a ridicul 151.5% of it last 12 month of earn out to shareholders--and that payout ratio is climb as profit go into free fall:Th Chart Everi Dividend Investor DreadsPitneyispay out a more reason 42.6% of free cash flow, so it dividend isn't in immin danger. But there' anoth figur that worri me more: long-term debt. At $3.4 billion, it' actual 44.7%abovePitney' $2.3-billion market cap!That' a heavi burden for a compani that' make the treacher shift from old-school mail servic to e-commerce. And after year of go therightway, Pitney' debt load is start to rise again:Pitney Take a Step BackMi take: Forget Pitney and it 6.0% yield, especi when there are safer--and more generous--dividend payer available, like the three 8%+ yielder my colleagu Michael Fosterrecommend on March 22.LB: Snapshot of a Yield TrapLik Pitney,L Brand (LB),owner of the Victoria' Secret and Bath & Bodywork chains, look like a tempt play--at first. It yield ha pop from 4.1% to over 5% in the last month, and it P/E ratio is now a tantal 12.0, a place it hasn't been sinc 2009.But if you take the bait, be readi to lose your shirtandyour income, becaus there' a good reason for both these moves: the ""price"" part of both the P/E and the yield ha crashed--18% in the last month alone--on a wave of bad news that like won't ebb soon.L Brands' Veri Bad, No Good MonthFirst came the fourth-quart numbers: EP beat expect handily, but guidanc for 2017 came in between $3.05 and $3.35, well off the $3.98 LB earn in 2016 and the $3.70 the Street expected.Then on March 2, the compani said Februari sale were down 10% from a year ago. Granted, eight percentag point of that drop came from it move to exit the swimwear and apparel categories, but that doesn't chang the overal trend.Th next hit could be a dividend cut that would stun first-level investors--and wallop LB' share yet again--even though the writing' been on the wall for years: the company' payout ratio ha been creep up sinc earli 2014, and LB now pay out more in dividend than it gener in both EP and free cash flow:A Dividend Cut in the MakingYet anoth headache: the ""stay-at-home"" economy, which ha more peopl buy online, not at the mall. And accord to a Februari report from MarketWatch,Amazon.com (AMZN)i gear up to grab a bigger share of the US lingeri market.Mosaic: One Cut Down, One More to Come?Mosa Co. (MOS):Fat final caught up with the fertil maker after I flag it asa prime candid for a dividend cutin November. At the time, rivalsPotash Corp. (POT)andAgrium (AGU)had alreadi slash their payout by 34% and 27%, respectively.Mosa sharehold who held on in hope of escap a similar disast paid dearly: on Februari 7, manag chop the dividend by 45%, from $1.10 annual to $0.60.So you'r probabl wondering: if the damag is alreadi done, whi are we talk about Mosaic again?Simple. I'd still be on edg if I own thi one. Becaus there are a lot of move part here.Consid that analyst forecast EP of $1.07 for all of 2017, and Mosaic' new payout is 56% of that, which is still abov the 50% I demand in a dividend stock. Mosaic' long-term debt ha also soar from $1.0 billion to $3.8 billion in just the last four years. Finally, the recoveri in fertil price is expect to be tepid.Al of thi mean pretti well everyth ha to go right for Mosaic, or you could easili find yourself face anoth dividend cut. That' just too much risk to take for a 2.1% forward yield.6 Safe Buy for 8% Yield and Double-Digit GainsJust imagin if you held L Brand in the past month:you would have stood by helplessli as nearli 20% of your cash vanish into thin air!That' just the beginning. Wait and see what happen when the inevit dividend cut comes.Thi is the fatal flaw in so mani first-level investors' thinking: they see a big name and a big market cap and think a compani will be around forever. But today, when new technolog can upend whole industri overnight,thi is the riskiest bet you can make!That' where our""8.0% No-Withdraw Retir Portfolio""com in. The 6 invest insid it protect your nest egg by spread it out out across market sectors.And thesaf 8.0% averag yieldit throw off give you a great shot at beat the market' total return in cash alone! That' to say noth of the 10% to 15% discount these incom wonder are sport as I write this.Thi is how everyon should approach investing. But sadly, few folk can ever find the reliabl 8.0%+ payer that can take them there.That stop today.Don't miss out.Click here to discov my full strategi and get my 6 best buy for a safe 8.0% averag yield now."
Facebook Is Partnering With Amazon.com to Take on Google;3/27/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is alreadi a domin forc in digit display advertising. eMarkt expect the social network giant' share of the U.S. market to climb to 39.1% thi year, as it sell more than three time as much display advertis as it next closest competitor, Google. TheAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) compani is expect to gener $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertis thi year.But Facebook' ad revenu is larg confin to it own properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audienc Network (FAN) -- it ad network -- gener onli a few hundr million in annual net ad revenu for the company. That number could get a signific boost in the near term, as Facebook just announc it' roll out header bid to all mobil web publishers. That repres not onli a signific opportun for Facebook to increas it network ad revenue, but a threat to Google' display ad busi as well.Imag source: FacebookmakeArticleAd();Publish love header biddingHead bid is a system that level the play field when it come to sell ad online. Previously, whenev you load a web page, that publish would check ad network one by one until it found an advertis will to pay a reason price to popul the ad on the site. Sinc Googl is such a domin forc in advertising, publishers' search usual start and end with Google.Head bid allow publish to collect bid from multipl ad network at the same time and receiv the highest bid for it ad inventory. As a result, publish receiv more revenu for their ads, and smaller ad network stand a fight chanc against Google. The more ad network support header bidding, the better it is for publishers. Facebook say publish in it test saw a revenu increas of 10% to 30%.Imag source: FacebookAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) notabl develop a header bid solut last year in an effort to potenti growit advertis business. Given Amazon' prowess in cloud comput -- support hundr of major websit -- it integr cloud-bas solut could prove extrem popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is partner with Amazon and sever other header-bid system develop to bring it ad network to more publishers.Grow the ad networkFacebook' audienc network still repres a small part of Facebook' revenue. It reach a $1 billion run rate at the begin of 2016, but that' gross revenue. Facebook onli keep a small percentag of that figur as net revenue.Dur Facebook' second-quart earn call last year, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts: ""The overal growth is still be driven predominantli by Facebook. Instagram is clearli make a contribution, as is the Audienc Network.""That may chang later thi year, however, as Facebook face ad load saturation. But with the social network' steadi user growth and continu increas in engagement, Facebook' enorm will still be tough to overshadow.Nonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainli help Facebook offset some of the slowdown at it flagship app. In fact, sinc the audienc network use the same target data as Facebook' in-hous ads, Facebook advertis may be inclin to start buy more ad on Facebook, especi if header bid increas it abil to win bid on publishers' websites.FAN repres an opportun for market to reach Facebook' audienc outsid Facebook and even expand beyond Facebook. Manag say FAN offer 16% greater reach than Facebook alon and now reach 1 billion peopl monthly.Th impact on GoogleTh valu of FAN to publish is that Facebook requir market to bid the same on FAN ad as on it own ads. Therefore, third-parti publish get the same (presum high) rate as Facebook. If Facebook' averag bid is higher than Google's, it could forc Googl to lower it take rate from publishers.Last year, Googl gener $15.6 billion in gross revenu from it network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in revenu share to those publishers, about 70%. In fact, publishers' revenu share from Googl ha increas two percentag point sinc 2014, when header bid start becom popular.Googl said that ""the increas in Network Members' TAC [traffic acquisit cost] rate wa primarili driven by the shift in advertis buy from our tradit network busi to programmat advertis buying."" As more ad sale shift to header bid and more ad network like Facebook join the fray, Googl stand to see that number continu climbing, unless it want to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenu it gener last year.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Whether you are pro-BABA stock or one of the mani skeptics, the question one must ask themselv is whether the sum of the part of Alibaba stock is worth more than the current price of $108 and change.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMor bluntli state - is the intrins valu of BABA stock appreci greater than $108? Not just five or $10, but 50% greater or perhap more becaus if it' not, there' no reason to hold it stock long-term.W all know the intrins valu of a stock is imposs to calculate, so the next best solut is to estim the valu of each of Alibaba' variou businesses, includ it core e-commerc segment, which account for a lion' share of overal revenue.Warren Buffett recentlysaidin hi letter to sharehold that he would buy lot ofBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) stock if it trade within 120% of it book valu per share, which Buffett state in hi 2016 letter to sharehold ""… is a signific discount to Berkshire' intrins value, a spread that is appropri becaus calcul of intrins valu be precise.""So, befor get into a sum of the part calculation, we need to find out what Alibaba stock' price-to-book ratio is becaus that give us a better indic whether it' current trade at a discount to it intrins value.BABA stock' current P/B ratio is 6.9, which mean Buffett, if appli the same 120% rule to Alibaba stock, which he like wouldn't do given Alibaba is a growth stock and a much differ kettl of fish than Berkshir Hathaway, he would pay no more than $18.32 or about one-sixth it current value.10 Small-Cap Stock That Could Doubl in the Next 3 MonthsThi sum of the part calcul better be good becaus if not, investor are serious overpay for Alibaba stock.To speed thi process along I'v borrow inform from Coho Capital' 2016letter to shareholders.

With Amazon' AW busi gener $12.2 billion in annual revenu in 2016 and veri profitable, BABA stock holder should expect the question mark on Alicloud' valu per share to disappear within the next two years.If I had to put a guess on it, I'd say Alibaba' cloud busi is easili worth $10 to $15 per share, probabl a lot more onc 12 to 24 month pass and we have a clearer pictur of Alicloud' contribut to Alibaba' overal business.From where I sit, a sum of the part calcul make BABA stock a deal at $108 per share; at $80 it' a steal.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Small-Cap Stock That Serv Up Big Dividends10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Worth More Than You Thinkappear first onInvestorPlace."

So let' take a look at what the compani is do and whi it may be invest in these new strategies:Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();AmazonFresh PickupAmazon enter the groceri busi back in 2007 with it AmazonFresh groceri deliveri service, but anew reportbi GeekWir show that the compani is about to add physic locat where custom can pick up onlin order themselves.Amazon is reportedli call these new locat AmazonFresh Pickup, and the first two store will be in Seattle' SoDo and Ballard neighborhoods.Imag source: Amazon Fresh Facebook page.In permit document Amazon file for the store the compani said that sign insid of the store would read, ""Shop online. Pick up here,"" and ""Relax while we load your groceries.""Thi match up with separ document Amazon file last year that said the compani wa consid physic store where custom could pickup onlin groceri order by park in stall and have employe load the order into their cars. A separ option to place an order in the physic store on a tablet and then wait for the item wa also described, though it' not clear if thi is how Amazon' new store will work.Amazon ha yet to make ani announc about the stores, but the GeekWir articl note that the locat are alreadi built and sign bear the AmazonFresh Pickup name have alreadi been put up.Amazon GoLat last year, Amazon introduc an entir new conveni store concept, call Amazon Go. The store, which is onli avail to Amazon employe right now, use technolog to automat charg custom for item as they walk out of the store.Th Amazon Go store use comput vision, sensor fusion, and deep learn algorithm to know which item a custom ha pick up (and which one have been place back on the shelf), and then charg them for the item when they leav the store. All a custom ha to do is scan their Amazon Go app when they first enter the store, and the company' Just Walk Out Technolog take care of the rest.Th Amazon Go store offer ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinners, and fresh snack made by on-sit chef and other food from local businesses. The compani said that it' open up the store to the public onc it out of beta mode sometim thi year.Amazon BooksTh onlin retail open it first physic bookstor last year and now ha a store in Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, and California, with six more come soon. The bookstor sell book of course, but are also use to show off the company' tablets, Kindles, Fire TV, and Echo devices.Imag source: Amazon.Amazon say on it websit that it in-stor book select consist of thousand of book that are pick ""base on Amazon.com custom ratings, pre-orders, sales, popular on Goodreads, and our curators' assessments."" Asid from help custom find books, the compani say the bookstor employe will also help custom learn about Amazon' devices.Whi the physic store push?Whil it might seem a bit curiou that Amazon would be interest in physic stores, there are sever reason whi thi all make sense.In aninterviewwith CNBC last year Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at Benchmark, said that the company' bookstor were about ""showroom-ing"" and that Amazon could use the store to ""highlight their product line-up as they continu to battl for live room share.""Amazon use it Kindl and Fire tablet to help bring peopl further into it onlin retail ecosystem, so have physic locat where Amazon can show off those product and explain it Prime Membership servic would clearli be beneficial. AndMorningstaranalyst R.J. Hottovi also believ the store could eventu be use as place to pickup onlin order or a conveni place to drop off returns.A for Amazon' push into conveni store and groceri pickup, the compani is like tri to tap into the massiv $674 billion groceri market by do what it doe best -- drive onlin and digit sales. Onlin purchas make up just 1% of the groceri market right now and Amazon view it Amazon Go and AmazonFresh Pickup store as possibl way to disrupt the groceri market.Investor should rememb that while Amazon might be do some excit thing with physic stores, they'r still just test project for the compani right now. They shouldn't be taken as a new direct for the company, but rather a sign that Amazon is will to tri new thing in order to discov new way to gain customers, add Prime members, and learn custom habits.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

20 Questions With Tom Vilord of Vilord Wealth Advisors;3/23/2017;"1. What is the best invest advic you have ever been given?Do not just buy a great compani becaus you like the product or understand the business. Onli buy if the stock is trade at a margin of safety. Buy at a MO will cover my butt if I happen to miscalcul the intrins value.2. What level of math is need in order to understand the entireti of financ and investing?makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) doe not use a calculator. I use basic math my 10-year-old understands. If you can read and you have a smartphon calculator, you can do thi just like the pro on Wall Street. Most of the calcul I run have just three to four input that are requir to come up with a valu of the business. You certainli do not need a calculu background to do thi stuff.3. Is ""valu investing"" (Warren Buffett(Trades, Portfolio) & Benjamin Graham approach) a good invest strategi for long-term goal like invest for retirement?That is the strategi I am use for my retirement. Valu invest is all about find great, solid compani with a great manag team in place, a rock-solid financi statement and buy them onli when the stock is at a discount to fair value. It hard to go wrong with that strategy. There will be year where other strategi outperform the valu invest strategy, but over the long term it is the onli one I have use that ha consist perform veri well. And, in my opinion, with much less risk becaus we know the compani and we know the valu of that business.4. What should I know befor I start valu investing?Y should go toBerkshir Hathaway' (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) websit and read everi singl letter to sharehold by Buffett from 1977 to 2016. I would also read ""The Intellig Investor"" by Benjamin Graham. Onc you read those, do not stop reading. I love ""Rule #1"" by Phil Town, ""The Littl Book that Beat the Market"" and ""You Can Be a Stock Market Genius"" by Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), ""The Dhando Investor"" by Mohnish Pabrai (Trades, Portfolio) and everi other valu invest book you can find. There is a wealth of inform out there.5. How should one invest in a bear market?I would invest in a bear market the exact same way I would invest in a flat or bullish market. Find great companies, analyz the heck out of them, find the intrins valu and buy it on sale. If you know how to valu a compani or the entir market, you will be prepar for a correction. If you are prepar for a correction, then you will have more money on the sidelin than usual. And if you have money in cash, you can take full advantag of all of the opportun a bear market give us. It harder right now to find a great compani at a great price. The S&P 500' price-earn ratio is 28.96 as of March 22. The averag is about 16.7. That is grossli overvalu compar to histor valuations. The market cap to GDP ratio, also known as the Buffett Indicator, is current at 125.3 today as well. Histori show us a read between 75 and 90 is fairli valued, 90 to 115 is overvalu and anyth over 115 is significantli overvalued.In Buffett' Fortun magazin interview in 2001, he said that ""it is probabl the best singl measur of where valuat stand at ani given moment."" Base on that knowledge, I think there is a better chanc of the market come back down to a normal level than to continu to trade at these overvalu levels. If I can find an invest that make sens right now, I will invest in it. However, I have not found a great compani at a great price in quit some time. Therefore, I have more money in cash. I am OK with that becaus it is protect if we do have a major or minor selloff. If that happens, I will have cash readili avail to invest onc the busi on my watch list are price at a discount.6. What are exampl of sustain competit advantages?I think of moat when I hear of competit advantages. The five moat that come to mind are brand moat, price moat, secret moat, switch moat and toll bridg moat. I like brand moat becaus a success brand is hard to compet with. To me,Disney(DIS) ha a fantast brand. It repres quality, servic and custom experi unlik anyth I have ever seen. If I want to build an entertain empire, it would be nearli imposs for me to compet with a brand like Disney. It ha proven to have a sustain competit advantag for decades.Pric moat is be the lowest cost provider. In the past, that wa probabl my least favorit moat becaus if your onli advantag is be the lowest cost provider, you may be give up someth els such as custom service. For example,Wal-Mart(WMT) is the lowest cost provider, but when you go into it stores, there are not enough peopl work the registers. It drive me nuts, so now I onli go there if I have to. I love whatAmazon(AMZN) ha done. It ha been a lower cost provid too, but you also get a great custom servic experience. Use Amazon is extrem easi and convenient, and they are constantli strive to improv the custom experi by offer discount and free ship and, hope in the near future, same-day delivery. It hard to compet with a compani like Amazon who ha everyth you can imagin in stock, usual at the best price, along with quick and easi delivery. I love that company.Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a compani that ha a huge secret moat, butPfizer(PFE) certainli had that back in the day when it develop Viagra. It had the secret to the magic littl pill and it wa patent protect for 17 years. Investor who were on board with Pfizer back then had quit a nice run.Switch is anoth moat. I do not thinkToronto-Dominion Bank(TD) ha a moat that separ it from ani other bank other than be veri convenient, but a moat that mani bank have is switching. Most of the time I am veri happi with Toronto-Dominion. But everi onc in a while they annoy me. However, someth realli bad would have to happen to my account or the bank as a whole to get me to transfer my account becaus it would be so inconveni to switch. I have all of my bill set up with bill pay, I have direct deposit set up for incom paycheck and direct deposit for outgo IRA and brokerag account deposits. It is too much of a hassl to switch.Lastly, toll bridg moat. If you live in a geograph area where there may onli be one util compani or cabl company, then they too have a great competit advantage. If they are the onli game in town, they have no competition. Also, it would be veri difficult and costli for me to start up my own cabl compani in South Jersey and tri to compet withComcast(CMCSA).7. What are the absolut best, most crucial tip or idea to succeed in long-term investing?Thi is an easi one to answer. The best tip I can give is to throw away your emotions. If you get your emot involved, you will jump on a stock' bandwagon after it ha alreadi gone up and you will sell out of fear at the worst times. You need to know valuat so emot do not get in the way. If you know how to valu a business, your buy decis and sell decis will be base on numer facts, not emotions.8. What are the essenti of due dilig when investing?Ther is a lot of account data to look at when valu a business, but you also have to read the annual and quarterli reports, especi the risk section and legal proceed section. Also read articl about the company, the industry, the execut and so on. The number tell us a lot about the business, but not the entir story. We can find a treasur trove of inform we will never see in the financi report by read annual (10k) and quarterli (10q) reports.9. What kind of stock would you rather avoid hold becaus they are more riski than others?Overvalu stocks. I realli hate buy them. I also stay away from compani that have declin ROE, ROA, ROC and net profit margin as it is a sign that their moat, if they had one, is diminishing. I also hate to see a compani take on more debt that cannot be paid back within five year of free cash flow. I also stay away from compani that bring on manag that is not shareholder-friendly. There are a lot of thing I would consid too risky, but it ha more to do with the compani specifically, not just an entir industry. Lastly, I do not invest in Chines compani as it well document they have veri loos law when it come to accur report account data.10. What are some invest lesson you learn in 2016?Never get away from your invest strategi and philosophy. I am a valu investor and I have about 50 item on my invest checklist. One of the way I get idea is by copi the pros. I like to search the 13F and 13D file to see what big fund manag are buying. The costli mistak I made in 2016 wa purchasingHorsehead Holdings(ZINC). I bought it becaus three veri well-known, success hedg fund manag with a valu invest strategi bought that company. I took a shortcut and did not due my due diligence. I read all of the reason whi they bought the stock, but I did not do my own analysis. Horsehead went bankrupt. Had I run the compani through my invest checklist, I would have never have invest a penni into Horsehead. I will never make a singl invest again base on what other investor are doing, even if God happen to be buy a stock. I will continu to copi idea from the big success money managers, but I will alway run it through my invest checklist befor I ever make a buy decision.11. What discount rate do you use in your valuation?Buffett say 15%, and he ha done pretti darn well for himself. Phil Town is one of my mentor and he too use a discount rate of 15%, so that is what I use.12. Which is more useful, earn yield or P/E ratio? Why?I use them both. The P/E ratio give us a realli good idea of where a compani is valu at current compar to it own histor valuations. For example,Manpower(MAN) is a great company, solid financials, low debt and so on. In June, the Brexit knock it down from $87 to $57. It histor P/E go back to 2000 is 16 and sinc 2010 it ha been slightli lower. The Brexit knock it to a P/E of 9.2. Base on it own history, that wa one of the best time to enter into a position. It quickli rebound from $60 to $100 sinc June. The P/E valuat wa one of the main piec of inform we use to valu it becaus Manpow is a simpl company.P/ doe have it shortcom however. It doe not account for potenti futur growth or exist debt, so it cannot be the onli tool in our toolbox. I do like to use earn yield, which for those who do not know what that is, it is the invers of the P/E ratio. Earn divid by current stock price. I want to see thi at 10% or higher. A higher earn yield mean the compani is earn more rel to the price you are pay for it. At the veri least, the earn yield ha to be two time the 10-year treasuri yield or els it is not worth take the risk invest in that company13. With just public information, how can you be confid that your valuat is correct while the market is wrong?I do not pay attent to the entir market too much, especi the ""experts"" anymore. I have seen way too mani analyst recommend a buy after the stock ha fulli appreciated, and I have seen them recommend a sell after it ha bottom out. I see it too often, so I do not pay attent to them anymore. I have no clue how they come up with their buy and sell recommendations. Also, the invest public is veri emotional. Therefore, they react to news event base on fear rather than reason. Or as Buffett call it, Mr. Market, who is ration most of the time but occasion get overli depress or overli exuberant. I base my decis on the calcul I have been use success for years. That prevent me from get my emot involv in my invest decisions. I use those time where Mr. Market get depress as opportun to get in at a discount.14. What are the key attribut of a great investor?Th key attribut would be to stay disciplined. Do not jump chase strategies. Find one that fit your need and stick with it. Next, I would say to stay unemotional. Let your analysi tell you if you should buy or sell. Never let your emot make your decis for you. Lastly, never ever stop learning. Alway read. Buffett read 500 page a day-that is how knowledg build up. Alway tri to learn someth new that will make your invest skill better. Read the news, read books, attend invest confer and take invest cours or classes. If you just learn one new thing from ani of the above, it will pay for the financi cost and time cost of get that educ tenfold.15. What are the best book about special situat investing?Ther is a ton of great inform on thi subject in Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio)' book, ""You Can Be a Stock Market Genius"". It is a weird title, but definit one of the best invest book you will ever read. He talk about special situat a lot in thi book. He cover situat such as mergers, spinoffs, restructur and recapitalizations, to name a few.16. What skill are need to succeed in distress debt or special situat investing?I wish I could answer your question about distress debt. That is not my area of expertise. I do not invest in distress debt. As for the spinoffs, I think patienc is key. Oftentim when a compani spin off one of it smaller businesses, you will eventu see some selling. For example, if a large-cap compani spin off one of it entities, that entiti may be a smaller cap company. A large-cap mutual fund cannot hold that as a posit in their fund becaus it doe not meet the criteria of what the manag can invest in. Therefore, the large-cap fund that hold that spun-off compani will sell those shares. Thi sell will happen a month or two after the spinoff, sometim longer. Wait for that selloff, and if the compani is a great busi that fit your strategy, your patienc can pay off onc the sell ha subsided.17. What are the best websit to follow for valu investing-ori invest ideas?In no particular order, the valu invest site I use all the time are ruleoneinvesting.com, gurufocus.com, oldschoolvalue.com, valuewalk.com and wallstreetvalue.com.18. Who are the best valu investor in the U.S. with under $1 billion in capital?Phil Town is one who I would recommend veri closely. He ha a great track record, and that can be found on AAII.com. He teach a lot of hi techniqu at hi free three-day seminar in Atlanta. I also follow Mohnish Pabrai (Trades, Portfolio). He ha under $500 million in asset under manag accord to GuruFocus.19. What are the best mutual fund for valu investors?I do not recommend mutual funds. They charg unnecessari fees. If you read the prospectu or go to the fee and expens tab on Morningstar.com, you will notic the intern fee are too high to justifi paying. You pay a manag fee, expens ratio, 12-B 1 fee and more. John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, said the averag fee on a mutual fund is over 2% annually. If you want to invest in a diversifi fund, I would go with a low-cost exchang trade fund, also known as an ETF. The intern fee are closer to 0.1% to 0.4% annually. If you are go to invest in an ETF, I would look at the Vanguard funds. They have incred low fee and mani of their ETF are four and five-star rate on Morningstar. I would also look at the Berkshir Hathaway B share if you want to piggyback off of Buffett without fork over a quarter million dollar for one share.20. For an individu rel unsophist non-profession investor, what are the most under-valu asset class today and what are the best fund or mechan to invest in them with a buy and hold mentality?A great way to find potenti undervalu compani for a novic investor would be to go to the librari and look at Valu Line. It free at the libraries, otherwis you pay $500 for the same thing without go to the library. One of the report publish in it invest survey is the in favor and out of favor sectors. Take a look at the out of favor sector and find the industri leader in that sector or sectors. That could be a sourc for a hand of compani that may be undervalu simpli becaus their industri is out of favor.Also see if your librari ha a Morningstar.com subscription. If so, they have a screener for four and five-star rate stocks. The star rate have absolut noth to do with the qualiti of the business, but it rank pure on what their analyst think are undervalu companies. Four-star rate compani are undervalu and five-star rate compani are veri undervalued. Most are undervalu for a reason, becaus the busi are junk, but there are alway a few in there that are potenti gems.A for buy and hold, Buffett prefer never selling. Sometim if a compani becom too overvalued, then we are better off sell and then get back into the compani onc it at a bargain price again. For a quick lesson on a few basic way to valu a stock, watch some of the free video on GuruFocus, read the blog on ruleoneinvesting.com and I will also start post some content on valuat on my Twitter accounts, @vilord and @wallstreetvalue.Start afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

As Shopifi expand globally, a $57 billion total address market is possible. In 2016, it revenu grew to $389 million, which is a small portion of what' possibl for the company.Foolish bottom lineShopify' success is tie to that of the entrepreneur on it platform and that the compani continu to develop addit capabl for it customers.

On the surface, it sound like a solid upgrade, with a faster CPU than the age Air 2 and a $70 price drop.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleLook deeper, though, and AAPL' consum tablet strategi is a littl more calcul than ""faster and cheaper.""New iPad is Faster Than iPad Air 2, But …Apple' age iPad Air 2 wa releas in 2014 and power by the A8X chip. While blaze fast at the time of it release, it' get a littl pokey now, especi with processor-intens app like games.Th new iPad that Appl announc on March 21 is equip with the A9 CPU, which first show up in the iPhon 6S in 2015. Accord to AAPL, the A9 repres a signific 70% process boost and 90% graphic improv over it previou gener chip. So the iPad should see a consider perform improv over the iPad Air 2 it replaces.However, a closer look at the spec show that the new iPad is actual thicker and heavier than the model it replaces.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashConsid the big deal that Appl typic make about it tablet get thinner with everi generation, an upgrad that mean go from 6.1mm thick and 0.96 pound to 7.5mm thick and 1.03 pound might be off-putting. Especi for those consum who have upgrad everi year to ensur they have the best iPad, watch each new purchas get progress thinner and lighter.Mor problemat than the size is the display. The new iPad ha a high resolut Retina display, but it lose the lamin and anti-reflect coat the iPad Air 2 featured. Thi is a step backward and asTh Vergepoint out, for those who use a tablet primarili to read or watch movies,th old iPad Air 2 with it superior display is go to offer a better user experience.New iPad is Cheaper Than iPad Air 2, But…Competitor likeAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have hammer at consum tablet prices. Appl is set the entri price for it full-sized, new iPad at $329. That' consider less than the $399 iPad Air 2 it replaces, although still pretti far from Amazon' $49.99 Fire Tablet.However, the new iPad actual ha the effect ofraisingth minimum amount need to buy a new iPad from Apple.How doe thi math work?It' not the iPad itself, the issu is that when AAPL introduc the new model, it not onli drop the iPad Air 2, it also drop the iPad Mini 2. As a result, the cheapest tablet current offer by Appl is that new iPad at $329, instead of the iPad Mini 2 at $269.So Who Is the New iPad Aim At?Apple' consum iPad strategi seem a littl confus at the moment.AppleInsiderha a theori that make sense, though. It suggeststh iPad isn't aim at iPad Air 2 ownersso much as it' intend to convinc the 30% of iPad owner that still own second-, third- and fourth-gener model to upgrade.Mani peopl have been hold onto these older iPad (releas from 2011 through 2012) becaus they'r ""good enough"" and an upgrad wa too expensive. But they don't run current softwar and their batteri will be failing. They also lack Touch-ID, which the new iPad offers. The new model will be a seriou upgrad for these hold-outs, and even in it chunkier form factor it will be much lighter and thinner than what they current own.Appl Inc. Launch New Red iPhon 7, New iPadTh $329 price for a full-sized, current gener iPad may be enough entic to push them to open their wallets.What about iPad Air 2 owners? Those who just want a more powerful, full-siz tablet can upgrad to the new iPad. Those who want a speed boost without give up display qualiti or the sleek form factor they'r accustom to will be steer to the more expens 9.7-inch iPad Pro.That still leav bargain tablet shopper out of the picture, but AAPL wa never go after that demographic. The $269 iPad Mini 2 wa an attempt to offer an afford tablet and the $329 iPad now fill that slot. If the higher price tag scare away a few shopper so be it.It seem more like that it' that big group of older iPad owner AAPL is realli go after, along with ani tablet shopper look for a premium - yet rel afford - Appl experience.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Mutual Fund You Can Buy and Hold Forever10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashSear Hold Corp (SHLD) Admit It' a Giant Tire FireTh postTh New Appl Inc. iPad Strategi Is Sneakier Than You Thinkappear first onInvestorPlace."

Ford and GM simpli never figur out how to profit make smaller car (with those labor cost a key reason why). But fuel economi rule requir Ford and Gener Motor to make those smaller car - at a loss - in order to sell profit truck and SUVs.With the Donald Trump Administr reportedli reconsid environment regul on the industry, there have been hope that GM stock and Ford stock could benefit from changes. And there is some logic behind those hopes.Wher Ford Stock and GM Stock Sit NowObviously, it' not the financi crisi anymore. GM stock ha been recapit and return to the public markets. Ford stock hasn't exactli soar sinc a post-crisi rebound, but it ha been steady, and both stock have paid substanti dividend along the way.10 Small-Cap Stock That Could Doubl in the Next 3 MonthsChrysl - which also went bankrupt in 2009 - ha becom part ofFiat Chrysler Automobil NV(NYSE:FCAU), a stock that ha roar sinc the election.But FCAU asid - and that stock hasn't had huge upsid on a long-term basi - automot stock haven't perform all that well. And the small car problem persist - and now extend to electr cars. GM reportedlylos $9,000 per caron sale of it Chevrolet Bolt EV. Fiat' 500e sell ata $14,000 loss. Tax credit may offset some of the impact, and higher product and scale could improv margin eventually. But the drag from CAFE and other standard continu for U.S. manufacturers.Unsurprisingly, both Ford and GM trade at veri low earn multiples. GM stock trade at about 6x earnings. Ford stock is valu at just over 7x it estim 2017 profit.Short-term concern about peak U.S. auto sale - after the post-crisi rebound - are one driver. Longer-term concern about self-driv car - which would notic limit demand - are another. But in those earn is embed an indirect tax paid by owner of Ford stock and GM stock for fuel-economi standards. And lately, it seem possibl those standard might change.Trump' Review and It Impact on Ford and Gener MotorsTher are two possibl chang that have come to light in the last week. The more well-cov wa when Presid Trump himself said last week that the govern would review 'mid-term' fuel economi standards, requir to be met from 2022 to 2025. Accord toBusi Insider, automot industri representatives, as well as GM CEO Mari Barra and Ford CEO Mark Fields, have push back against the higher standard required.Whatev the impact on an environment or social basis, a reduct in those standard would be good news for both F stock and GM stock.To be sure, such a move isn't guaranteed. But the new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is a notabl skeptic toward climat change. Meanwhile, Trump Administr prioriti seem skew toward jobs. If the Big Three can make the case that a rollback of those standard would help sale - and protect U.S. job - they will find a will audience. The abil to sell more larger - and more profit - car could help earn in the next decade.Befor that, it would improv sentiment toward Ford and GM stock.California' WaiverTh second potenti catalyst is a bit more hidden. Under the origin Clean Air Act, the state of California wa grant a waiver from feder legislation. That state can - and doe - requir far more stringent regul on tailpip pollution. Other state are allow to follow as well.Thos regul - origin design to target smog - add cost to everi vehicl sold under California standards. And the state now is push for faster adopt of electr cars. That would forc Ford, Gener Motors, and other manufactur to sell more unprofit electr car to allow for profit sale of truck and SUVs.That waiver may be at risk, however. Pruittreportedlyi look for a way to withdraw that waiver. And that would be a substanti game-chang for both F stock and GM stock. It would remov the addit cost of make two version of each vehicl for U.S. markets. It would mitig electr car risk. Both factor like would improv margin - and profit - for both Ford and Gener Motors.Whi Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Trump Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Again, the environment and social impact of these discuss is up for debate. But from an invest perspective, both F and GM look extrem cheap - and price in a number of risks.It' worth consid what might happen if one of those risk wa removed, or at least mitig for the time being. With both Ford and Gener Motor at single-digit multiples, it' hard to imagin the stocks, in that scenario, would go anywher but up.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin had no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Futur Blue-Chip Stock You Need to Buy7 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are Actual SafeTh postTrump' EPA Polici Could Help Ford Motor Compani (F) and Gener Motor Compani (GM)appear first onInvestorPlace."

FANG Stocks are Back in Focus;3/22/2017;"A while ago someon notic that if you took the first letter of the name of the four big modern tech companies, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Googl (GOOG:GOOGL) they spell out a wonder acronym, FANG. Of course, sinc then Googl ha gone and spoil it all by rebrand their hold compani as alphabet, but the acronym ha stuck.At the risk of spoil that alphabet synergi I would add Appl (AAPL) to the list, given that compani role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some peopl substitut Appl for Amazon and obvious if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appeal FAANG. For argument’ sake, let’ assum that all five stock are still collect known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.Th reason, though, is less about tech, or inde about busi at all, than it is about politics. The market seem to be driven at the moment by what come out of the White House. Sinc the elect there ha been a lot of faith place by trader and investor in certain polici outlin by the new administr and the Republican who domin Congress dure the campaign; a “beautiful” replac for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructur spending.makeArticleAd();Yesterday’ drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, wa reportedli trigger by worri about the healthcar bill slate to replac the Afford Care Act. It ha met with opposit from within the Republican Party, particularli from the Right, and need some seriou negoti in order to just pass the House.That in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replac passed, as most acknowledg that someth ha to fill the vacuum.Mor worri for the market, though, is that if thi bill fails, it will indic that the fiscal conserv in Congress are stick to their principles, make stimul infrastructur spend a virtual non-starter.Som of the biggest loser yesterday were in the industri and materi sector that have gain the most sinc the elect and which would be hurt most by delay in infrastructur spending. The reason the fang stock look so attract right now is becaus polici delay regard healthcar and infrastructur spend will have littl effect on them in the short term, but thing like tax reform when it doe come, especi the possibl of the repatri of oversea profits, will make an enorm difference. The consensu is that tax reform is an area that unit the parti and thu could be even hasten by a split over the Obamacar replacement.Th fli in the ointment could be that much of the potenti growth for these firm lie in oversea expansion, in particular to emerg economies. That would be a worri if the White Hous doe push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucu free market type in the GOP are flex their muscl would suggest that ani eventu move would have to be negotiated, and therefor moder from the campaign rhetoric.Al in all, then, thing look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seem to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five ha buck the downward trend of the broader market and gain in earli trading. Of cours one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refut and they may prove to be a hedg against polit driven uncertainti over the next few weeks, or even months."

Note to self: see if Dan is look for research partner in thi ocean of data.Follow of my stock research and trade articl know that I often talk about The GAF Economi compris of Google, Amazon, and Facebook. My focu is on the behemoth who have chang our entertainment, education, shop and entrepreneurship with a digit delug of inform and market opportunities.Together, Googl and Facebook will break the $100 billion mark thi year in advertis revenu accord to market research firm eMarketer. Googl broke the $50 billion mark a few year ago and Facebook top $26 billion in 2016.Their combin 2017 haul will command over a 46% share of advertisers' total global digit ad spend. Just think about the volum of consum purchas trigger by that $100 billion in ad spend.And if you have been listen to me about digit advertis growth in the past year, you know that Facebook is not steal market share from Googl in that growth. Together, they are expand the pie as ton of small and medium-s busi realiz the power of digitally-target audienc and geographies, effici ad testing, and fine-tun of their ad budgets.Welcom to the JungleAnd in the ""retail rainforest"" that is Amazon, consum continu to adopt it conveni platform for more purchas -- at the expens of tradit retailers. Amazon' total annual revenu grew 27% last year to $136 billion as it wa respons for possibl one-fourth of all onlin transact in the US.Testifi to that reach, accord to web market servic provid BloomReach, 55% of consum start their product search on Amazon in 2016, up from 44% in 2015.And here are some amaz stat from Amazon' Q4 report...Fulfil by Amazon (FBA) deliv more than two billion unit on behalf of seller in 2016, and the number of activ seller use FBA grew more than 70%. Use the FBA service, Amazon seller from more than 130 countri fulfil order to custom in 185 countries.In 2016, there were over 100,000 seller with sale of more than $100,000 sell on Amazon.To help put Amazon' share of retail sale in some perspect - I say ""some"" becaus the compani doesn't break out their revenu clearli enough for us to know for sure -- let me share some paragraph from an Octob USA Today articl titledAmazon could be a lot bigger than we think...In the Unit States, total annual retail sale are about $5 trillion, with the Depart of Commerc estim 8% of that is e-commerce. That put total onlin sale at around $400 billion, and Amazon' share at 15% (for domest revenu only).Amazon' retail revenue, however, doesn't reflect the full valu of the item sold on Amazon by other retailers. These are compani that use Amazon as an onlin sale venue, sometim their onli one. Amazon say 49% of it unit sold come from third-parti sellers.Th compani may actual be handl doubl that amount - 20% to 30% of all U.S. retail good sold onlin - thank to the volum of sale it transact for third parti on it websit and app. Onli a portion of those sale add to it revenue.""Th punchlin is that Amazon' twice as big as peopl give them credit for, becaus there' thi iceberg under the surface, but you onli see the tip,"" said Scot Wingo, execut chairman of Channel Advisor, an e-commerc softwar compani that work with thousand of onlin sellers.When third-parti sale are taken into account, Amazon' share of what U.S. shopper spend onlin could be as high as $125 billion yearly, and it could repres close to 30% of the onlin good American buy, accord to an analysi of Amazon' financi statements.Gen Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray, estim Amazon touch 30% of total e-commerc in the Unit States, and it share is growing.""Amazon' just go to slowli grab more and more of your wallet,"" he said.Again, Dan Ari if you are listening, we need to studi the buy data and behavior of the GAF Economy.

(AMZN) Stock Could Be Finance;3/22/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsPeopl are alway on the lookout for the next industryAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) ha in it crosshairs, and some think financ might be next. After all, Amazon stock' Chines counterpart,Alibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) spearhead a digit financ revolut in China through it payment arm, Alipay.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBank look at AMZN with a degre of trepidation; the behemoth ha alreadi disrupt everyth from retail to entertain to shipping.When Amazon enter an industry, it move fast and it is will to oper at razor-thin margin to grow market share. AMZN stock take no prisoners, and the compani is respons for much of the pain felt today by brick-and-mortar retail such asJ C Penney Compani Inc(NYSE:JCP) andSear Hold Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD).Bank know that tech compani like Amazon andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) hold some advantages. Millenni are more like totrusttech compani than banks. Also, tech compani can oper at lower cost than banks, sinc they don't have branches. AMcKinsey reportfound that the lack of branch give fintech lender a 400-basis-point advantag over banks. Tech giant also have lowercustom acquisit costsand greater digit compet than banks.It look like Amazon stock is deepen it involv in finance. AMZN alreadi began offeringloan to sellerson it onlin marketplac in 2012, and expand thi toeight more countries, includ Germani and China, in 2015. And Amazon roll out a payment servic in 2013, which doubl intransact valuein 2016 and reach 33 million customers.In the near-term, it look like AMZN stock will focu on do two things: build it payment system and cross-sel financi product from bank to it million of users.10 Small-Cap Stock That Could Doubl in the Next 3 MonthsIn the long-term, Amazon stock could end up as a major forc in finance. AsHuy Nguyen Trieu, a fintech expert and former Citi MD, writes: ""the tech giant such as Amazon, Googl or Appl will continu their expans into financi servic and are like to play an import role in the financi ecosystem - in the same way that Alibaba ha done in China.""Th ventur capitalistAlex Rampellse Amazon succeed in financ as well. Alphabet,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), earn high margin from monet data or sell comput products, and thi mightdet them from enter finance. However, AMZN stock doe not fear low-margin businesses.Wil Amazon Stock Domin the Payment Game?Currently,Payp Hold Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) domin onlin payment in the Unit States, with200 million activ accountsworldwide. The number of PayPal user dwarf those of Amazon Payment by a factor of six. PayPal also hold an advantag over Amazon Pay in that other retail such asWal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT)do not want to take Amazon Pay, fear that the data might give Amazon a competit advantage. PayPal, on the other hand, is just a payment service, and doesn't compet with retail like Walmart.Currently, Amazon and PayPal arein talksto allow user to pay with PayPal on Amazon. Amazon' competitoreBay Inc(NASDAQ:EBAY) own PayPal until the twosplitin 2015. Now, the two are free to work together.And the two will bothbenefit. Thi would increas PayPal' presenc and drive busi for PayPal, which ha been absent from Amazon. And infrequ AMZN user might not want to put down a credit card on the site, so ad PayPal reduc friction.But the truce between Amazon stock and PayPal might not last forever. AMZN could licens it next-gener Amazon Go store technolog to brick-and-mortar retail in exchang for them allow Amazon Pay.AsAndrew Melvillenot in Forbes:""Few retailers, even those worri about competit from Amazon, would be abl to declin a free next-gener technolog that would transform the custom experience, reduc theft, and allow for major reduct in labor - the second largest expens in retail. And no payment compani would be abl to offer retail anyth even remot like Amazon Go' technology.""Mor groceri store might then accept payment via Amazon Pay, help AMZN' mobil wallet gain critic mass. And, asAlipayha shown in China, onc Amazon gain ground in payments, it can build a broader internet financ ecosystem.AMZN Stock: Opportun for Cross-Sel Financi ProductsAmazon could also partner with bank to provid it user with financi servic such as loans.Last year, AMZN partner withWel Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) to offerstud loansat discount rate to Amazon Student Prime subscribers. Student Prime subscrib could get a 0.5% discount on loans. However, Amazon quickli end thi amidpubl pressurefrom consum watchdogs.Privaci Revamp Make Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More AttractiveThi January, Amazon announc the newAmazon Prime Reward Visa Signaturecredit card, issu throughJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM). Thi card give custom 5% cashback on purchas from AMZN and elimin fee for foreign transactions. Thi further encourag shop on Amazon and make Prime membership more attractive, while give Chaseincomefrom transactions.Amazon and the BanksIt look like the relationship between AMZN stock and the bank will be complicated. In some areas, Amazon and the bank will be partners, with bank issu financi product sold on it websit to Prime subscribers. At the same time, AMZN will be a supplier to the banks, provid them with cloud servic viaAmazon Web Services.In other cases, they may end up as competitors. Mobil wallet such as Amazon Pay could potenti replac credit cards, and depriv bank of payment revenu anddataon custom spend patterns.And in these partnerships, who would have the upper hand? bank or Amazon stock? Remember, AMZN would be interact directli with custom and hold the user data.Although the relationship between tech compani and bank is nuanced,banksstil have reason to be concerned.A of writing, Luca Hahn did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-Hot7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeTh postWhi the Next Frontier for Amazon.com, Inc.

For starters, it doe repres 17% of the US economy. But the other reason is that the tax cut are in queue after the health care initi pass. So ani delay in the health care stuff, could delay the tax stuff, which is what the market is most bullish on. I don't think either one is in jeopardy.""But like above, the market wa look for an excus to pull back some and thi wa a built in excus to do so.

3 Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy in a Bull Market;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn of the largest risk to short in a bull market is face a short squeeze. And one of the better trade opportun in find stock to buy in a bull market is to look for those potenti short squeezes.makeArticleAd();Admittedly, it doesn't entirelyfeellik a bull market at the moment. Stock aren't exactli soar everi day. Even the 11-day win streak post by theDow Jone Industri Averagewa compris mostli of middl gains.But we are at all-tim high in the broad market, and econom indic are flash green, as the old say goes.Consumers, homebuild and CEO alik are more confident. The Feder Reserv is rais rates, see enough econom strength to accommod potenti higher interest expense. It certainli seem as if there could be more room to run in a stock market ralli that ha last the better part of eight year now.10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotIf that' the case, short seller could face some pressure, particularli in these three stocks.Short-Squeez Stock to Buy: Wayfair Inc (W)Wayfair Inc(NYSE:W) might seem like an odd choic for thi list, given a still sky-high valuation. And Wayfair isn't profit yet, even on an Adjust EBITDA basis.Pur from a valuat standpoint, it' not surpris short seller have target Wayfair. A $3.3 billion market cap for an unprofit compani is alway go to draw detractors.But I'm not sure W stock is all that overvalu to begin with. The stock trade at under 1x sale on an enterpris basis. Direct retail revenu grew a whop 60% in 2016. The intern busi is gain traction as well.And if you look at result of tradit furnitur retailers, likeEthan Allen Interior Inc.(NYSE:ETH),RH(NYSE:RH) andLa-Z-Boy Incorporated(NYSE:LZB), there ha been substanti weak on the top line of late. It' hard not to draw the conclus that Wayfair' $3 billion-plu in revenu is come from those companies.Meanwhile, a high-growth, onlin furnitur retail sound exactli like the type macro-bullish stock investor would target when look for stock to buy. With over 25% of the float sold short, W look like a classic short squeez opportunity.Short-Squeez Stock to Buy: Chegg Inc (CHGG)Part of the issu withChegg Inc(NYSE:CHGG) is that the market doesn't entir understand the story.Simpli look at the busi appear to show a scream short target. Chegg is modestli profit on an EBITDA basis, but trade at about 32x that EBITDA and is post GAAP losses. Meanwhile, revenuedeclined16% in 2016.But revenu figur are color by a shift in Chegg' busi model. The compani ha outsourc it textbook rental business, mean it record onli commiss as revenu rather than the full cost of the rental. That shift ha freed up cash, and allow the compani to invest in it fast-grow onlin portal for colleg and high school students.7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeCHGG remain a high-risk stock, but there is an intrigu stori here, and the potenti for industri dominance.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) often ha been rumor as an acquir for the company. In the meantime, a 21% short float figur and the potenti for a strong, season important, first quarter set CHGG up nice for a short squeeze.Short-Squeez Stock to Buy: Twilio Inc (TWLO)Twilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock admittedli got well ahead of itself after it IPO in June of last year. TWLO stock wa price at $15, open at $24, and close near $29 on it first day of trading.Bi late September, TWLO wa abov $70. A swift 50%+ declin soon followed, but Twilio stock ha settl down sinc into a rang (mostly) between $30 and $35.Like W, TWLO stock isn't cheap: the stock trade at almost 7x revenu on an enterpris basis, and Twilio isn't profitable. But the stock remainsa danger short, as I argu last month.Similar high-fli cloud stock have defi gravity, and burn short sellers, for some time.Workday Inc(NYSE:WDAY) trade at 10x revenue. Short have been targetingVeeva System Inc(NYSE:VEEV) for some time, and that stock is up ~150% sinc last January, and trade at an all-tim high.Twilio ha a huge opportun in cloud communications, and as long as revenu growth cooperates, TWLO' valuat can stay elevated. And if that growth comes, and the broad market continu to rise, it seem like a short squeez of the 29% short float will follow.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Th post3 Short Squeez Stock to Buy in a Bull Marketappear first onInvestorPlace."

""And for us that' a really, realli good flywheel becaus keep our buyer insid our marketplace, it allow us to creat a new stream of monetization, and it allow our seller to buy up for promot activities.""Shift exclus to ad that promot product sold through eBay will keep shopper on it site, potenti increas gross merchandis volume. As volum increases, merchant have more incent to sell product on eBay' marketplac and advertis those product listings.Amazon made a similar move in 2015, and the growth of third-parti merchant on Amazon' marketplac is fuel it sale growth. Granted, onli a small part of that growth is due to Amazon' revamp ad platform.Imag source: eBay.Bett data for advertisingeBay and Amazon have some of the best data for advertising.

And, eBay say it user spend 200 million hour search and brows it websit everi month.Thi data can make the onlin marketplace' platform more attract than Facebook or Googl for lucr product ads. eBay even argu it' more attract than Amazon becaus it ""offer full data transpar about advertisers' products"" on it marketplace.eBay also doesn't sell ani product directly, which could encourag merchant to favor it platform over Amazon's. Not onli doe Amazon sell good itself, it ha an increasingli broad rang of privat label with which it can significantli undercut compet products' pricing.How big is the opportunity?Th digit advertis space is massive. Googl and Facebook are certainli domin forces, rake in a combin $86.5 billion last year. But eMarket estim there wa anoth $108 billion split among the rest of the crowd. By 2020, digit ad sale will reach $320 billion, accord to the research group.Aft a full year of make chang to it advertis business, Amazon saw it other incom segment (which includ advertis and credit card agreements) grow 81% in the fourth quarter. While Amazon onli brought in $1.3 billion in other incom last year, it' stilla huge opportunityfor the company.eBay' recent move echo Amazon's, and provid a similar opportunity. Given it ad busi is alreadi compar in size to Amazon's, that' a good start.

The deal enabl Airtel and Videocon DTH custom to stream Netflix content as the compani will integr the app right into their set-top boxes, elimin the need for ani mobil devic or smart television.Of course, the set-top box need to be connect to the internet through a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network, and it need a minimum speed of 2 Mbps, but thi shouldn't be a problem for Netflix. India' averag internet speed shot up to 5.6 Mbp in the fourth quarter of 2016, from just 3.5 Mbp toward the begin of the year, thank to the grow deploy of fiber network and LTE.Additionally, the broadband user count there is slate to hit 600 million in the next three year as compar to 100 million in 2015, driven by govern initi to promot digitization. Thi is great news for Netflix sinc improv internet speed and penetr will increas pay-TV adopt in thi market.Accord to the Asia Pacif Pay TV Forecasts, India will add 30 million pay-TV subscrib in the next five years. Netflix, therefore, ha done the right thing by partner with two of the largest DTH compani in the Indian market sinc it will now have readi access to a huge user base. There is no clariti on the price plan yet, but if Netflix can share the cost with it DTH partner or run ads, it might be abl to offer lower, cheaper plan to drive subscriptions.Digit payment could be anoth tailwindNetflix ha primarili accept credit card so far in India, and thi ha been detriment to it growth sinc credit card penetr over there is abysm low.

NVIDIA Corporation's New GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Is Selling Out;3/21/2017;"Earlier thi month, graphic specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) launch it next-gener flagship game graphic processor call the GeForc GTX 1080 Ti. The 1080 Ti is in mani way like the NVIDIA Titan X that the compani launch last summer, but with a few modif that allow it to be both cheaper than the former ($1,200 versu $699) as well as slightli better perform (independ third-parti review show the 1080 Ti averag 2% better perform than the Titan X in 4K gaming).Although it' still earli on in thi product' life cycl -- NVIDIA' flagship graphic processor tend to stay flagship for about a year -- it look like earli demand for the product is outstrip supply.makeArticleAd();Imag source: NVIDIA.Sold out everywhereTh first wave of graphic card base on the GeForc GTX 1080 Ti graphic processor -- NVIDIA' own ""Founder Edition"" model -- seem to be sold out all over. They'r out of stock on popular onlin comput hardwar resel Newegg.com and on NVIDIA' own website, and onli appear to be avail through third-parti resel onAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) at price well abov MSRP.Where' the bottleneck?What' interest is that the 1080 Ti isn't base on a brand-new chip that NVIDIA onli just recent began ramp into product -- but rather on the same chip, call GP102, that power the Titan X as well as NVIDIA' Quadro P6000 profession visual and Tesla P40 high-perform comput acceler cards.That chip ha been roll off the product line for a while now and is manufactur inTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company's(NYSE: TSM) matur 16-nanomet FinFET+ technology, so I'd be surpris if NVIDIA is have processor suppli issues.Th actual add-in-board design (i.e., the board upon which the chip and memori are mount and the cool solution) should also be made up of compon like the one that NVIDIA ha had in product for quit a while in support of it GeForc GTX 1080 and Titan X add-in-boards, so I don't see the board itself be a potenti product bottleneck.What could be limit initi suppli -- on top of what is probabl solid demand for the GPU itself, given it attract price/perform characterist -- and help to drive thi appar supply/demand imbal is the fact that the 1080 Ti use a new speed grade of a memori type known as GDDR5X. The 1080 and the Titan X use GDDR5X graphic memori fromMicron(NASDAQ: MU) that offer transfer rate of 10 gigabit per second (that' 10 billion bit per second). Micron ha been manufactur that memori type for a while and so I'd imagin that the compani can produc them at high volum with reason manufactur yield at thi point.Th 1080 Ti, on the other hand, use a new speed grade of GDDR5X from Micron, rate at 11 gigabit per second (10% faster). Thi new speed grade, which realli repres the bleed edg of graphic memori technology, is almost certainli harder to manufactur than the slower stuff use in the 1080 Ti that may be the bottleneck initi 1080 Ti supply.If that' the case, I'd expect 1080 Ti suppli to eas up as Micron run more GDDR5X wafer and get better at manufactur the higher speed grades.Find out whi Nvidiai one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on March 10, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Welcom toIndustri Focus, the podcast that dive into a differ sector of the stock market everi day. It' Friday, March 10, and we'r talk tech and the peril of short a stock. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join in the studio by Motley Fool Premium analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how' it going?Jason Moser:Hello, sir. All right, how are you?Lewis:Work on get over a cold.Moser:Y and me both.Lewis:Yeah. We'r go to tri to make it through thi episod without hacking. I pick the perfect person to be on.Moser:We'r go to have to. Thi is go to take doubl effort here.Lewis:Y have a littl mug of tea.Moser:I do. I figur thi helps. I thought it would be coffee, but I think coffe actual dehydr you a littl bit, oddli enough. It' mostli water, but appar it' not good for you.Lewis:Yeah, tea is a much better option.Moser:Yeah, that' what I'm understanding, and so far it' working, so let' hope it lasts.Lewis:So, listeners, pleas excus ani huge cough fits. I have a 32-ounc bottl of water next to me as we do thi show. We'r go to tri to make it through, though. But after our episod last week, Snap and the morn after, we talk about the market reaction to Snap' IPO. We got an email from one of our listeners, thi guy Chris, and he asked, ""Dylan said that the risk from short could be catastrophic. How and whi can short have more potenti for catastroph loss than buy into a company?"" We wound up get a similar-ish question on The Motley Fool podcastsFacebookgroup, which is awesome, if anyon isn't a part of that, check it out. We bounc idea back and forth; it' a great place to connect with the cast and other Fool that are interest in the podcast. Just a plug.Moser:Mak fun of peopl on the podcast. Bill Barker is a subject of joke there.Lewis:Yeah, he get jab two decent amount. But, someon in that group also rais someth similar with the idea of potenti short Snap. I love it when peopl drop these kind of questions, becaus it give us a great len into what peopl are think about the market, and what they want address on the show. So, I figur that we would tackl thi topic, talk a littl bit broadli about shorting. We'v talk Snap to death at thi point, I think we'v done two out of the last fourTechepisod about it. So we'll tri to keep it away from Snap and mostli just about the mechan of shorting, and the pitfal that peopl need to be awar of. But, I think, befor we get too much into the downside, we should walk through some of the mechan of short itself, and what you'r realli do when you'r short a stock.Moser:Yeah. Short a stock, first and foremost, is basic place a bet on it demise. You'r bet against it. Normally, what we do so much of here is recommend that peopl buy stocks, and we think those are go to be good invest for the long haul, they will appreci in value. When you short a stock, you'r basic bet that stock is go to fall or depreci in value. There could be ani number of reason you short, but ultimately, you'r basic borrow a stock from your broker, sell it to someon els at a given price, and then at some point, you'r go to need to buy it back and return it to the broker. So, if you short a stock, then ideally, you want to see the price go down after you short it, so you would be abl to buy it back at a lower price. You get to pocket the difference.I think the biggest problem I have with shorting, and to the question that the listen wa asking, is, if you think about it: When you buy share of a company, when you invest on the long side, the veri worst case scenario is you lose all of your money. So if you invest $1,000 in compani XYZ and compani XYZ goe bankrupt, you might lose your $1,000. And that sucks, no one want to do that. But that' the downside. It' quantifiable. The thing with short the stock is, you can lose a lot more than 100% of your money. You short a stock XYZ at $100 a share and then XYZ take off and six month later it' $500 a share, well, you'r stuck, you'v lost a lot more than 100% of your money. I think that' probabl the scariest part, to me, about shorting. There' far more downsid than if you were just go to buy share of a compani and hold on to them as a long investor, like we do.Lewis:Yeah, I think the best way to think about it is, you take the upside-downsid of go long and flip it. That' basic what you'r look at. As a super basic exampl here -- and a lot of what we'r go to be talk about on thi show is basic shorting, not work with ani option in addit to a short position, just to keep thing simple. But, say you borrow one share at $10, you'r sell it immediately. $10 get deposit into your margin account. Then you have one of two scenario play out. Say share are at $7 a week later, at which point you would probabl buy a share and then return it to your brokerage, pocket the $3, mayb minu ani fee or anyth like that. Scenario B, share are at $13 a week later, in which case you'll probabl get a call from your brokerag saying, ""We need you to put more money into thi margin account to cover the losses, becaus right now you can't do that with onli the $10 that is current in your account.""Moser:Yeah, and that' a good point. A lot of thi stuff is out of your control at some point, maybe. When you'r borrow those share to then sell them off to someon else, you can't just do that for as long as you want to do it. There are a lot of other factor at play that could dictat what you have to do at some point in the future. Wherea you could buy share ofAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) tomorrow and hang on to them for the next 20 year if you want, and nobodi can take it away from you unless it' taken privat or acquir by someon else, and, obviously, that' not like to happen. But with shorting, it seem like you don't have the same freedom there.Lewis:I think one of the other danger that we see with short is thi idea of get a margin call, and be in thi posit where you'v alreadi made that initi bet, and then you'r go to have to decid whether or not you want to keep go at it and keep bank on that short posit and that thesi against that company, or if you ultim want to buy share at the market price, which is abov your position, and just eat the losses.In that second example, if you decid not to put more money in your margin account, basically, you'd wind up buy share back at the market price, which would be $13, and you would close out the posit and eat the $3. Of course, you could put more money in your margin account, and share could go up to $15 or $20, and then you'r back in the same predicament. So, you could wind up in thi increment [situation]. Keep dig in the hole, and it keep get darker and darker, and dirt keep go up on the ground, but you can't see the sun.Moser:Yeah, it' funny, shorting, to me, is one of those situat where -- and I don't do it, I'll be veri clear, to me it' not worth it -- but you could be total right in theory. If you come up with a thesi as to whi to short a stock -- ""Thi company' cash flow is not as good as they report,"" or mayb you think manag is crooked, or whatev you think it is -- you could actual be total right, but there' that saying: The market can remain irrat far longer than you can remain solvent.Lewis:Which is a big concern.Moser:Yeah. At the end of the day, the market is go to have the say-so in this. To me, short a stock, you could be total right and still total lose, and there' noth you can do about it.Lewis:And to that point, in a lot of situat you'r basic pay to watch your thesi play out, becaus veri often, there' a stock loan fee associ with shorting. So, unlik when you'r long and you buy shares, and you probabl pay a commiss to buy your shares, that' it. You hold them, you hold them for as long as you want, and you can watch the stock go up and down and just enjoy the entertain there, in addit to see what goe on with your portfolio. But as you hold or maintain a short posit longer, it' go to cost you more money in fees.Moser:Yeah, you'r pay for it.Lewis:So, beyond to the margin calls, there' go to be other thing come in there and eat into what your potenti return might be.Moser:Yeah. And I mean, I like the fact that you can short stocks. I think it' a good thing for the market, and it' good for the liquid side of things, and there' plenti of big financ out there that want to short big lot of share of stocks. Whatever, that' all fine. I don't have a problem with it. I just think for individu retail investor like us, it' one thing to make a bear call on a stock, it' anoth one entir to sit there and make a bear call and decid to short it. I think, for me, I have more entertain in make the bear call and follow it. The reward is just not there for me in shorting. I'm just not feel it.Lewis:And in a basic short, your return are more or less limit to 100%. Wherea if you go long something, you can have a multi-bagger, and you'r go to be do 1,500% in return or someth like that, if you hold someth over a 10-year period and it' a realli explos growth stock. So, for the asymmetr risk you take on, the upsid isn't realli all that fantastic.Moser:No. And you mention options. There are way you could short a stock via option if you just want to buy a put or someth like that. However, if you want to util an option strategi to do it, that would at least cap your downside. But, again, you'r get into options, which is a far more esoter way of investing. Some peopl just don't prefer to do it. It requir a bit more attent and time.Lewis:That will be a follow-on episod to this, I think.Moser:Mak sure to bring Jeff Fischer for that one.Lewis:Sure, I'll be talk with Jeff Fischer or JP Bennett, I think, for that one. A coupl other thing I think are worth keep in mind here when you'r talk about short a stock, mayb reason against it, you are super-subject to realli big downsid when it come to earn surpris or M&A activity, or anyth that' black swan-y, like, say, Brexit or the U.S. elect results. It look like Brexit and the U.S. elect were go to have huge impact downward with the market. And what did we see a coupl week later? Right back up. And long term, we'v seen nice capit appreci in the equiti market.Moser:Sure, absolutely.Lewis:So, mayb a compani blow earn out of the water, and even though long term, you might be right, like you were talk about, the immedi market reaction is go to be positive, and you'r go to have to deal with it with margin call and things.Moser:Yeah. I think short is certainli more of a short-term style invest vehicle. You'r focusing, I think, on a much shorter timelin than we like to focu here as business-styl investors.Lewis:Yeah, absolutely. A coupl other thing to keep in mind: You'r gener bet against the motion of the market. You think about what' go on on a multi-year basis. The market, the S&P 500, at least, tend to climb. I don't see that chang on a multi-year basis. So, yes, while we'r look at shorter horizons, when you'r talk about short selling, it' tough when you'r go against the momentum of everything, against the grain of everything.A coupl other more nuanc element of shorting: You are on the hook for dividend that are paid out while the share are on loan, so you'll have to pay those along to the brokerage, not that you would necessarili be short a dividend-pay stock, becaus they tend to be a littl bit more stable, but that is someth to keep in mind. Additionally, if you are look at an uncov short -- so, when you don't have ani option at play, you don't own ani of the underli share in ani way -- those are treat as short-term capit gains, which is someth to keep in mind.Moser:Yes. When you have a tax bill you have to deal with in ani which way, you alway need to keep that in mind.Lewis:That doe it for the stuff I want to hit with short stocks. Anyth you want to hit, Jason?Moser:I think it' one thing to read the headlines, especi with these big IPO that come out, and that' alway go to be the bull versu bear pull out of there. I think Snap is the easiest example, butTwitter, certainly. Facebook is anoth one. Amazon is a great exampl of a busi where you'v had so mani peopl who have thought for so long, ""Thi just doesn't make ani sense, the stock is way too overvalued, they don't earn ani money,"" and it' all becaus Jeff Bezo reinvest that money into the business. Again, a good exampl of where you could have gone short on Amazon, and it would have made sens to the extent that the busi isn't produc ani real earnings. But when you dig deeper, and you understand whi it' not produc earn and what it' do and the competit posit of the business, and the opportunity, then you recogn whi the market is assign such a hefti valuat -- becaus realli they see that Amazon is look so far forward with thi big opportun in e-commerce. So, I feel for anybodi who wa short Amazon from that perspective. And I think tech in particular, it' veri difficult to go in there and make those kind of calls. I'm not say don't short, but certainly, make sure you understand everyth involv with it befor you do it, becaus I have heard from one or two investor who have come out on the bad end of that, and it' just realli sad to hear.Lewis:Yeah. You don't want to dig yourself a hole that you'r go to have troubl get out of. We talk about things, like I said, in a basic overview type format here. There' a lot more nuanc to it. I think at some point down the road, we'll probabl do someth that talk about bearish bet with options, becaus there' clearli listen appetit for that. So, listeners, you can be look out for that and expect it to be an episod at some point soon. I realiz thi is kind of a quicker episode, but we are tee up for our South by Southwest trip, so we were a littl bit busi thi week.Moser:Nice. You say ""we,"" it' you, not me. I'm go to be sit here while you guy are out there in Texas. Listen to music, eat barbecue, probabl drink a cold beer or two.Lewis:Yeah. I guess we'r also go to go to some sessions, though. You guy are go to be get some not-so-great weather here.Moser:I understand. Thank a lot, I appreci it.Lewis:[laughs] That' all to plug some of The Fool team be in Austin for South by Southwest. We'r also go to do a listener-and-memb meet up while we'r there.Moser:That'l be awesome.

But these challeng will fade over time as J&J develop or acquir new drugs, settl legal issu and the currenc cycl becom favor again.Amazon.comJ&J is a solid core hold for conserv investors, but Amazon is a great stock for investor who can stomach more volatility.

That growth boost Amazon' net earn by 292% in 2016, and analyst expect it earn to rise anoth 47% thi year.That bottom line growth enabl Amazon to use low-margin or loss-lead strategi to expand it Prime ecosystem with new services, origin video content, smart home gadgets, and autom solut -- all of which will lock in more marketplac customers.Tenc HoldingsTh Chines internet industri is a volatil one with richli valu stocks, but one stock stand out as a safe long-term play: Tencent. Tencent' WeChat is the most popular messag app in China, it market cap make it the most valuabl compani in Asia, and it game portfolio make it the biggest video game compani in the world.WeChat' mobil app. Imag source: iTunes.Tencent' WeChat ha 846 million monthli activ user (MAUs), it older QQ chat platform ha 877 million MAUs, it popular onlin gameLeagu of Legendsha over 100 million monthli activ players, and 100 million peopl play it subsidiari Supercell' game (includingClash of Clans) everi day.

Amazon Prime Is More Popular Than Netflix in This Key Market;3/20/2017;"There are more peopl use the internet in India than the entir U.S. population. Even more astonish is that India' 460 million internet user account for just about one-third of the country' entir population, and that number is grow rapidly. Internet user increas over 50% in 2015 and over 30% in 2016.India is one of the biggest opportun for ani internet-bas business, includ over-the-top stream servic such asNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) andAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video. Netflix beat Amazon into the Indian video stream market, but a recent survey show Amazon Prime is more popular than Netflix. Jefferi & Compani found 74% of subscript video on demand, or SVOD, custom subscrib to Amazon Prime while just 63% subscrib to Netflix.Importantly, both servic are more popular than local base servic such as Hotstar (5% subscribe), a subsidiari of21st Centuri Fox(NASDAQ: FOXA) . Additionally, the respons indic that at least 37% of Indian SVOD subscrib take both Amazon and Netflix. Both these thing bode well for Amazon and Netflix.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Amazon.com.Th potenti is hugeStream video is extrem popular in India. Hotstar wa name theAppleTV app of the year last year after receiv 130 million downloads. That doesn't includ the million of other peopl that watch Hotstar on their smartphones. Hotstar had a target of 100 million viewer for stream cricket match last year, and it reach 80 million by May. For reference, Netflix ha less than 100 million global subscribers.Most of those viewer don't pay anyth to stream content from Hotstar. While Hotstar doe offer a premium subscript service, mani consum are content with what' avail for free.That' the challeng for servic like Amazon and Netflix. While there' huge demand for stream servic in India, mani don't have the willing to pay veri much or anyth at all. Still, the potenti is there.Amazon is win the Indian market the same way it won everywher elseAmazon onli introduc Prime in India in Juli of last year. Prime Video didn't launch in the countri until Decemb when Amazon made it global rollout of the service. But one of the biggest contribut factor to Amazon' quick adopt among Indian is it pricing.Indian can subscrib to Amazon Prime for just 999 rupees, or $15. With the launch of Prime Video, Amazon ran a promot cut the price in half. And that' for full Prime benefits, not just video streaming. By comparison, Netflix price start at 500 rupe per month. Prime' price is even better than Hotstar Premium, which offer a mix of Indian and Western titl for 199 rupe per month.Amazon is aggress work to compet with Flipkart for India' massiv e-commerc market. Use Prime and Prime Video as a loss leader to attract more custom to it websit over the competitor is worth it for Amazon given the massiv opportun for it to make money from it core retail business.Amazon is veri strateg about it content library. A lot of it content is local, with film and TV show produc across variou languag includ Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali. It' also partner with some of India' biggest film studio to produc show for the local audience.Netflix is go after the premium marketWhil Amazon is offer rock-bottom pricing, Netflix is maintain price around it global standard even in countri with significantli lower averag incomes. The 500-rupe plan Netflix offer in India is close to the same price as the $8-per-month plan in the U.S. Unlik Amazon, Netflix doesn't have ani other busi to subsid it video stream efforts.A such, Netflix is larg target younger, more affluent Indians. Netflix mostli offer Western program in India, which appeal to the urban-dwelling,Starbucks-drinking, iPhone-own 18- to 35-year-old in the country. It doesn't much appeal to the older, more tradit segment of the population. While Netflix ha invest in some local origin content, it' not compet with servic like Hotstar or other local services.Glob right (or even region-specif rights) to popular Western content can be expensive. As such, Netflix need to charg more than competitors. But Netflix may have room to come down on price or increas content spend in India. Hotstar manag to obtain the exclus right to HBO' origin program in the country, and it charg onli 199 rupe per month.If Netflix want to expand beyond affluent young people, a rel small segment of the market, it will need to either increas the breadth of it content with more local show and film or lower it pricing.For now, both Amazon and Netflix' strategi seem to be working. Peopl who subscrib to SVOD servic seem to choos one or the other or both while get local content for free. Still, Amazon' strategi seem to have more leg and wider appeal in the long run.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon's Clothing Success Could Doom Department Stores and Malls;3/20/2017;"The idea that brick-and-mortar store have an advantag over onlin retail when it come to apparel sale ha been a mantra that tradit chain have clung to. On a certain level, at least for older folks, it' a concept that make sense. Buy cloth from a websit likeAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) doe not allow you tri them on. That lead to the inevit hassl of returns, sometim more than one, and less-than-inst satisfaction.Th abil to tri cloth on in a store -- or make return and exchang in store on item bought from that store' websit -- seem like it would be a moat protect physic retailers. For younger buyers, however, the 18-to-34-year-old millenni group most notably, it' more of a puddl you can step around. The hassl still exists, but it' be increasingli ignored.

That would make Amazon the largest cloth retail in the Unit States,Geekwirereported.To make matter wors for Macy's, other depart stores, and the mall retail Amazon compet with, thi trend is like to acceler as millenni gain buy power.

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings;3/20/2017;"I person believ that investor should alway diversifi their portfolio with invest from differ asset classes. Iperson own17 stocks, one ETF, and four bond in my portfolio, and I rare let a singl invest account for over 10% of my total holdings.That be said, I still hold bigger posit in some stock than others, whether it be through intent accumul or previou gains. Today I'll talk about my three biggest hold --AT&T(NYSE: T) ,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , andBank of America' Seri D(NYSE: BAC-D) prefer share -- and explain my reason for own each stock.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();AT&TAT&T is current my singl largest posit and account for 6.5% of my portfolio. However, it onli becam my largest hold after the stock ralli about 25% from my origin purchas price -- which wa unexpect becaus I initi bought the stock as an incom play.AT&T ralli over the past two year for three major reasons. First, consist low interest rate kept incom investor lock into low-risk incom stock like AT&T instead of lower-yield bonds. Second, AT&T' purchas of DirecTV boost it free cash flow and usher in a new era of growth for the age telco. Lastly, AT&T'spropos acquisitionofTim Warner(NYSE: TWX) indic that it' seriou about counter OTT (over-the-top) stream competitor and cord cutter by establish a massiv media ecosystem in which it control both the content and the pipes.AT&T' posit as the nation' top pay TV provider, top fix telephon line provider, and second largest wireless carrier give it a massiv moat that' tough for rival to cross. It growth look glacial -- with analyst anticip 1% sale growth and 4% earn growth thi year -- but it attract forward yield of 4.6% make it a reliabl incom play for uncertain times.Amazon.comMi second largest posit is in Amazon.com, which account for 6.5% of my portfolio. Amazon onli rose to my top three hold over the past year due to a 35% gain. When I first start accumul Amazon share in the lower $600s, I thought that the stock' upsid potenti could be limit by it valuations. Yet Amazon' growth over the past year -- particularli in it higher-margin AW (Amazon Web Services) segment -- ha convinc me that it best day are still ahead.Amazon' AW revenu rose 55% in 2016, and account for 9% of it top line. But AWS' oper incomemor than doubledand account for 74% of the company' oper profit for the full year. That growth enabl Amazon to grow it net earn by 292% in 2016, and analyst expect it earn to rise anoth 47% thi year.Imag source: Amazon.That bottom line growth will enabl Amazon to expand it e-commerc ecosystem with new featur for Prime, new smart home gadgets, and autom logist -- all of which will like tighten it grip around it grow custom base.Bank of America (Seri D prefer stock)Mi third largest posit is in Bank of America Seri D prefer stock, which account for 6% of my portfolio. These prefer share shouldn't be confus with the common shares, which trade under the BAC ticker.In the unlik event thatBank of America(NYSE: BAC) went bankrupt, the common share could fall to zero while prefer share would be liquid at a predefin ""par value"" like a bond. The Seri D is also ""callable,"" which mean that Bank of America can redeem the share at it par valu of $25 per share at ani time.Th Seri D' par valu of $25 set a firm floor under the stock, but it also greatli underperform the common share dure bull markets. My Seri D stock stay nearli flat over the past 12 months, while the common stock ralli more than 80%. In retrospect, the common share would have been a better investment, but I initi bought the Seri D stock as an incom play, sinc it 6.2% yield easili beat the common' 1.2% yield while offer the stabil of a bond.Th key takeawaysAT&T, Amazon, and Bank of America Seri D aren't necessarili my favorit stocks, but they reflect my long-term tactic of buy both high-yield incom stock and high-growth ones. I don't plan to sell my AT&T and Amazon share anytim soon, but rise interest rate may convinc me to swap my Bank of America Seri D share for a long-term corpor bond with a compar yield in the near future.10 stock we like better than AT and TWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The sign also say, ""Relax while we load your groceries.""Th holi groceri grailAmazon ha had it eye on the groceri industri for year sinc it first launch AmazonFresh in 2007. The compani move slowly, onli oper Fresh in Seattl for sever years, but expand rapidli last year and now offer the groceri deliveri servic in more than 15 metropolitan areas.It' clear whi Amazon is angl for a piec of the groceri market. Groceri store sale total $631.3 billion last year, one of the biggest retail categori and almost as much as from gener merchandis stores, which hit $668.3 billion. Unlik chain likeWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ,Costco, and evenTarget, which all deriv a signific percentag of their sale from groceries, Amazon ha onli begun to penetr the huge market.Groceri present singular problem for an e-commerc compani like Amazon. Fresh produce, meat, dairy, and frozen food can't sit out in the hot sun like the averag Amazon deliveri can, so the compani need to coordin with custom to ensur they'r home to receiv their deliveries, or deliveri them in packag that will keep at temperature. Amazon also need special truck and facil that will also keep food fresh.Thos challeng may explain whi the compani is increasingli turn toward brick-and-mortar store to break into the deliveri market with it new Amazon Go store and the upcom pickup locations.Th Wall Street Journalalso report last fall that Amazon wa aim to open as mani as 2,000 groceri store nationwid over the next ten years. However, Amazon deni that report.L to the partyAmazon is known for innovation, and though it new pickup site may seem novel, they are not much differ from what rival like Wal-Mart andKroger(NYSE: KR) are alreadi do at hundr of stores.Wal-Mart introduc it own groceri pickup program in 2014, and ha ramp it up quickly; the world' largest retail expect to have pick-up kiosk at nearli 1,000 store by the end of thi year. Wal-Mart' dedic to expand the program is a sign of it success, as the company' scale back on open new store to make invest in program like groceri pickup. Groceri pickup ha also been a signific driver of the company' own e-commerc growth. The groceri segment make up more than half of revenu at U.S. Wal-Marts, so it' key that the compani defend it leadership from rival like Amazon.Imag source: Wal-Mart.Kroger, the nation' biggest tradit grocer, now offer it own groceri pickup service, ClickList, at more than 500 store nationwide, and is also rapidli expand it, as it management, like Wal-Mart's, ha found an overwhelmingli posit respons from consumers. Unlik Wal-Mart' service, which is free, ClickList cost $4.95 per shop trip.Th detail of Amazon' new pickup servic are unclear, as the compani ha yet to make an announc about it. We don't know, for instance, it there will be a pickup fee; if the program will be exclus for Prime member or open to all customers; or if there will be ani bonus or perk to the service.A it stand now, Amazon ha given Wal-Mart and Kroger a big head start in groceri pickup, and those two retail have a built-in advantag with thousand of store that can easili host pickup kiosks. Amazon, on the other hand, need to find and convert new real estat each time it wish to open a new pick-up station. The econom of a store that custom can't actual shop in may be question as well.Though the technolog behind Amazon Go is potenti groundbreaking, the initi report of Amazon Fresh Pickup seem like more of a me-too service. Investor won't get to make a full assess until Amazon unveil it, but for now, the advantag in groceri seem squar with Wal-Mart and Kroger.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That' up from 1.1 million in 2015.One of the biggest pain point for cabl compani is millennials. A recent survey from Videolog found just one-third of millenni male plan to pay for televis thi year. That number is shrink as 9% of millenni plan to cancel their cabl subscript thi year, accord to a survey from Magid Advisors.But millenni aren't all debt-strap cheapskat look to save a few buck everi month. Less than one-third of millenni said cost wa a reason for cancel cable. Here' the real reason more millenni are cut the cord.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti ImagesThey don't need cableTh biggest reason millenni are cancel their cabl subscript is becaus they'r get enough entertain from over-the-top stream servic likeNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime, and Hulu. Over half of respond said they were satisfi with what' avail a la carte.Al three major stream servic have been stock up on premium content over the last few years. Netflix' budget balloon to $6 billion thi year, and it slate of origin product is win Emmi and Oscars. Likewise, Amazon doubl it content spend in the second half of 2016, and it too brought home more than a few trophi thi award season.

Mani provid have introduc skinni bundl in recent years. Magid Advisor Mike Vorhau see skinni bundl as a key part of the solut to keep custom that would otherwis leave.But skinni bundl suffer a few problems. First, it' realli difficult to creat a compel bundl of a few channel sinc a hand of media compani control the hundred-or-so cabl networks. If a cabl provid want one channel, they have to take a whole group of channel from the media company. Moreover, skinni bundl simpli focu on price, not the major conveni of over-the-top services.On big advantag of servic like Netflix is subscrib can watch what they want where they want on ani devic they want.

3 of the Most Undervalued Tech Stocks Today;3/18/2017;"With index bump along at record highs, it can be hard to find stock bargain these days. The challeng is tougher still in the tech sector, which isn't known for serv up scream buy opportun to investors.But our Motley Fool contributor have identifi a few promis prospect that may be fli under Wall Street' radar right now. Read on to find out whi the market is grossli underestimatingAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,CenturyLink(NYSE: CTL) , andAppli Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Y heard me right -- Amazon is a bargainAnd Bylund(Amazon.com):Yes, I know. Amazon share trade at 170 time trail earn and would not be consid a valu play by most investors. Even the forward P/E ratio seem steep at nearli 67.But those tradit at-a-gl valuat measur do a terribl job of weigh Amazon' actual value. The stock is actual terribl undervalu today, leav lot of room to build a posit befor the market realli catch on.You see, Amazon happen to be an extrem effici cash machin under the cover of an equal effect tax-reduct strategy. The compani record $16.4 billion in oper cash flow in 2016, yield $9.7 billion of free cash flow after subtract Amazon' capit expens and leas prepayments. Thank to larg chunk of non-cash oper costs, mostli report as depreci expens and stock-bas compensation, Uncl Sam onli saw $4.2 billion of oper profits. So the tax bill came in at a measli $1.4 billion, leav $2.4 billion of bottom-lin GAAP earn -- which is the start point for those noseble P/E ratios.So Amazon' tax rate work out to 33% of it oper incom -- but onli 8.5% of oper cash flows. Likewise, the stock may be trade at 170 time trail earn but onli 42 time free cash flows. And if you still think that sound expensive, have a gander at Amazon' cash flow growth:AMZN Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.In that light, Amazon' stock isn't expens at all. The global e-commerc platform provid a stabl financi base, from which the Amazon Web Servic divis is take a fli leap. That technolog servic saw annual sale rise 55% higher in 2016, while oper profit more than doubled. AW now stand for just 9% of Amazon' total sale -- but 74% of it GAAP oper profit or 51% of the adjust oper line.Yes, Amazon is a legitim tech stock. No, it isn't ridicul expensive. It is, in fact, a fantast deal right now. Someday, market price will catch up with Amazon' true cash-mak prowess, and you don't want to miss out on that hockey-stick moment.A merger of equal that will pay offStev Symington(CenturyLink):It' hard to blame CenturyLink investor for bid share of the telecommun leader down nearli 30% over the past year. After all, it legaci voic and low-bandwidth data servic busi have continu to decline, more than offset growth from it newer strateg revenu streams. And there' plenti of uncertainti surround CenturyLink' impend acquisit ofLevel 3 Communications(NYSE: LVLT) , which, given the deal' $34 billion enterpris value, is more a merger of equal than anyth else.But I'v alreadi argu that thi merger could be a fantasticdriv of sharehold value. For one, Level 3' nearli $10 billion in aggreg net oper loss should significantli improv the combin company' free cash flow, which will offer financi flexibl and help CenturyLink fulfil it expect of maintain it seemingli lofti dividend (which yield an uncomfort 9.3% as of thi writing). And by combin their respect massiv fiber networks, CenturyLink and Level 3 will enjoy obviou benefit of scale, as well as signific cost synergi by focus capit invest on increas capac and extend that network' reach. CenturyLink also expect to gener $975 million in annual run-rat cash synergi through oper effici and similar measur after the deal close in the third quarter of thi year.Al the while, CenturyLink continu to posit itself to drive increment revenu as a lead IT servic and cloud solut provider. Most recently, we saw thi effort progress with the launch of it new Cloud Applic Manag aim atwoo enterpris clientswho want to simplifi deploy of workloads, manag services, and third-parti cloud resourc across hybrid host environments.A it stands, with share trade around 11 time thi year' expect earnings, I think long-term investor will to endur CenturyLink' period of transit could be handsom reward for their patience.Put your chip downDemitri Kalogeropoulos(Appli Materials):Appli Materi stock ha ralli late as a surg in order for it core semiconductor system sent revenu and earn to new highs. Yet, in my view, the current valuat of less than 20 time last year' earn and 3.5 time sale doesn't fulli reflect it improv busi outlook.Th tech materi specialist gain signific market share last year even as the foundry, memory, and logic industri enjoy a major cyclic upswing. That' great news for the business, but there are even more excit gain happen beyond these area that constitut Appli Materials' tradit strength.Display technolog isjust one promis example. The divis ha grown at a 20% pace each year sinc 2012 and is set to pass $2 billion of annual revenu soon as demand for OLE manufactur capac soars.Look further out, sharehold are like to see Appli Materi benefit from major long-term invest by tech giant into applic like virtual reality, autonom vehicles, and more power consum electronics. All of these trend will requir key advanc in just the type of fundament silicon, memory, and display technolog that Appli Materials, and its$1.5 billion annual R&D budget, can provide.A it growth segment grow to take up a bigger portion of revenue, I'm expect the busi to becom both more profit and less cyclic over the next few years, which could make it an attract buy for tech investor shop for growth at a reason price.10 stock we like better than AmazonWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Target Corporation (TGT): An Attractively Valued Dividend Champion on Sale;3/18/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) oper gener merchandis store in the Unit State and Canada. Target is adividend champion, which ha paid dividend sinc 1965 and rais them everi year for 49 year in a row.makeArticleAd();Th most recent dividend increas wa in June 2016, when the Board of Director approv a 7.10% increas in the quarterli dividend to 60 cent per share.Th company' largest competitorsincludeWal-MartStor Inc(NYSE:WMT),Costco Wholesal Corporation(NASDAQ:COST) andAmazon.con, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Ov the past decadethi dividend growth stockha deliv an annual total return of 1.60% to it shareholders.Futur returnswil be depend on growth in earn and dividend yield obtain by shareholders.Mor recently, the stock price ha been hammer by a declin in earn expectations. Thi is whi I want to take anoth look at Target.Th compani ha manag to deliv a 3.60% averag increas in annual EP over the past decade. Target is expect to earn $4.01 per share in 2018 and $5.80 per share in 2019. In comparison, the compani earn $4.09 per share for fiscal year 2017.Between 2005 and 2016, the number of share outstand ha decreas from 912 million to 582.5 million. The decreas in share outstand throughconsist share buybacksadd an extra growth kick to earn per share over time. I do not like the fact that the net incom between 2007 and 2017 decreas from $2.787 billion to $2.669 billion.Target focus on affluent consum with it upscal stores. It custom base is somewhat differ than that of competitor Wal-Mart. Mani of Target' custom enjoy shop there, and are attract by the appeal of offer and overal atmospher within the stores. Target' store are gener more appeal than those of Wal-Mart, and are cleaner.In addition, Target manag to retain shopper with it RedCard. Shopper who use the Target Card get a discount, but also tend to spend more than the averag purchaser. In addition, the compani ha been abl to drive more traffic with sale of grocery/food items.7 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are Actual SafeWhat is the competit advantag of Target?I believ that the compani offer a uniqu shop experi that competitor like Wal-Mart do not offer. I also believ that Target look for a certain type of consumer, who doe not like the assort of good and the experi that Wal-Mart provides, yet still want to get a bargain. The compani ha been abl to offer fashion chic items, which draw the specif type of shopper they target.Th compani also offer conveni locat for shoppers, who come to Target for it qualiti merchandise. I believ that share could deliv a veri good return to investor who are will to weather near-term turbul at the company.Growth for Target could be driven by expans of number of store in the US, growth in same-stor sales, as well as expand onlin sales. The compani is target cost cuts, in order to boost margins. I am more interest in increas the number of stores, in order to increas penetr in the US.Rel to the number of Wal-Mart store in the US, I still believ there could be area of new store develop for Target, as long as thi is execut in a smart way of course. Unfortunately, the number of storesha gone nowher sinc 2010.Despit theissu that Target experiencedwith it Canadian expans in 2013-2015, I think that the compani may have an opportun to expand internationally. Thi is a driver which could propel earn per share forward for the next 20 years. It ha to be execut better than the Canadian store fiasco however.Anoth driver for futur growth could be the CityTarget stores, which are smaller, but provid the option to locat in dens popul areas. Those store could have better product due to higher potenti traffic and higher inventori turnov becaus of that.On risk that may or may not be overblown is the competit from the like of Amazon. When you have a competitor that sell at cost, bundl their sale servic with other complementari product for a portion of customers, and whose custom do not pay sale tax in most states, you are at a disadvantage.That be said, it is highli unlik that retail like Target will be driven away from onlin competitors. I know that it is veri fashion to forecast the demis of the tradit brick and mortar retail today. I do not subscrib to the popular opinion of the day. It is veri like that Target would keep expand it onlin presence, and offer someth to consum a servic which Amazon doe not offer today - the onlin to store shipment method. I also believ that not everyth is worth purchas online, nor are onlin sale a good venu to do conveni shopping. When a custom get to a store for one thing at a physic location, they are veri like to buy someth els on their journey throughout the store.It make sens to purchas item right away, rather than wait for day or week for them to arrive. Some item are much better to person tri and touch, rather than have someon els deliv them for you. The valu of repeat and those custom who do their weekly/monthli visit to the Target store is veri power forc for Target as well. That be said, Target is work on expand it onlin presence, which would actual be good for the busi overall. However, it may result in near term pressur on margin and profits.So just becaus Target ha a higher amount of onlin sale growth, and invest billion to accomplish that, there is no guarante that thi invest will pay off. In fact, thi invest in the onlin sale channel will depress margin and profit in the near term.Th annualdividendpay ha increas by 20.50% per year over the past decade, which is much higher than the growth in EPS. Thi wa achiev mainli becaus the compani decid to pay a higher portion of earn to sharehold in the form of dividends. Futur growth in dividend will be much lower than that however, and will be limit by the growth in earn per share in the future. Given the lack of earn growth over the past decade, and competit pressur in the retail industry, I would expect a sluggish dividend growth go forward.A 20% growth in distribut translat into thedividend payment doublingeveri three and a half year on average. If we check the dividend history, go as far back as 1986, we could see that Target ha manag to doubl dividend almost everi six year on average.10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the BillsIn the past decade, the dividend payout ratio ha increas from 13.20% in 2008 to 50.70% by 2016. The quadrupl in the dividend payout ratio explain the rapid growth in dividend per share. I believ that long-term growth in earn per share will determin futur dividend growth. A lower payout is alway a plus, sinc it leav room for consist dividend growth minim the impact of short-term fluctuat in earnings.Th return on equiti ha gener remain between 15% and 19% over the past decade, with the except of the drop in 2014 when Canadian oper were lose money. Onc Target earn rebound by 2016, thi indic went up to 24%. I gener like see a high return on equity, which is also rel stabl over time.Currently, Target is cheapat 13.70 time forward earn and yield 4.30%. I took advantag of the drop last week in order to add a littl to my posit in thi retailer. I believ that the press releas didn't seem to warrant such a larg declin in the share price. Thi wa definit driven by the anim spirit of fear, which is someth I want to take advantag of.On the other hand, it is possibl that the stock price goe down from here. Thi is whi I tri to buy a littl on the way down, in order to reduc the impact of error in case I am wrong in my assessment. As an investor, my goal is to reduc the impact of error in tri to catch a fall knife. Thi is how I manag to accumul a posit in 2014, when the compani wa rock by scandals.I grew concern that Target' net incom wa flat, which is whi I sold a larg portion of my stock in 2015 and anoth block last summer. Given the lack of earn growth, the onli reason to buy is as a play on the market overreact to bad news. Otherwise, I view Target as a long-term hold, but I would not be ad more if I were a long-term investor. Thi is becaus without growth in earn per share, we won't be abl to enjoy much in term of dividend growth and growth in intrins value.That be said, even if earn were flat for the next decade, a 4% yield and attract valuat today may gener a return that would be compar to that of the broader market dure that time frame.Ful Disclosure: Long TGT and WMTMore From InvestorPlaceTh 7 Best ETF for Retir Investors7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Flush With CashTh postTarget Corpor (TGT): An Attract Valu Dividend Champion on Saleappear first onInvestorPlace."

4 Reasons Amazon Is Winning the Smart Speaker Wars;3/17/2017;"The home smart speaker market didn't even exist just a few short year ago, but it' take the world by storm.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) introduc the categori with the debut of Echo, the hands-fre speaker, power by it cloud-bas digit assist Alexa.

While competit in the field is intensifying, it may be difficult for similar product to overcom Amazon' earli lead. Here are four reason whi Amazon could come out on top.First out of the gateHav a two-year head start is a clear advantage. Alexa' foundat in artifici intellig give it the abil to learn and improv over time, adapt to the vocabulari and speech pattern of each user. The more interact it ha with consumers, the more intuit and use it will become. Earli on, Amazon provid a skill kit to develop and encourag partner to incorpor voic commands.

As a result, you can use your smart speaker to control home autom devices, order pizza, or check your credit card account.Echo and Echo Dot. Imag source: Amazon, Inc.makeArticleAd();High cost of switchingMani consum are rule by inertia, be reluct to chang ecosystem due to the high cost of switching. Issu such as exclus content, the learn curve, and the financi cost involv may be factors. With thi in mind, Amazon is pursu a strategi that the compani with the largest instal base wins. With an estim 8.2 million devic sold and growing, be the first product consum own in the categori breed familiar and give Amazon a distinct advantage.Product search habit are evolvingChang in consum behaviorwhen search for product may also work to Amazon' advantage. Two recent studi reveal Amazon is increasingli consumers' first stop when search for a product. A PowerReviewsstudyin June 2016 reveal that 38% of US consum began their product search on Amazon, while onli 35% start with Google. A Septemb 2016studybi BloomReach report similar findings, with 55% of consum initi their search for a product with Amazon versu 28% with a search engine. While these pattern will no doubt grow Amazon' e-commerc sales, it will also increas the likelihood that a shopper' introduct to the smart speaker categori will be with Amazon.

That said, thi will be yet anoth way for Amazon to lock custom into it ecosystem and could lead to signific futur sale from the company' e-commerc website.Ther are area where Amazon is still at a disadvantage. Smartphon penetr is one example. Digit assist made their debut on smartphon and compet entrant are alreadi in the hand of hundr of million of consumers. As the competit ramp up, potenti buyer may be tempt to purchas a smart speaker in an ecosystem they alreadi own, rather than learn a new one.

4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangs;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh so-cal ""FANG stocks"" have been an incredibly-wel perform group. For those who don't know, FANG consist ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) - formerli Google.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhi ha thi group been so successful? Despit a few of them sport lofti valuations, they are the respect king of their industries. Facebook domin social media, Netflix own streaming, Amazon is the king of e-commerc and Googl own the onlin search engine.Ov the past five years, Alphabet is the worst perform of the FANG stocks, return ""just"" 180%. After that, it' Facebook, which ha gener 265%. Amazon' 360% return stand out and Netflix' 830% gain jump off the page. Have these stock gone too far, though?7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeI wouldn't necessarili argu that. Some name warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let' take a further look to see which stock are worth hold onto and which are worth take profit in.FANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)Source:Th Crunchies! via FlickrWe'l keep the FANG stock in order, so let' begin withFacebook. Facebook ha impress captiv billion of user through it platform. At last check, Facebook cater to 1.23 billion daili activ users, an 18% increas year-over-year. Monthli activ user of 1.86 billion increas 17% year-over-year.Even more impressively, Facebook ha found a way to grow it revenu growth. That may seem like a typo, but it' not. FB ha manag to not onli grow sale on a year-over-year basis, but also acceler that rate of growth as well. After impress grow sale in the 40% to 49% rang through fiscal 2015, FB ha now manag 50%+ revenu growth for five consecut quarters. Obvious the compani hasfound a way to continu growand it user are not tire of it variou ad formats.FB stock is not egregi price either; with a forward price-earn ratio of just 21, Facebook share are not that expens with earn per share expect to grow 28.1% thi year and 23.4% next year.Throw in the fact that Facebook ha top earn expect over the past 13 quarter and the stock becom even more attractive. Share have been on a tear thi year. But a pullback to it 50-day move averag near $131 could be a buy opportunity.FANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockAMZN stockha also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decay retail sector and Amazon' abil to capit on that weakness. But judg the futur of commerc can be difficult, especi with how quickli Amazon continu to move.Th biggest concern for Amazon skeptic ha been earnings. Despit year of 20%-plu revenu growth, AMZN' bottom line ha hug the flatline. Manag argu that it' invest in itself for even more growth and so far, investor have been patient. They'v also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, share are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon start to pad it bottom line with it Web Servic cloud business.Whil I person love Amazon, I would be a bit leeri of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast thing can chang with sentiment. In the begin of 2016, AMZN stock stumbl from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startl plenti of investors, despit the stock rebound to north of $800 a share within a year.Th lesson here is simple: Amazon share are not invinc dure pullbacks. Should we get a notabl broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time tobuy the stock. Now that it' through the holiday season andcontinu to invest at a heavi pace, share could struggl in the intermedi term.7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeA declin to it 200-day move averag would be a great place to initi a long position. That mark is current near $780 per share. Ani further declin could be use to accumul the stock.FANG Stocks:Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixNFLX stocki one a lot of investor are kick themselv over. Share languish below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some fear higher content cost and sloppi oversea execution.Thos fear still exist to some point, but Netflix ha shown better execut as of late. As a result, share have catapult to north of $140. The stock ha been consolid nice around thi level. With the 50-day move averag just below, it appear Netflix may be set up for amov to new all-tim highs.Investor who want to buy now could use the 50-day move averag - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possibl declin to it 200-day move average, current just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investor may consid initi a posit in the name, with a plan to purchas more on addit declines.Th problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not mani investor question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which hold a domin posit in the stream world. I consid Netflix a veri battleground-bas stock. On the one hand, it' trail P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of it five-year range. On the other hand, it forward P/E ratio is the lowest it' been in the same time frame.Th stream offer from Alphabet' YouTube, as well asHulucould also be a concern. For now, the bull seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix' execut deterior or competit eat into it growth, the narr may change. But for now, stay long Netflix seem like it will work.FANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockLik Facebook, one of the main attract toAlphabeti actual the valuation. Trade at 21.8 time next year' earnings, share of Alphabet aren't price too expensive. Analyst expect GOOGL to churn out earn growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earn growth over the next five years.Alphabet' founder may have pave the way for internet domination. But there' a new team member to it C-suit that ha given GOOGL a much-need boost. CFO Ruth Porat join the compani in May 2015.In the year lead up to her hire, share had been stagnant, return just 5%. Sinc her addition, though, the stock is up a whop 60%. Doe it also seem like a coincid that Alphabet miss analysts' estim on at least six straight quarter prior to her arrival? Sinc then, Alphabet ha top estim in five of the past six quarters.Admittedly, Alphabet' transpar ha been better, make it easier for analyst to form estimates. But thi ad clariti make it easier on investor and help lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet take some gambles. For instance, consid Alphabet' self-driv car unit, Waymo. Porat ha not stifl thi growth. Rather, she ha reign in expens and channel GOOGL' focus. As a result, the bottom line ha improved,without futur potenti be eliminated.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashWith a consist core busi in Googl and potenti upsid in busi like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With it depend growth and a reason valuation, it' even better. At just a hair under all-tim highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of it 50-day move averag near $840 and a further declin to it 200-day move averag near $800 would offer better entri opportunities.A of thi writing, Bret Kenwel did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Th post4 Famou Tech Stock That Could Lose Their Fangsappear first onInvestorPlace."

What Is Costco's Competitive Advantage?;3/17/2017;"When a consum pay $55 or $110 a year to joinCostco(NASDAQ: COST) he or she ha to actual shop there to gain valu from the membership.In most cases, onc the new member spend a year actual do that, he or she ha save enough money (or at least believ that to be the case) to make renew an easi decision. Even when a custom doe not actual take advantag of the membership, good intent to do better next year can lead to a renew as well.It' a loop that ha benefit the fit industri for as long as gym membership have existed. If a consum actual use the gym, the monthli fee is money well spent. If he or she doe not, the same underli logic that caus the person to join in the first place (weight loss, a desir to get fit, heath concerns, etc.) keep him or her from quitting.makeArticleAd();For the most part, you can't work out a gym where you are not a member and you can't save money shop at Costco if you don't join. And yes, there are guest pass for gym and backdoor way to shop at the warehous club. But in a broad sense, pay for membership strengthen the consumer' tie to the brand while the underli valu proposit either increas usag level or produc guilt about leaving. That creat a competit advantag for Costco that onli a few other retail can compet with.Peopl must join Costco to shop at it store (though there are a few exceptions). Imag source: Costco.Costco is not alon in thi modelTh warehous club' membership model work a lot likeAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime program. Consum pay the onlin retail $99 a year (or $10.99 a month) to get access to free, two-day shipping, the company' stream video service, and a host of other perks. Becaus those custom have to pay a fee up front, mani are more inclin to buy from Amazon.com than non-members.Researchfrom Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) show that the 65 million Unit State Prime member it believ Amazon had at the end of Q3 2016 spent ""on averag about $1,200 per year, compar to about $600 per year for non-memb customers."" It' hard to know if peopl join Prime becaus they alreadi use Amazon a lot or if the membership caus them to use it more, but it' almost certainli a bit of both.Get free ship make buy from Amazon feel like a better valu and the more you use it (a long as you are buy thing you would have purchas elsewhere) the more you save. The same is true of a Costco membership -- especi the $110 Execut Membership, which give custom 2% back (up to $750 a year) on elig purchas -- and the warehous club ha experienc someth similar to what CIRP learn about Costco.Execut Member repres a littl over a third of Costco' membership base but account for about two-third of it sales. That' someth CFO Richard Galanti brought up in the company'sQ2 2017 earn callwhen he also note that the compani had a 90.2% renew rate in the U.S. and Canada, which he call ""basic flat and certainli in line with normal results.""Thi keep Costco strongCostco doe offer low prices, and joining, especi pay for the Execut Membership, is a good way to save money for mani people. Onc the chain ha a customer, it' like to hold onto him or her, becaus of the promis of what it offers, and the increas futur save it represents.Th more someon shop at Costco, the more he or she will valu the membership. But even if a custom doesn't shop enough to get $55 or $110 in valu (rise to $60 and $120 in June) he or she may still renew becaus the onu for not save money fall on the individual, not the retail (just like it' not the gym' fault you did not workout).For a rival chain to break Costco' cycl it would have to offer similar price without charg a membership fee while also spend money to commun it wa do that. It' hard to imagin anyon even tri that becaus most of Costco' profit, about 75%, come from membership fees.That mean ani competitor match Costco' prices, while spend to market it brand without take in membership revenue, would be a money-los proposit until it built up a signific amount of market share. Costco like ha noth to fear in that regard and it membership model should continu drive steadi revenu and impress renew rate even as countless other retail struggle.10 stock we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Facebook Roundup: Video, Sports, Jobs, VR, Fake News, Etc.;3/17/2017;"FacebookFBshar have appreci 4.8% over the past month, easili beat the S&P 500 averag increas of 1.3% and the 2.8% appreci of the Internet Servic market, to which it belongs.Th Zack Rank #3 (Hold) stock (You can seeth complet list of today' Zack #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock here) hasn't seen estim revis dure thi time, but given it Growth Score A and promis to invest heavili in the busi thi year, that isn't realli surprising.So what' the reason for the enthusiasm about Facebook? Read on to find out.Sport Deal Are Roll InSoci network are a big boon for sport leagu and right holder becaus of dwindl viewership on tradit platform like TV, especi among younger audiences. Social network also facilit better interact with the event by combin viewership, commentari and reaction to a game, make it a more enjoy experience.They also help content provid reach their audienc directly, result in innov that can further person the experience. That' the reason they have been tri out event on both Facebook and Twitter.Ov the past month, Facebook sign on Major Leagu Basebal (MLB) for a game a week and Univis Commun for 46 Liga MX game (live game from Mexico' top soccer league). The Liga MX game are target at U.S. audienc onli with Tonia O'Connor, Univision' chief commerci offic and presid of content distribut expect it to better connect with and grow it English speak audience.Video Is the FutureFacebook ha launch a new TV app for AmazonAMZNFir TV, AppleAAPLTV and Samsung Smart TV, with possibl plan to further expand to other platform like MicrosoftMSFTXbox, SonySNEPlaySt and other stream devices. While thi will like enable/support longer video formats, Facebook ha said it intent is not to compet with Netflix but rather to enabl Facebook user to watch their prefer video on just about ani screen of their choic (and that includ TV screens).Of cours that' not the onli video announc Facebook made. The compani say that henceforth, video will play automat with the sound turn on by default (if the devic sound is turn on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watch the video while scroll through your newsfeed. Facebook say that test show posit reaction from user although it' obviou that not everyon will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedli in talk with music label to bring their content to the app, which seem like an open challeng to YouTube, Google' compet site. For labels, the new distribut channel will increas their leverag against YouTub for more favor terms. On the flip side, the chanc of piraci will increas given the natur of Facebook' free platform.Th increas scope for advertis is also an indic that the compani is gear up to grab it share of TV ad dollars.Tim for a VR Realiti CheckLast year saw a lot of hype relat to virtual realiti (VR), which wa bill as the next major platform for consumer-typ experi after the mobil revolution. SuperData Research reportedli had veri ambiti growth target of $5.1 billion in 2016 (from $600 million in 2015) to $8.9 billion by 2017 and $12.3 billion by 2018. The longer term estim are even more optimistic: Citigroup reportedli say that the AR/VR market will gener $2.16 trillion by 2035.Near term, however, thing don't look so good, with the market do just $1.8 billion in 2016. The primari drawback to adopt seem to be compel content and softwar tailor for the VR experi and still-high price for a technolog that is still in it veri earli days.Suffici softwar won't be avail until there are big enough platforms, whether base on Occulu or Google' Daydream, which is whi the two compani are push away regardless.Devic price vari huge rang from the (HTC Vive at $799, PlayStat VR at $399 and Occulus' own Rift somewher in between at $599 without the $199 for the Touch motion controllers). Other like Microsoft, Appl and even Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogl have invest in augment realiti (AR).Facebook chose the high end becaus it ha alway held that for VR to succeed, the feel must be good, not the quick-heating, nauseat experi enabl through smartphones. And becaus it want to ultim enabl social network use the technology. At ani rate, the compani ha now decid to scale back the number of Best Buy store-within-stor from 500 to 300. It' also decid to lower the price of Rift+Touch to $598. The strategi make sense: bring more peopl on the platform to financ it further development.Activist Don't Want Zuckerberg as Board ChairpersonA group of activist shareholders, part of a consum watchdog group call SumOfU have propos that an independ chairperson would better ""overse the execut of the company, improv corpor governance, and set a more accountable, pro-sharehold agenda."" It won't be easi to beat Zuckerberg sinc he hold the major vote power, but accord to Lisa Lindsley, the capit market advis for SumOfUs, the propos ""i advisori in nature… There could be a 99% vote in favor of it and the board would not be under legal oblig to implement it.

Facebook on the other hand ha peopl from everi walk of life and employ of everi kind on it network, so it' in a veri good posit to corner a much larger section of the market than LinkedIn ever reached.A Fake News Solution?Facebook ha said that it will tag news stori that an independ group of peopl say are fake with a ""disputed"" tag.

The answer is simpl -- six red flag indic that the stock could slide much lower befor it' consid a bargain.makeArticleAd();Snap' Android app. Imag source: Googl Play.1. Slow user growthTh declin ofTwitter' (NYSE:TWTR) stocktaught usthat social network live and die by their activ user growth. Without activ user growth, advertis start skip the platform in favor of faster grow ones. Snapchat' daili activ user (DAUs) rose just 3% sequenti to 158 million last quarter, compar to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17% growth in the second quarter.That slowdown wa like caus by the launch of new Snapchat-lik featur for Facebook' Instagram and Messeng app -- which includ Instagram Stories, vanish Instagram photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messeng Day app which delet photo and video after 24 hours. Instagram Stories, in particular, grew it DAU from 100 million to 150 million between last Octob and thi January.2. It cash burn rateSnap' S-1 file reveal that it finish fiscal 2016 with just $150.1 million in cash and equival -- a 77% declin from $640.8 million at the end of 2015.

That amount will help Snap tread water for a while, but it might not last long if it cash burn rate accelerates. Susquehanna analyst believ that Snap won't achiev posit free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that estim could be far too optimist if rival like Instagram Stori continu throttl Snapchat' growth.3. Widen lossesSnap' revenu surg 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on the bottom line, it net losswidenedfrom $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company' biggest expens includ multi-billion dollar cloud contract withAlphabet' Googl andAmazon.If Snap can't narrow it loss with such massiv revenu growth, thing could getveryugli onc it top line growth slow down. Snap ha also warn in it SEC file that it ""may never achiev or maintain profitability.""4. Unrealist revenu growth targetsSnap claim that it can gener $500 million to $1 billion in revenu in 2017.

If Snap' user growth peaks, it could possibl boost it number of market partner to gener higher ad revenu per customer. But more than doubl it 2016 revenu to $1 billion in 2017 seem like ahugestretch.Research firm eMarket recent trim it 2017 ad revenu forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770 million. That reduct wa modest, but it indic that analyst aren't certain that it can hit it ambiti growth targets.5. It think it' a ""camera company""Co-found and CEO Evan Spiegel ha repeatedli declar that Snap is differ from other social network becaus it' a ""camera company."" Tthat statement sound reason becaus it produc special filter and lens for smartphon cameras, but rival like Instagram can easili make similar claims.Snap' Spectacles.

However, that move could caus it to burn through it cash even faster and weigh down it bottom line with a low-margin hardwar business.Should you avoid Snap?Snap look like a compani that went public befor it form a coher roadmap toward posit cash flow and profitability. Without the abil to reach those goals, Snap remain an incred overvalu stock at nearli 60 time sales.To put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/ ratio of about 10 at the close of it first trade day.

Retailers May Be Facing an Impossible Battle Against the Internet;3/17/2017;"There' no question that the world of retail is changing, with growth in onlin shop domin byAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) at the moment. But for everyday life, the move to onlin retail feel more like a trickl than a revolution.For example, I still shop at the groceri store multipl time a week andTarget(NYSE: TGT) on a regular basis, augment with order on Amazon for random items. And for me, the shift to onlin shop ha been slowli take place over the cours of over 10 years.Everi onc in a while, you get a new perspect on retail that show who' build out the right strategi for the future, and who isn't. In my case, my wife and I are soon expect a child, and it' led to a mind-numb number of store visits, onlin searches, and call with custom servic at supplier across the country. Who knew have a babi would show everyth that' wrong with retail today?makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Th inventori problemOn of the biggest challeng retail face is inventory. The goal is to buy enough product so that shelv are stock and move quickly, but not so much that a retail ha to carri inventori for a long time, or even resort to discounting.Walmart(NYSE: WMT) ha alway been a master of inventori management, which ha been one of the key to it long-term success. But over the last seven years, the number of time it inventori ha turn over each year -- sale divid by averag inventori -- ha fallen 9%. The same percentag declin ha happen at Target, which had slower turn in the first place.TGT Inventori Turnov (TTM)data byYCharts.What can retail do to solv this? They could hold less inventory, and risk not have the item custom need when they come to the store, which could push shopper onlin where there' more inventori at their fingertips. They could also carri fewer items, but more inventori of each item. Thi may result in a higher likelihood of have the right-color item that a buyer wants, but risk not have the item at all. Again, if a retail doesn't have the item, it' like push custom online.Th supplier problemThi challeng extend to suppliers, as well, and can be easili seen in the challeng of product compani likeFitbit(NYSE: FIT) andGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) . They'v been plagu by lag sales, which lead to inventori writedowns, which lead to less invest in new product and a downward cycl for their businesses.Th challeng is that product compani have inventori at the compani level, at distributors, and at retailers, which is a supply-chain problem for everyon involved. If there' not enough inventori in the channel, you have product shortag and miss sale (see GoPro' Q4 2016). If there' too much, a compani can risk discounting, or return and writedown (see GoPro' Q4 2015). The perfect balanc is almost imposs to attain.Thi is whi I recent advoc for compani likeGoPro and Fitbit to move away from the retail model altogeth and sell online, where there' inher less inventori in the suppli chain, and therefor less inventori risk at the supplier level. But that would cut retail out of the model altogether.Th supply-chain problemFinally, the problem I highlight abov show what' wrong with the entir suppli chain and whi retail may be destin to fail. When my wife and I go shop for a car seat or stroller, we'r tri item and see how we like the look and feel. But invariably, when we make a decis on what we want to buy, it' never in stock at the retailer. I don't even know how mani time I'v heard, ""We can order that and it'll be here in a few weeks."" My other option is that I could order it on Amazon and I'll have it in two days.Thi is whi the suppli chain is a problem for retail. As sale have shrunk and inventori turn have trend lower, compani are tri to hold less inventori -- which is understandable. But as they hold less inventory, they'r less like to have what I want when I want it, mean they becom a showroom for a purchas I eventu make online.Th entir model need to be blown up and rethought by everyone, or Amazon is destin to take over the world -- which may alreadi be happening.Rethink retailI think there' still a lot of valu in the showroom for customers, especi when you'r buy an item for a baby, or furniture, or clothing. Get an idea how these item feel or look in person simpli can't be replac by an onlin shop experience.But retail should appreci that they'r now a showroom, and should use that to their advantage. I'd be will to buy a big-ticket item from a local retail and let them handl logist if I knew it would be deliv to my home in a few days. But if their sale and deliveri process is more complic than buy online, then I'll take my busi elsewhere.With inventori becom a problem for retailers, a move to a showroom model may help both retail and product companies, who could ship item direct to custom via the retailer. Of course, thi would be rethink retail as we know it.What' clear is that someth ha to chang for retailers. They'r in a death spiral of fall inventori turn lead to less inventory, and lose more sale online. Unless the whole retail industri is upended, thi could be a spiral that will be hard to escape.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We'v spent a lot of time tri to make our experi better vis-a-vi the off-pric retail becaus I think that' been the bigger competit threat for us over time.makeArticleAd();In reality, that view may just be so much whistl past the graveyard.Imag source: Getti Images.They'r not make anymor landA Macy' fortun have declined, investor are increasingli turn their attent to the retailer' asset base as a reason for believ it could still be a good investment. Much like they held onto the notion thatSear Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD) wa undervalu becaus of it vast real estat portfolio, Macy' store are seen as an opportun to exploit as it final begin to monet them.Unfortunately, as too mani found out with Sears, offload of all those store wa an ephemer benefit because, beyond the one-tim cash infus that allow the retail to keep the light on, it meant noth deeper for the business. Sale are still in free-fall, and the loss old-lin depart store chain report each quarter continu to widen.Asset sale have had a similarli neglig effect on make Macy' a better business, let alon a better investment. Fiscal fourth-quart result show sale fall 4% year over year, with comparable-stor sale slide 2.7%, lead to adjust earn of $3.11 per share, an 18% drop from last year. Macy' may be profitable, but not by nearli as much as it would appear becaus of how the cash infus have inflat results.

While there' like some truth to T.J.

Robo is the first financi compani to identifi robot as an invest asset class. They creat a uniqu classif system and a global index for investor interest in invest in robotics. I'mMotley Fool Explorerlead advisor Simon Erickson here withOdyssey 2lead advisor David Kretzmann, and we are join by Bill Studebaker, the presid and CIO of Robo Global, and Dr. Wyatt Newman, the Strateg Advisori Board of Robo Global. Gentlemen, thank for join us on the call thi evening.Bil Studebaker:Thank you, thank for the time.Erickson:Eith Bill or Wyatt, can you give us a realli quick recap so that our listen understand who Robo Global is, and what it is that' got you interest about robotics?Studebaker:Thank you, thank again for host this. Robo Global is a financi servic compani that actual wa the first entiti to defin robot and automation, and we creat the first index that track and monitor all compani on a global basis. I guess we were fortun roughli four year ago to recogn the enorm growth prospect and the rapid market developments. But at the time, there weren't ani product to track thi invest opportunity. So, we basic creat an index that' maintain by our team of financi and robot expert to insur that it remain the lead indic of robot and automation. We'v creat thi index where there is an ETF that tracks, the ticker is ROBO, that captur the overal growth trend. It' compris of 80 compani and 13 of our own proprietari sub-sectors. It' interesting, it' global, it' multi-cap, it' 20% large, 40% mid, and 40% small. Less than 2% of the compani are in ani of the tradit indic that you may be following.David Kretzmann:Awesome. Let' kick it off by talk about some of those compani and industri that you follow at Robo Global through your ETF. What are some of the industri or compani that are most embrac robotics? You might have Amazon on one end of the spectrum. I'm also curiou what you think about the other end of the spectrum. What compani or industri are more resist to chang in robot and automation? Can you walk us through some industri or compani on either end of that spectrum.Studebaker:Mayb we could pass that to Dr. Newman to start, please.Wyatt Newman:OK. I would say, first, the biggest chang that we'r see right now is in autonom vehicles. Googl is lead the way with that, but all of the automot compani are invest in it. It' interest that automot companies, traditionally, are some of the stodgiest, and for good reason. The liabil concern are huge. Make one littl chang on an ignit key and peopl die. And for them to be face self-driv car must be sheer panic. But, the pressur are so great that it' perceiv as, if you want to be a player in the future, you'd better have a self-driv car. And, so, I would say they'r embracing, but with a grimace, perhaps, the automot industry. At the other end of the spectrum, I would say the consumer, for home appliances. There are toy and novelties, but not yet what a consum would call a good invest in buy a robot. Nonetheless, I would say that ultimately, that' the market that could becom a basic industry. That' further out on the time horizon, but I think, ultimately, a bigger impact. In between there, I would say, there' the small and medium manufactur who are look for somewhat smarter robots. Previou robots, you program them to do six motion repetitively, but that is not realli an option for the small and medium manufactur who will get batch size of, say, ""Thi week we have to make 2,000 of these parts."" You'll never get your robot program in time to pay that off. But the current edg of technolog is that robot are on the verg of learn by demonstration, so that you could train the robot by exampl and then have it make those 2,000 parts. So, I think there will be an embrac of robot in that sector onc they can demonstr that capability. So, that' my rang on it.Studebaker:I just want to expand that for just a moment, if I could, please. An interest perspect that we have is that, for investor and consum to think about, is that robot is realli not a niche, but it' actual a foundat technolog that' be appli right now to, basically, all industries, all markets. It' happen now. When you think about automation, it' prolifer in and beyond just factories. Beyond factories, there' a sector trend in logistics, it' in surveillance, it' in medic services, it' in transportation. You have certain technolog that are realli allow thi to happen. You have vision technologies, which is the machin vision, the laser sensors, bar code readers, etc., they'r realli critic and in the sweet spot for automation. So, you'r realli get a big converg of a multitud of sector that are go to be increasingli have larger exposur and penetr rates.Newman:Yeah, I would add on top of that, I think the big driver, today, lead to thi Renaiss in robotics, is the brain. It' hard to tell if it' hype or if it' real. From my perspective, it' real. We'r see a dramat chang in AI capability. When you give robot better brains, what you'r do is allow your AI to have physic effect the world, whether that' transport you from A to B, or it' do custom fulfillment, or it' do farming, manufacturing, security, the brain and the machin is make the difference. That revolut is realli spur thing on.Erickson:Definit some great opportun there. One that I didn't hear you mention, and one that' familiar to the invest community, is the use of robot for exoskeleton for human for the disabled. I know that' a longer term opportunity, perhaps. But is that someth that' hit your radars?Newman:I'l comment on that. I appreci that work, and DARPA, for one, ha put a lot of money into it, particularli target wound warriors, and there ha been signific progress in that, particularli with the neural interfaces, which I think is fascin emerg technology. However, I think it is a nich market. Peopl miss limb often are not peopl who have a lot of money. The cost of the devic can be extraordinary. If you look at the [...], it pretti much broke the bank when it wa decid that Medicar or Medicaid wa go to pay for that. Sinc that time, they'v realli tighten up on the L code that will allow reimburs for a lot of these. So, historically, I think some of that ha been foiled, and an exoskeleton is go to be a lot more expens than a simpl [...]. So, I do hope that emerg as an opportun for improv of qualiti of life of affect people, but I just don't think it' go to be as big of an impact as farming.Kretzmann:When you'r look at compani in these differ industries, what is the process that a lot of these compani go through as they transit more to a futur of robot and autom and artifici intelligence. Do you see thi larg be driven by econom factors, just look at profit and loss statement, or are there other factor that go into this? Because, obviously, as you mentioned, with the vehicl industry, we'r see a complet shift of platform toward an autom vehicle. So, how doe that decis make process compar over differ industri as they transit to robotics?Studebaker:I wa just go to start by say the autom of activ can realli enabl busi to improv perform by reduc error and improv qualiti and speed, and, in some cases, achiev outcom to go beyond human capabilities. Automation, obviously, contribut dramatically, or can and should, to productivity. So, I think companies, now, are increasingli come to the conclus that they can't subsist without it. Amazon, with their purchas of Kiva Systems, effect start a robot arm race. For compani to be abl to compete, you'r not do it on cost, you'r do it on delivery. And you need the technolog like thi that autom provid to make you successful. So, I think it' increasingli becom not so much a capex decision, but realli more of an ROI calculation. With the confluenc of the technolog improv with the Moore' Law cost improv of these technolog are becom affordable. Wyatt had mention previously, allud to collabor robots, as an example. Collabor robot are a game changer, and are highli disruptive. When you think about a collabor robot that can be sold for somewher in the vicin of $40,000 that work 24-7 365 day of the year with no healthcar and no overtime, and that could be basic program through manual manipul versu physic recod of the assets, and ha the flexibl to be put in differ posit on the assembl line or whatever, thi is disruptive. Univers Robot ha a collabor robot that they maintain ha a payback insid of 195 days.Erickson:Wow.Newman:I'd like to add on that. As mentioned, the qualiti that a robot can do in specif applic ha been demonstr to exceed human capabilities, at least in niches. A lesson from the past ha been automot manufacturing, and whi it'd be automot manufactur who embrac robotics. There were two key area there. Now, that specif market is more or less saturated, but there' a histor lesson from this, spray paint and spot welding. The robot were so much better at spray paint and spot weld that you could not sell a car where those task were not perform by robots. In fact, that held up automot manufactur in China. And then as automot compani start to set up plant in China, we find that China wa the biggest import of robots. And it wasn't an issu of wage costs, it' that a human simpli could not produc the qualiti of finish that a robot could. So, that' a driver where -- and I can't speak for what happen in the corpor boardrooms, but I would say it wa recogn that if you want to be a player in thi game, you have to have robots. Now, thi will happen in other sectors, as well, in the future. I mention the automot in term of self-driv cars, and in the future, if you want to be a player in the automot sector, then you'll have to have a self-driv car. We'r see it in medicin as well. I think part of the initi sale of the Intuit Surgic robot wa larg driven by marketing. ""Come to our hospit becaus we have the latest in robot surgery."" However, there are now instanc where you can say that robot surgeri exce human-alon capabilities. That would be a ""co-bot"" example. But, there are certain operations, particularli around the pelvis, where you just can't get in there with cut open and operating. So, there' definit a reason whi you can't replac it. And then, one-third anecdotally, we work withFordin some autom and transmiss assembly, and their primari motiv wa actual healthcare. They had some oper that involv handl heavi part and lean over to assembl them, and they were get back injuri regularly. And the impact on their healthcar cost realli drove their automation. So, it wasn't as much wage as it wa some of these extern that you might not consid immediately.Erickson:Right. Follow up on that, you mention two differ type of robots. The first is more of what I would call specif tasks. You mention spray paint or spot weld for an automot company. I think of thing like the iRobot, the Roomba that would vacuum your home. On the other side, you also mention collabor robots, which think more autonomously, can do a lot more things, and are back and forth with neural networks. You mentioned, Wyatt, the brain of the oper a short while ago. Which of those two, if it wa specif task or fulli autonomous, do you think the bigger opportun for investor is in?Newman:I can't give you an either or, becaus I have some belief in each. For example, in the huge sector of e-commerc and custom fulfillment, robot that are veri good at run through a warehous and pick out product and put them in a box, a robot that satisfi that specif capabl is go to have a huge market. So, we could say, ""There' application-specific."" On the other hand, if you look at the demograph of an age population, and you can see that we'r go to need more home healthcare, and if you can do that with robots, if it' a monitor, if it' a companion, but it' also an assist that can perform chore around the house, but it would have to be a spectrum of chore befor it' afford and economical. It would have to be abl to do laundri and dish and bathroom and window and floors. It' not just a Roomba. My belief is that that will be the domin market in the future, but it' a lot harder to get there becaus your robot ha to be a jack of all trade befor it will pass that threshold of valu for the money. So, in the interim, I think it will still be the winner-ded applic that will be drive some of this. But ultimately, all of that new intellig will get merg into a multi-purpos brain that will enabl the next gener of robots.Kretzmann:We'r see robot in gener gain more and more attent from Wall Street, Main Street, and the media alike. I have a few part to thi question, I'll start with the first part. What do you guy see as the most overlook and overhyp aspect of robot today?Newman:Th overhyp ha been historical, Hollywood is alway way ahead of reality. There' still an expect that robot are capabl of much more than they are. And one of the thing that hold us back is mobility. You have to be abl to handl stairs, so, perhap human-lik robot will make a dent there. But anoth one that' realli tough to lick is emul the human hand, the flexibility, the dexterity, the strength. Still haven't met that. Power suppli are an issu for robot that have to move around. Can't just stay plug into the wall. They diminish their power pretti quickly. So, those are all challenges, and I think peopl are larg disappoint when they see that performance. One that is a mixtur of both overr and underr is the AI. About everi ten years, there' a rebirth of AI. It get overhyped, overinvested, and crash down again. We'r in anoth resurg of AI. You alway have to say, when cri wolf, is there realli a wolf there? And there realli might be a wolf there thi time. What ha been demonstr with it new techniqu and deep learn is remarkable. It is a sea chang versu anyth in the past from AI. And combin with some other element that have happen in parallel that includ cloud computing, so you have a dramat enhanc of what can be computed, network these togeth as you need them, and big data, where mani internet entiti have been acquir label data, which is the essenc of what you need to train some of these systems, you put that togeth and now you have the potenti of a cloud brain that can learn from all robot in parallel, and exploit the techniqu of learn from the new deep learning. And I think, maybe, there' realli a wolf out there thi time.Kretzmann:What would you say is the biggest misconcept about robotics, automation, AI. I know you cover some of those, but can you see something, over and over, that the media and Wall Street just doesn't seem to get? Someth that keep be repeat that just isn't quit right?Newman:Go ahead and interrupt me, I don't mean to dominate. [laughs] But part of that is, as one -- I'v been in robot research for 30-some years, so I get some of the flak from the public about robots. A current surge, which ha been support by big name is, ""Be afraid becaus the new AI and robot are go to take over."" That' one thing, I just don't see the hazard there. And secondly, ""Robot are go to take my job."" It is a double-edg sword. There will be disruption. There ha been, if you look at the promis of the new Administration, say they'r go to bring back coal job and steel jobs, 90% of those job left through automation, and there' no way they'r come back. That is just a transform of the industry. And that will continu to happen. All those Uber drivers, what are they go to do? Peopl who run around at warehous and fill boxes. There will be disrupt there. But, the other side of that coin is, where do you get wealth? If you believ that it' through productivity, then you say, where do you get productivity? And robot are right in the mainstream of that. So, ultimately, there will be more wealth becaus of this. There will also be disruption. There will be winner and losers. But I don't think we should throw our shoe into the gear and say, ""Stop technology.""Studebaker:Mayb if I could just add a few things. I think obvious Dr. Newman' technic perspect is great. From more of a qualit standpoint, I think it' fair to recogn that these activ that are most suscept to autom are physic ones, in highli structur and predict environments, as well as in other area like data collect and processing. But it' still import to think about, here, that autom as the media want to present it, is not go to happen exclus overnight. And even when the technic potenti exists, we estim that it' still go to take year for automation' effect on the current work activ to realli play out. The pace of autom and the impact on worker is go to vari across differ activities, occupations, wage, and skill levels. And the factor that determin the pace and extent of autom are go to includ ongo develop of technolog capabilities, the cost of the technology, the competit with labor, includ skill and suppli and demand and thing like that. So, it is a littl bit deeper of an effect if you think about it. And the effect of autom might be slow at the macro-level within entir sector or economies, for example. But they could be realli quit fast at the micro-level. And for individu worker whose activ are automated, or for compani whose industri are disrupt by competitor realli use the automation. So, I think that' just an interest consideration. And really, while a lot of current debat about autom is focus on the potenti for mass unemployment, peopl are go to need to continu work alongsid the machin to produc the growth. So, I think we'r ultim go to result in higher pay job for people.Erickson:Fin question for you guys, our audienc at the Motley Fool is investors, specif for the servic that we work on, growth investor who are veri interest in thi field of robot as it continu to progress. Are there a few thing that, as investor that, mayb we should be watch to see how thi field is progressing? There' a lot in media coverage, there' more news stori cover robotics. What are two or three thing that we realli should be watch to figur out how thi is come along?Newman:Th first thing that I think of is to keep an eye on the stori that continu to come out about deploy of the new AI in industri and applications. I think we'r go to see a rapid growth of success stori in that area. There may be surpris that we are not think about yet. There will be. [laughs] Of, ""Wow, AI of that sector made the difference?"" But it is a new paradigm. Even Sergey Brin said, ""I didn't see thi coming,"" and they'r in the mainstream of it. So, that, definit keep an eye on. I would say anoth one is, I just think the autonom vehicl market will be transformative, and automot compani are race to get into it. And that will chang people' lives. I think it will get more elderli peopl out, peopl who have more mobil restrictions. That will be an enhanc to qualiti of life. I think it' go to be a neg impact on peopl who are employ as drivers. You look at all the truck driver in thi country, they could be gone in a hurry. So, I would watch out for that. And, there may be fewer vehicl that are produc if you can keep your autom vehicl busi a higher percentag of the time. So, I think those will be coupl of the impact to look for. Bill?Studebaker:Yeah, I would just say that the field of robot is advanc rapidly. You have the sophist of sensors, which give the robot abil to see, hear and touch, as well as softwar that empow them ha grown exponenti in recent years. As a result, highli autonom system from hundr of compani around the globe are appear to address a broad rang of needs, rang from Google' Self Drive Car Project at home and farm robot to entir manufactur line to switch over. But I think it' import to recogn that there is tremend disruption. We'r veri earli in the game here. I'd like to say that we'r actual in the first inning of the basebal game, and the player are actual still in the locker room put on their shoes. It' hard to know who the big obviou winner and loser are go to be, and invest in a rapidli chang and turbul invest environ can be pretti complex. So, thi is whi we creat ROBO. It is an invest vehicl that doesn't have the idiosyncrat risk of ani individu company. We'r not go to get all the compani right. But investor need to realiz that thi trend is veri global. There' been 400 ventur fund in robot sinc 2012. There are 176 startup in robot next year. So, the array of technologies, capabl that are go to be come to market are go to be tremendous, and we think it' a great time for investor to focu on thi as a class.Kretzmann:Simon said it wa the last question, but I have one more to follow up on that. I think there are a coupl way to think about the opportun with robot as investors, which obviously, as we'v talk about, is an excit long-term opportunity, which is what we love at the Motley Fool. When you look at the possibilities, do you focu more on the compani that are behind the technology, whether you'r talk about robotics, the automation, the AI, or are you look more for the compani that are the earli adopt of the technologies? Or is it a combin of both?Studebaker:I would say, from our approach, it' exclus focus on those compani that are produc and sell the technologies, and not on those that are use it to enabl their business. We'r tri to find and recogn those compani with the highest threshold of revenu exposur expos to robot and automation, and not those that are obvious advanc becaus of that.Erickson:Great! Well, Bill Studebak and Dr. Wyatt Newman are both with Robo Global, the lead robot and autom index for investor interest in the robot space.

On Christma Eve of 2015, the Echo wa one of the top five item ordered, accord to Amazon' annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo devic sale climb nine time compar to 2015' holiday season.That' despit the Novemb introduct of Googl Home, a compet smart speaker from theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Dure Alphabet' fourth-quart earn call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggest Echo devices, power by the virtual assist Alexa, outsold Googl Home 10-to-1 in the quarter.But Mahaney is chang hi tune after conduct a more in-depth survey. ""Home' awar and instal base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awar in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an instal base that may be close to a third that of Alexa,"" he recent wrote in a note.makeArticleAd();It look like Googl Home is quickli catch up to Amazon' Echo.Imag source: Google.Googl plan to keep invest in Googl HomeGoogl plan to keep make Googl Home a better devic by improv it search capabl and functionality. ""We are go to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Googl CEO Sundar Pichai told investor on Alphabet' fourth-quart earn call. ""I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of thi work well for users. And thi is the core area where we'v invest in for the veri long term,"" he added.Googl intend to leverag it massiv Android platform to continu improv Googl Assistant, the artifici intellig (AI) behind Googl Home. At least 200 million devic will have access to the voic assistant, which will provid Googl with a lot more opportun to learn exactli what peopl are look for when they say, ""OK, Google.""Googl will also have to improv Googl Home' capabilities. The devic current ha around 80 Actions, which is noth compar to the 10,000-plu function avail with Alexa.

As the number of devic in use grows, Mahaney expect the amount of shop done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sale through the voic assist could reach $5 billion, accord to the analyst' estimate.Googl doesn't even have a busi model for monet Googl Home beyond hardwar sales. Search and display ad don't work veri well on a devic with no display.Moreover, Googl doesn't offer a compel differenti factor for consum to pick it devic over anoth smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there'sa rapidli grow number, have lot of reason to pick the Echo, like easi access to order thing on Amazon or inexpens use of Amazon Music Unlimited.A such, Amazon is pois to win the long-term competit even if Googl Home is catch up in the short term.10 stock we like better than AlphabetWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Unfortunately, not alldividend stocksar creat equally, and occasion some can be downright toxic for your portfolio.With thi in mind, we ask three of our Foolish contributor for one high-risk dividend stock that they would recommend you avoid. Make the list were offic superstoreStaples(NASDAQ: SPLS) , cigarett producerVector Group(NYSE: VGR) , and digit commun juggernautQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) .These dividend stock make us say, ""No thanks!"" Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Where'd the ""easy"" button go?Sean Williams(Staples):Investor have to rememb that dividend stock are about more than just their yield. One high-risk, high-yield dividend stock that investor would be best off avoid is offic suppli superstor Staples.Thi big issu for Staples, much like everi big-box retailer, is that it' face substanti competit from e-commerc (ahem,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ). Onlin competitor like Amazon have far lower overhead cost becaus they'r not oper brick-and-mortar stores, which translat into lower cost that often undercut what can be found in Staples' stores. Thi is a key reason whi Stapl ha been lose it core small busi custom to Amazon and other e-commerc retailers. Not to mention, onlin shop is more conveni on the consumer, and it can offer a greater varieti than what' found insid Staples' brick-and-mortar locations.Stapl realli onli ha two answer to thi small busi shift to e-commerce: shrink, and focu on it own direct-to-consum sales. But here' the issue: Cut cost and close store isn't a long-term strategy. Sure, it can help maintain gross margin and give off the impress of a healthi company, but sale and profit will continu to shrink. At some point it dividend will becom unsustain -- and it 5.7% yield is the onli thing realli buoy it valuat at thi point.Imag source: Staples.What' more, despit heavi invest in direct-to-consum sales, Stapl isn't see ani real payoff. Dure the third quarter, sale at Staples.com wound updecliningbi 1% on a constant currenc basis. In the recent report fourth quarter, Stapl saw it North American retail business, which doesn't includ it direct-to-consum sales, fall 5% on a comparable-stor basis.Staples' best day are like behind it, and with no clear-cut turnaround strategi and merger avenu essenti cut off by the Justic Department, it futur is veri much in doubt. Thi is a high-risk dividend stock worth avoiding.Thi dividend could go up in smokeBrian Feroldi(Vector Group):Cigarett manufactur benefit from fat margins, price power, and brand loyalti that other compani can onli dream about. That' whi mani compani in the tobacco industri can afford to send their investor big dividend check each quarter.Vector Group, a hybrid tobacco and real estat company, is no exception. Thi company' gener payout give it stock a massiv yield of 7.6%, which at first glanc look like a home run investment. However, a closer look at the company' financi give thi investor pause.Imag source: Getti Images.First off, while the Vector Group is profitable, it isn't take in enough cash to cover it dividend. Profit in 2016 total $71 million, but the annual dividend payment cost the compani $210 million. How did the compani bridg the gap? By take on debt, which isn't a sustain solution.Tak on debt to meet the dividend' demand isn't a one-tim event, either. Vector Group ha a histori of tap the debt market to fund it overli gener dividend. Predictably, thi ha caus long-term debt to balloon. At year end, Vector Group' total note payabl and long-term debt oblig stood at more than $1.1 billion. By contrast, thi figur wa $557 million at the end of 2010.I'm a big fan of compani that pay out a portion of their earn to investors, but I'm concern that Vector Group won't be abl to keep fund it dividend indefinitely. That make thi a high-yield stock that I want noth to do with.Too mani questions, not enough answersTim Brugger(Qualcomm):Th variou lawsuit and delay involv Qualcomm' acquisit ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) may not amount to much. However, despit it sound 3.6% dividend yield, the uncertainti involv the licens fee Qualcomm command -- which is handili it largest profit produc segment -- make it an iffi dividend stock right now.Imag source: Getti Images.Last quarter demonstr how critic Qualcomm' patent licens revenu is to it bottom line.

But an astound 85% of Qualcomm' licens sales, equal to $1.53 billion, count as earn befor taxes. Mobil access and relat sales?

The overnight interest rate wa rais by 25 basi points. Thi wa not a shock to most trader and investors, as a rate hike wa expect especi after solid unemploy number were releas on Friday.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrOn thing thatcanb shock that affect the market is merger and acquisitions. If you have ever been long a posit on a compani that ha been taken over, it is quit the pleasant surpris particularli for your P&L.Just on Monday, long posit holder ofMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY) were ecstat that share suddenli move higher by about 34%. Mani trader and investor will then start to think what compani may be in that same posit of be bought?Tak a look at a recent articl written byLarri Ramer. He point out thatAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) look attract for sever reasons, includ the price and their highli regard new chip and processors.With the stock trade the neighborhood of $14 a share, it not extrem expens compar to the like of anAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashThat be said, buy 100 share will set a trader or investor back about $1,400 ($14 X 100). An option trader can set-up a bullish posit for less capit for a certain amount of time with substanti less risk then just buy the outright.AMD Stock Trade IdeaTh Rationale:Th two most popular bullish posit use option are to either buy a call option or buy a vertic debit spread (bull call). Each ha pro and cons. The long call posit ha unlimit profitability, like a stock position, up until expiration, but it come with a cost of time decay.Opt are a decay asset, and everi day that pass the option lose valu due to time unlik stock.A vertic debit spread can cost less than buy a call position, can neutral time decay depend on how it is set up, but it also limit ani addit profit abov the short strike.Sinc thi trade idea is specul and base on a potenti increas in price due to either a takeov or a simpl move higher, Juli expir will be chosen, give us over 125 day until expiration. Thi may be too long or short but it doe give the stock a consider time to move higher.Th Trade:Buy the Jul $12/$16 bull call spread (buy the Jul $12 call and sell the Jul $16 call) for $1.75 or less.Th Strategy:Th maximum potenti profit for thi trade is $2.25 ($4 - $1.75) if AMD is trade at or abov $16 at Jul expiration. The maximum loss is $1.75 (or what wa paid for the spread) if AMD is trade at or below $12 at Jul expir and the posit wa not exited. Breakeven is $13.75 at expir base on a cost of $1.75.With AMD at the time of thi write trade abov the breakeven point ($13.75), the posit will not lose valu due to time decay. Thi is an advantag versu a long call position. Maximum profit is cap for thi spread no matter how much the stock may finish over $16 at $2.25. A non-spread trade like a long call would not be subject to that restriction.Th S&P 500 Bull Market Is Back! Doubl Your Dough With SPYHowever, buy the Jul $12 call on it own would cost an option trader $3.20 at the time of thi writing.

AU Optronics, Chicago Bridge & Iron, Amazon, United Parcel Service and FedEx highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;3/16/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - March 16, 2017 -Zack Equiti ResearchhighlightsAU Optronics(NYSE:AUO-Fre Report) as the Bull of the Day,Chicago Bridg & Iron(NYSE:CBI-Fre Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zack Equiti Research provid analysi onAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report),Unit Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS-Fre Report) andFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX-Fre Report).Her is a synopsi of all five stocks:Bull:AU Optronics(NYSE:AUO-Fre Report) is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and ha a clean slate of ""A"" for Value, Growth and Momentum Style Scores. That alon should make you interest in thi stock, but sinc it is now the Bull of the Day, IKNOWy are interested!AUO make LCD displays, as well as organ light emit display (AMOLED) units.Hav You Heard Of AUO?I know a lot of peopl have been look at the growth of OLED, but how mani have heard that thi sub $5 stock is play in the same space? I can tell you that Wall Street ha heard of thi compani as there are more than 15 broker cover the stock. That tell me that pro on Wall Street have heard of thi stori so now would be a great time for the amateur on Main Street to learn as well.Bad News FirstI don't have access to the report, but I see that Bernstein downgrad the stock to Underperform from market perform on March 3. Sinc that time, it ha trade as low as $3.70 and as high as $3.96. The stock close at $3.83 on March 3, 2017.On Februari 13, JP Morgan downgrad the stock to Underweight from Neutral. Thi is anoth report that I haven't seen but I am sure the analyst had a good reason for the rate change.Fin on the bad news front we have KGI secur also move the stock to Underperform from Neutral on Februari 6.Sale ReportsUnlik most domest stocks, AU Optron report monthli sale numbers. Thi keep investor a littl closer to the stori but there is still ampl room for an earn surprise. The monthli updat also tell the analyst if they should be move their numbers, so thi stock tend to have frequent earn estim updates.On March 7, the compani announc Februari sale data that show a 2.7% sequenti increas from the Januari level. On a year over year basi Januari 2017 saw an increas of 16.8% and Februari saw an increas of 41.6%.Let me write that one down again. On a year over year basis, Februari sale were an increas of 41.6%. That is huge and pretti much the tell you have been wait for.Bear:Chicago Bridg & Iron(NYSE:CBI-Fre Report) post a disappoint quarter and sinc then estim ha dropped. The stock is current a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the question becom if thi is still a ""Trump Stock"" or not.Th first thing that jump out at me on the quot overview page is that while thi is a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) it also ha an ""A"" for the valu style score and a ""B"" in growth. The 7x forward earn multipl is someth most valu investor can get their head around, so mayb thi might still be a good play after all.Most Recent ReportTh most recent quarter wa a huge miss. EP of $0.85 were 42% below the $1.48 expectation. Revenu came in lower than expect by about 7%. Normally, a big miss like thi would send the stock tumbl lower, but thi stock onli fell 3.7% in the session follow the release.DescriptionChicago Bridg & Iron Compani provid conceptu design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction, commissioning, maintenance, program management, and environment servic worldwide. The compani wa found in 1889 and is headquart in The Hague, the Netherlands.Trump Stock?Thi wa certainli a Trump Stock befor thi report. The stock wa about $28 befor the elect and the idea of a lot of infrastructur spend sent thi stock to $36. Now we have given back a lot of that move.Compani guidanc wa mostli inlin with what Wall Street wa look for, so there is no help there. One thing that doe concern me is the 7% short interest. That number look pretti low right here, but for a move like thi I would think that the short would have been all over thi stori and run that number to at least 10% or more.With the market soar higher, go short a name like thi probabl isn't your best bet. The idea here is that it is a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) becaus earn estim have move lower.Addit content:Amazon Is Enormous, and Thi Could Make It Even BiggerAmazon.com, Inc.

3 High-Growth Stocks to Buy in March;3/16/2017;"Growth stock can do wonder thing for your portfolio. The key is find great compani with solid long-term prospects, and manag team that are capabl of drive those busi forward for year and years.In our ongo search for just such qualiti growth stocks, we ask three of our contributor to pick out one they think have high growth potenti from here, and tell us why. They gave us a uniqu retail that' carv out a huge follow inDuluth Holdings(NASDAQ: DLTH) , a recov fast-casu dine darl inChipotl Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) , and a game and resort giant,Wynn Resorts(NASDAQ: WYNN) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Keep read to learn whi they think these stock are worth buy now.Buck the retail trendBrian Feroldi(Duluth Holdings):It is no secret thatAmazon.comi put the hurt on mani retailers, which is make it harder than ever to invest in the sector. Yet despit the depred of e-commerce, Duluth Hold ha been put upstellar growth numbersfor year and show no sign of slow down.How ha it accomplish this? Duluth set itself apart from other retail by offer function cloth and equip that target tradespeopl in rural areas. The compani also market it product with a sens of humor that appeal effect to it core custom base. Thi combin ha help it to develop a loyal following.It is also worth point out that Duluth isn't exclus a brick-and-mortar retailer. In fact, roughli 78% of the company' sale actual come from onlin and catalog orders. However, I'd argu that Duluth' big opportun ahead lie in expand it retail store footprint. It current oper just 16 retail store --yes,16-- but it ha identifi 100 suitabl locat for new store in the year ahead. Manag is target between eight to 10 store open next year, which is a pace that it should be abl to keep up for quit some time. When ad in the expect continu growth in the company' onlin and catalog channels, Duluth look well-posit to keep up it rapid growth for the forese future. If that play out, investor who get in today will like be well-reward for their patience.High-growth might be come back to ChipotleJasonHall(Chipotl Mexican Grill):It' been an ugli year and chang for Chipotle, after two separ foodborn ill event in 2015. First, an E. coli outbreak in it produc suppli left hundr of peopl sick from multipl restaur on the West Coast, and just when the compani had a plan in place and seem to be make some PR progress, a sick employe came to work in Boston, and end up creat anoth outbreak scare. Needless to say, thi ha caus a lot of peopl to shi away from eat at their local Chipotl in the season since. But there' some strong evid that not onli is the worst over for the burrito slinger, but custom are start to come back in a big way.When manag report fourth quarter and full 2016 result afew week back, the headlin number weren't great, but if you dig down a little, you'll see an extrem good trend unfolding. Comp -- a measur of sale at locat open more than one year -- were down nearli 5% in the fourth quarter. On the surface, that look bad, but what' miss is the context of how the food-born ill event unfold and affect comp in 2015, and how much sale start to recov in the second half of the fourth quarter.Accord to CEO Steve Ells, comp were down 20% in October, down 1.8% in November, befor turn sharpli posit in December, up 14.7%. Even better, the improv acceler in January, with comp up almost 25% accord to the company' preliminari data.Yes, it' still earli in the turnaround, and even at these higher levels, comp sale are still below 2015 level and may not fulli recov until 2018. Furthermore, Chipotl stock isn't cheap, at 49 time next year' earn estimates. But those estim are base on what could turn out to be low expect if custom continu to return at the level we have seen the past few months.A of thi writing, Chipotle' stock is still down about half from it all-tim high. Thi could be an excel time to invest in what remain a great compani with wonder long-term growth prospect while the market is still look elsewhere.Th grow game giantTravi Hoium(Wynn Resorts):There' a lot work in Wynn Resorts' favor, and the compani may be just start a long growth streak. Late last summer, it ad Wynn Palace, a $4.4 billion resort in Macau' Cotai region, to it Wynn Macau and Wynn La Vega properties, and that could be a transform move.When it oper get up to full speed, Wynn Palac alon could add $600 million to $1 billion in annual EBITDA, a proxi for cash flow from a resort. Also help Wynn is the fact thatMacau' game revenu is grow again,and VIP customers, among whom Wynn ha a strong market share, are suppli adisproportion percentag of that growth. Long term, that' a huge tailwind for Wynn, especi with Wynn Palac now open.In La Vegas, Steve Wynn is hope to start construct on Wynn Paradis Park, which would be like an adult amus park to which Wynn would charg admission. Creat the park would be signal that the compani wa doubl down on it effort to boost non-gam revenue: The entranc fee alon could add $300,000 to $400,000 per day in revenue,accord to Wynn.Finally, there' Wynn Boston Harbor, which will be the company' first foray into the East Coast game market. The project will cost some $2.4 billion and is expect to open in 2019. Given these three projects, Wynn ha a strong pipelin of growth come it way, and given Steve Wynn' histori of make profit bet on the game market, the compani is a great buy thi March.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sound The Alarm, ALRM is Headed Higher;3/15/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Get readi for some upward revis to the earn estim ofAlarm.com( ALRM). The stock is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) right now but report earn after the close on Wednesday, March 15. The compani post revenu of $69.79M compar to the consensu of $63.95M. EP of $0.19 wa $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensu estimate.In the release, the compani guid Wall Street higher. FY2017 is now expect to produc revenu of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfort higher than the $300M consensu estimate. The compani expect to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also abov the $0.65 consensu estimate.In late after hour trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estim Like Move HigherWhen a compani rais guidanc over the consensu you can expect the analyst to adjust their models. These model help them deriv their earn estim which are use in the Zack Rank. Sinc there haven't been ani earn revis over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). In the come day I anticip the stock to see sever upward revis which should help boost the Zack Rank for thi stock to a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisit and they were touch on dure the confer call. Dure the call, manag talk about how the ObjectVideo acquisit will allow custom to track car and licens plate or even custom in a store.Th Icontrol Network deal close in the quarter and the compani mention how the Piper unit power a portion of the ADT platform. The industri had been view as ""we versu ADT"" but that ha chang with the advent of custom home protect servic offer by cabl companies.An analyst question if the compani wa look to a product offer around cars, and while the compani would not commit on a specif answer, it wa clear that it could be someth come down the road. Mani time dure the call manag note that they were maintain a healthi level of spend for R&D. Have an expand platform is key becaus the secur busi ha been chang veri rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookA we think about the chang in home security, it is clear that peopl are ad devic and servic thank to the rel eas of the internet. Manag note on the call that peopl want these product and servic to come from one source.A an example, I have a Googl Cam (formerli Dropcam) and while it is access via it own app I would like to see it be usabl via my Amazon echo. Ye the Googl Nest is control via the voic recogn tool, but I would like more functionality. I often search on Amazon for devic that are compat with Alexa sinc I have power out that is control by anoth company. It too ha it own app and with onli a few devic have multipl app is alreadi a pressur point for me.With the strong revenu guidance, manag believ that it product and servic will be well receiv by customers.Analyst Note ComingA I look at where most recommend are, I see a few potenti upgrad tomorrow. Goldman Sach start coverag of the stock with a Neutral rate on Januari 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm ask about the potenti for organ growth from Icontrol which allow manag to talk about how they were go to hold their cost structur constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translat to better than 20% margin. It is possibl that Goldman Sach up the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.Raymond Jame downgrad the stock back on August 16 as the move their rate to Market Perform from Outperform. Imperi Capit ha the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.Roth Capit start coverag on Octob 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target. Don't be surpris to see that price target move to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initi with a buy rate and $37 price target on Decemb 1. They are clearli the most bullish on the stock and for good reason. I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recent post results.Trad Range?Th stock ha a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surpris to see a new level reach tomorrow. Whi do I say this? Well back on Octob 31, 2016 some unusu call buy wa spot in ALRM. The call wa a $35 strike with a March expiration. At the time, the stock wa $29 and chang so it wa a pretti big reach. I see those same call close at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anyth to get too excit about.What did catch my eye on the option chain wa all the put that move the day of earnings. The 27.5 strike that expir on Friday saw 729 contract vs open interest of 898. Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium seller as the put wa pay $0.42.I like the chanc of sever price target increas come tomorrow. There is an outsid chanc we get an upgrad on the stock as well. Throw in the idea that some mildli aggress call were bought sever month ago I and I like the chanc of thi stock trade over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter. Either way, look for thi stock to becom a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusAlarm.com Holdings, Inc.

Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Become an Airline?;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI rememb the late 1990's, whenAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) becam a momentum stock and it ha never look back. Back when you could onli get real-tim quot on the phone, and I wa astonish as AMZN stock went up $40 in a day, and kept going.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBetween June of 1998 and Septemb of 1999, at the height of the Dot-com bubble, Amazon stock split three time (12-1 in total). I refus to believ an onlin book seller could be worth what peopl were pay for AMZN stock.Her we are almost twenti year later, and Amazon stock is not onli the king of retail, but it ha expand into multipl arenas, and becom a $405 billion company. In all that time, it' hard to believe, but AMZN stock ha onli gener about $5 billion innetprofit.That' right. Amazon stock isn't just trade at 81x profit. It' trade at 81x total histor profit. It' time to admit that, yes, thi time it is different, at least in regard to valu AMZN stock. The market seem to have it own logic on thi one.Amazon Stock Is Hard to Pin DownWhat I suspect is happen is that investor know that if Jeff Bezo care about the stock and want to report regular grow profits, he could. Instead, he is the ultim disruptor, and so he ha disrupt how the market even think about Amazon stock.Th 7 Best IPO to Buy for the Rest of 2017Amazon is an ""anything"" company. It can and will do anyth Bezo wants. Believ it or not, I think that down the road, Amazon is also go to becom an airline. But not just ani airline.Let' take a step back.W alreadi know that Amazon ha contract with two airlines. As Iwrotelast September, AMZN ""announc a partnership withAtla Air Worldwid Holdings, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAWW), in which AAWW will both acquir and oper twentyBo Co(NYSE:BA) 767' to deliv Amazon merchandise. Thi wasth second deal AMZN madein thi arena, just like it had done withAir Transport Servic Group Inc.(NASDAQ:ATSG) in March"".Mi theori wa that Bezo took warrant in these compani with the intent to buy them in the future. Indeed, AMZN own warrant to buy 30% of AAWW at $37.50 per share, and the stock is now in the mid-$50's. It own warrant to buy 20% of ATSG at $9.73 and the stock is at about $17.Amazon will buy out both compani in full, I believe, to have total control over deliveri and not have to pay and reli onFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX) andUnit Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS).Amazon will merg these two compani under it umbrella and Amazon Air Cargo will be created, and possibl even spun off. It might even undercut FDX and UP to rent deliveri space on it plane for other businesses, just like it did with the larg brick-and-mortar bookstores.Bottom Line on AMZN StockI'l take it one step further. Imagin Amazon.com need to deliv good across a few hundr mile somewhere. There' some kind of cost ineffici in fli short haul, so Amazon open up a passenger/cargo airline. In the old days, you could get a courier fare if you were will to just get a seat with no baggag and your luggag space wa taken up by a compani that need to deliv someth on a commerci flight.Whi Dollar Gener Corp. (DG) Stock Is Onli Good When Thing Are BadSam thing: AMZN run a discounted, short-haul airlin for peopl with hand baggag only. Amazon get it good where they need to go, and passeng get cheap fares.Yes, it' a long way off. There will have to be complex issu dealt with, such as get gate at variou airports. Yet, likeSouthwest Airlin Co(NYSE:LUV), we'v learn that these secondari airport can be a use tool.Pi in the sky? Maybe. Yet that is how the market valu AMZN stock - for it disrupt potenti across all sectors.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter. As of thi writing, he own ATSG and AAWW. He ha 22 years' experi in the stock market, and ha written more than 1,600 articl on investing.

Expect consum to place a greater relianc on mobil for buy and to see a grow demand for mobil app and new buy technolog as we move into the later part of 2017.

On the other hand, if the Brexit effect doe not kick in, then the onlin retail market is onli go to get stronger.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Carries Some Risks;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI recent wrote anarticlesuggest thatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) wa the perfect valu play, as it wa a growth stock that wa not unreason valu base on variou criteria. Now I'll dive into what I think the risk of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMi biggest concern with GOOGL stock ha alway been that it is effect a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digit advertis billboard in the world, with about 88% of it revenu come from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock' growth ha been driven by thi spectacular seizur of internet territori from competitors.In fact, dure the financi crisis, ad revenu still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despit a worldwid ad revenuedeclineof 11% that year.GOOGL Stock and Digit AdvertisingNow, digit advertis wa still in it hyper-growth phase back then. Should anoth major crisi hit, I'm not so sure that Alphabet won't see a decline. Yet what' so astonish about GOOGL stock is just how much money it make from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% declin in total revenues, which would bring it roughli in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still gener net incom of $15 billion or so, and oper cash flow of $26 billion or so.Thi is hardli a catastrophe, which show that for now at least, GOOGL ha a lock on substanti growth in ad revenue. However, that advertis is the result of peopl use Google' search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Googl ha more than 80% search engin marketshare. It' so popular that we now use the product' name as a verb.7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackI think it will be veri difficult to supplant Googl as far as search engin usag goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less relianc on the search engin and, therefore, fewer eyebal for ads. Mobil app have obvious explod in number and usage. The more adept and fulli function that app become, the less Googl may be used.Soci media is onli go to grow, and the more that these product offer in term of either their own search engines, or place for advertis to divid their ad spend, the wors it is for GOOGL.There' also some interest competit in the form of product searches, and of course, that competit come fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Accord to a 2016 PowerReviewssurvey, 38% of user use Amazon as a place to search for products, and Googl come in second at 35%. I think about my own usag when it come to product searched, and yes, I alway start with Amazon. Inventory, price and review are the reason whi peopl start there. The larger that Amazon grows, the stickier it will becom as far as product searches, and that could mean fewer eyebal for GOOGL.Obviously, Alphabet Inc. ha plenti of money and can ramp up competit in mobil access, butAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) obvious have a corner on that market so far.What Nvidia Need to Avoid a Breakdown (NVDA)Ther is some regulatori risk, as well. The EU slam Alphabet Inc. for tweak search result to direct peopl to it own shop sites. The FCC is an unknown beast - it could end up regul the internet in way harm to GOOGL stock.However, when it come to buy the stock, I don't see immedi danger to GOOGL that make it valuat less attractive. At 18x next year' earnings, and five-year annual analyst project of 19.3% growth, it' alreadi undervalued. When I give it a 10% premium for global brand name, cash flow and cash on hand, it becom a true growth and valu play.

Is It Too Late to Get in on This Millionaire-Maker Stock?;3/13/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) went public in 1997 at $18 per share. A $2,000 invest would have been enough to buy 111 shares, and those share would have split to 1,332 share today -- which would be worth over $1.13 million.That explos growth made Amazon one of the greatest multi-bagg growth stori of the past two decades. Yet Amazon continu to grow, soar 50% over the past 12 month and lift it market cap past $400 billion.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();But after those big gains, investor might be wonder if it' too late to buy share of thi millionaire-mak stock. I believ it isn't, for six simpl reasons.1. It valuat are still reasonableA common bearish argument against Amazon is that the stock look too ""expensive"" at 174 time earnings. However, that view ignor Amazon' impress earn growth rate. Amazon grew it earn per share by 292% in 2016, compar to 140% growth in 2015 and a net loss in 2014.Analyst expect Amazon' earn to rise 49% thi year and 75% next year. Base on those estimates, Amazon trade at just 67 time forward earn -- which is reason rel to it growth rates.2. AW is just get startedAmazon' key profit driver over the past few quarter ha been AW (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. That platform lend out storag space, comput power, and softwar develop platform to massiv custom likeNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , NASA, and the CDC.Last quarter, AW revenu rose 47% annual and account for 8% of Amazon' top line. However, AWS' oper incom rose 60% and brought in 52% of the company' oper profit thank to it higher margins. That profit growth give Amazon more freedom to expand it lower-margin marketplac businesses.3. The Prime ecosystem is still expandingA key part of that marketplac push is Prime, Amazon' prisoner-tak membership ecosystem which offer discounts, free shipping, e-books, stream video, cloud storage, and other perks. The expans of that ecosystem put a lot of pressur on brick-and-mortar rival likeWal-Martand stream video player like Netflix.Last October, eMarket estim that Amazon Video wa ad user at a faster rate than both YouTub and Netflix. And last June, research firm CIRP estim that Amazon' Prime custom base in the U.S. grew 19 million year-over-year to 63 million -- indic that Prime shopper outnumb non-Prim shoppers. The studi also found that Prime member spent about $1,200 annual on the site, compar to just $500 for non-members.4. It home autom ecosystem will growAmazon is also expand it Prime ecosystem into home with cheap connect consum electron devic like the Kindl tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, Echo famili of smart speakers, Dash buttons, and DRS-enabl appliances.Imag source: Amazon.Amazon ha also taken step to connect it Alexa voic assist to other function in smart home and connect cars. Smart light bulbs, fan , thermostats, and lock alreadi sync to Alexa and Echo. Amazon ha also work withFordto sync newer vehicl to Alexa so user can control smart home devic from their car or access their vehicl from insid the home. All these servic help Amazon gather more data about it users' habit and reduc the friction in onlin purchas -- which gradual increas custom depend on it services.5. Intern growth opportunitiesAmazon' intern marketplac busi gener just a third of it revenu last quarter. That' whi the compani is expand into new oversea market like India, where it invest billion to challeng market leader Flipkart; and China, where it remain far behind market leader Tmall andJD.com(NASDAQ: JD) .Like Netflix, Amazon is launch local origin content for Amazon Video in oversea markets. These new stream shows, likeKamen Rider Amazonsand anUltraman Orbspinoff in Japan, help the compani local it brand and expand it Prime ecosystem.6. Logist cost will declineLastly, Amazon' close watch logist expens will eventu fall with increas automation. We'v alreadi seen Amazon make progress here with thousand of warehous robot and it own fleet of cargo planes, and it upcom Prime Air drone deliveri could greatli reduc deliveri cost further.Som skeptic might believ that widespread drone deliveri might not be feasible, but JD.com alreadi launch ""thousands"" of deliveri drone across rural China last November. The compani state that the test run, which wa conduct dure the massiv Singl Day rush, went ""smoothly.""Th key takeawayIt' highli unlik that Amazon can ever repeat it near 55,000% post-IPO rally. However, that doesn't mean that it' too late to get in on thi millionaire-mak stock. I person bought my share when Amazon wa in the low $600s, when mani analyst call the stock expensive. The skeptic are still say the same thing about the stock now, in the mid $800s, but I believ that it still ha plenti of room to run.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Really Comparable to Amazon?;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you'r even remot pay attent to Wall Street, you'v heard of China' e-commerc giantAlibaba Group Hold Limited(NYSE:BABA). BABA stock ha garner quit a bit of media attent sinc make it way onto the scene in 2014 and now analyst have start tocompar the firmto it American counterpartAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAni stock that ha been deem ""the next Amazon"" deserv a second look, especi consid that AMZN ha deliv return of more than 2,000% to investor that bought into the stock 10 year ago.However, while AMZN and Alibaba are both e-commerc giants, it' import to consid whether the similar end there.BABA' Intern GrowthPerhap the biggest determin of whether BABA stock can live up to it comparison with AMZN is whether Alibaba will be abl to move beyond China. At the moment the Chines e-commerc market is BABA' bread and butter and the firm ha done veri littl to break out of that bubble.Th problem with be reliant sole on Chines custom is that Alibaba is limit in term of futur growth potenti and the firm would also suffer alongsid a slide in the Chines economy.7 Cheap Dividend Stock to Buy NowThat' not to say that BABA hasn't alreadi taken step to expand it busi intern - the firm' affili Ant Financialrec boughtMoneygram Intern Inc(NASDAQ:MGI), which could eventu develop into Alibaba' own worldwid payment business.However, the Ant and Moneygram tie-up are still a big what-if for BABA stock. Right now, Alibaba ha veri littl intern exposure, without which the firm will never live up to AMZN.Alibaba Stock and Cloud ComputingMuch like it American counterpart, BABA isbuild out a cloud comput businessthat is worth considering. Alibaba' cloud comput arm is in the veri earli stages, gener just $765 million in sales. BABA' cloud effort have eaten into the firm' profitability, with the busi lose more than $90 million last year. However, all of these figur aren't necessarili a bad thing.Alibaba was, by all accounts, a late entrant into the cloud comput space. That mean that the compani is have to spend significantli in order to gain market share. That explain the lack of profit and should provid investor with some comfort about the business' inabl to turn a profit. BABA' cloud comput busi ha also put up some pretti impress growth metric over the last few quarter as well - the firm gain 114,000 new custom and saw revenu growth of 115% in the Decemb quarter.Th pictur that Alibaba' financi paint of it cloud comput busi look veri similar to Amazon Web Servic five year ago, when it had just begun. It' import to consid the fact that BABA is start it cloud busi much later than Amazon did, but as the industri is still rel new, that factor shouldn't hold BABA back.Ther are definit a lot of similar between BABA and Amazon, especi if you believ in Alibaba' effort to expand intern and the firm' blossom cloud comput arm. However, while they both overse a massiv e-commerc business, AMZN offer an impress distribut and logist network that BABA can't hold a candl to.Also,Amazon' busi model differ significantli from that of Alibaba. Amazon' busi is a mix of direct sale and commiss for it retail partners' sales. Alibaba, on the other hand, act as a middleman for both small and larg retailers.Whi Lowe' Companies, Inc. (LOW) Stock Is Make a ComebackTh firm doesn't charg a commission, but instead seller can pay to improv their rank on BABA' search engine, so you could make the argument that Alibaba' busi model is more similar to that ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.Alibaba Stock: A Differ Kind of RiskIt' also import to note that even if the two were ident businesses, the fact that BABA is base in China and conduct most of it busi there is a signific difference. As fellow InvestorPlac contributorJosh Enomoto noted- cultur differ should be consid when you'r compar the two.Gambl is much more wide accept in Asian cultures, which could be part of the reason that the firm' share price ha had such a roller-coast ride sinc it IPO. Investor who are pick BABA as the next Amazon should be awar that even if the stock doe deliv the same explos growth that AMZN has, they may not see the same financi result as BABA stock ha the potenti to trade much more erratically.Alibaba stock doe bear a strike resembl to Amazon, especi in AMZN' earli days. However, it' not worth buy BABA stock for that reason alone, becaus it is like to behav much differ than AMZN did. With that be said, Alibaba stock isn't a bad growth play when you consid it potenti expans in the payment and cloud comput space.A of thi writing, Laura Hoy wa long AMZN.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackTh postI Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Realli Compar to Amazon?appear first onInvestorPlace."

To Challenge Amazon, Wal-Mart Should Follow Lyft's Example;3/13/2017;"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) is an unfamiliar posit these days.Th world' largest retailer, which put hundr of mom-and-pop store out of busi with it superstor that offer rock-bottom prices, is now in a fight for it own relevance, play catch-up toAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Aft year of ignor the opportun in e-commerce, Wal-Mart find itself play second fiddl to Amazon, which now ha a market cap nearli twice that of Wal-Mart's. In the last year, Walli World ha taken step to acceler it e-commerc busi by buy Jet.com along with two smaller busi and rapidli expand it onlin groceri pickup program.In mani ways, Wal-Mart' struggl to overcom Amazon' advantag is similar to a battl between the leader and challeng in anoth industri -- Uber and Lyft.Th rat race in ridehailingUb wa the first mover in the app-bas ridehail industry, and is by far the leader in an increasingli fragment space. It' valu at a whop $68 billion, more than carmak such asGener Motors,Ford, andTesla Motors, show that investor have place a premium on transport rather than the car itself. Today, Uber is activ in 81 countri and 581 citi around the world, includ 209 in the US.Ridehail seem like the type of industri that would lend itself to monopoly. Onc a compani like Uber build up an armi of driver and get thousand of passeng to download it app, it would seem to have the network effect and barrier to entri to block competition.But smaller ridehail app have crept into the mix. Lyft, the #2 ride-hail company, ha becom Uber' princip challeng larg by posit itself as it cultur antithesis. Uber' brand is gener seen as bloodless and corporate, it logo drape in black. Lyft ha posit itself as the friendli ridehail service, use hot pink as it princip color. For a while, Lyft driver signifi themselv by have hot pink mustach over their cars' grills. Lyft, unlik Uber, allow passeng to tip, and encourag driver to be friendli and make convers with their fares. It also seem to treat it driver better, and ha not been subject to the protest and disput that have becom commonplac with Uber.Lyft aim for an overal differ experi than Uber. That may have seem like a minor detail, but in recent week a seri of unforc error have dramat damag Uber' alreadi question reputation. First, a tweet accus Uber of tri to break a temporari strike by New York cabbi at JFK airport went viral, prompt the hashtag #DeleteUb to start trend as thousand of user delet their account and sent angri letter to the company. Later, a blog post vilifi Uber for allow rampant sexual harass and a cultur that demean women, and a video of CEO Travi Kalanick excori a driver wa pick up by sever media sources. Report also emerg about softwar Uber creat to undermin local regulations, and Kalanick is now reportedli seek leadership counsel and search for a COO. The narr of Uber is a bad corpor citizen is now well establish and ha becom a storylin in the media that will pop up everi time there is a similar incident.Lyft wise took advantag of Uber' mistakes. Dure the chaotic weekend of airport protests, Lyft respond to the Uber boycott by pledg to donat $1 million to the ACLU. In the wake of the Uber backlash, Lyft download surg into the top ten in the App Store with nearli 200,000 in one day -- a new compani record. It wa the first time Lyft' download top Uber's, noth short of a coup for a compani valu at $5.5 billion, just a fraction of Uber' worth. As Uber retrench and lick it wounds, Lyft is now reportedli seek anoth $500 million in funding.What Wal-Mart can learnWal-Mart, with much greater profit than Amazon and a wealth of resources, is in a stronger posit than Lyft, but the stori abov highlight one key way Wal-Mart can challeng Amazon as it attempt to build out it marketplace.Amazon isn't exactli vulner in the way that Uber is. The compani ha a stellar reput with customers, but there are some who view it as overli cutthroat, and it ha been known to step on it merchants' toes. Amazon' merchant have complain in the past about the compani take their best-sel products, and sell them itself, directli compet with the merchant and often undercut them on price.For that reason, mani merchant prefer sell oneBay, say Kevin North, CEO of Terapeak, an e-commerc analyt firm. eBay act onli as a marketplac and doe not sell good directly. Those merchant view Amazon ""very, veri cautiously,"" he said. He see an opportun for Wal-Mart, say it could win over merchant by be friendlier than Amazon and not compet with them. North ad that merchant are still work for clariti from Wal-Mart on what kind of partner it would be.Wal-Mart ha sped up it effort to recruit vendors, but it' still go too slow. At the time of the acquisit of Jet.com, Wal-Mart had just 600 sellers, compar to Jet' 2,400 after just a year in business. Wal-Mart had been struggl with onboard vendor previously, but acquir Jet chang that.North call the Jet acquisit a ""game-changer"" for Wal-Mart in part becaus it bring on e-commerc mastermind Marc Lore, who found Jet as well as Quidsi, which he sold to Amazon -- but also becaus it will help Wal-Mart ramp up it marketplace.Th compani ha alreadi up the stake by offer free two-day deliveri on order of $35 or more. Now it need to aggress pursu vendors, and elimin the popular notion that Amazon is the onli game in town when it come to onlin shopping. Like Uber drivers, Amazon merchant are wari of the company' monopolist ambitions, and are eager to spread their ware over multipl sites.

However, the compani seem to be pull the right string to boost it viewership.Step up the content gameIndian consum don't mind pay a premium for exclus content, but Netflix blunder on thi front by origin launch just 7% of it library. No one' go to pay a premium for watch limit content, and the onlin stream purveyor is now go to mend this.Todd Yellin, Netflix' VP of product innovation, say the compani is go to sourc content from local provid to shore up it region content library. Additionally, it will also partner with local product hous to creat origin shows.Netflix is do a smart thing by make region shows, sinc 75% of new internet user in India prefer consum their content in local languages.

And then the smartphon encourag us to take that digit world everywher we go, leav noth but a few tap on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and constant immersion.Now, a fourth technolog -- voic computing--i remov that last barrier.Reimagin the role comput playImagin drive down the highway, come home from work, and without take your hand off the wheel or hit ani buttons, ask your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the oven for dinner, and play your favorit album, all in the same breath.

That' probabl where speech recognit is today.""Th second hurdl is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remain a strong chanc it will bemisinterpretedwhil undergo natur languag understanding, a process in which the assist attempt to comprehend what we want use the sequenc of word (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctli understood, an assist may still simpli be unabl to solv for the request due to technic constraints. Exampl of both case can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sens of how frustrat the encount can be.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneEncount like these make us feel as though we'r wast our time trust our phone to do what we could have done ourselv with onli a littl more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventu discourag us from even tryingto use our assist for anyth complex, instead reli on them onli for the most trivial of tasks, like set alarm or creat reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdl are solvabl with data, third-parti partnerships, and time, each of which the major player in thi space have been activ accru for years. Return to our example, sinc Siri wa introduc to the world in 2011, virtual assist have grown far more capabl of correctli interpret request thank to advanc in deep learning, a thrive field of AI be util byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and other to improv speech recognition, natur languag understanding, and other compon of voic comput at astound rates. (Click herefor an outstand stori byTh New York Timeson Google' signific role in make thi happen).Equ as important, decis by Appl and it competitor to open their platform up to third-parti servic have made today' voice-bas assist feel far more capabl than in year past. These decis allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride use your Uber account, or order a pizza through your storedDomino'sinform -- not unlik anactualsecretari would do.A the potenti behind voic comput becom increasingli obviou in the come month and years, we should expect more and more third parti to hop on board, eventu expand the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of order an Uber, imagin order a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-parti command avail on Amazon' voice-bas assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technic achiev and partnership will continu compounding, eventu make for a highli practic voic comput experience. Even margin improv in the technolog will convinc user to begin use voic as an interfac more frequently. In the same talk regard the current state of the voic industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as speech recognit accuraci goe from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from bare use it today, to use it all the time."" He added, ""Most peopl underestim the differ between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer.""Although we'r not yet abl to predict when the technolog will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is ani indic -- sinc Ng' speech, Baidu ha built a program capabl of dictat English three time faster, and with 20% less errors, than human be -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguabl far more import hurdl stand in the way. It' a problem share by everi other major comput medium in use today, onli voic is actual solv for it.An instantan comput experienceNo matter the medium, we'v alway interact with comput by issu commands. In the 1950s, we meticul punch those command into card befor feed them into hulk machines. Now, technolog allow us to simpli type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despit these advancements, today' medium still subject user to a uniqu set of delays, a sort of friction that inher slow down the process betweenthinkinga command and actual be abl tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decad ago, that friction most like entail track down a PC with internet, use the mous to open a browser, use the keyboard to run a search, and then sort for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simpli mean reach into our pocket for our phone, scroll with our thumb, and tap away.It' a process so effortless, the averag American now check their phone an estim 46 time per day. It' even becom fashion to argu there' no longerenoughfrict separ societi from our devices; that we'retooplug in to the digit world.So when you consid that voic computing' primari advantag iseliminatingfriction, it becom tempt to dismiss the technolog as a solut to a trivial problem. What that argument critic fail to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simpl convenience, and that ani amount of friction, no matter how small, fundament limit the dynam between a user and their comput medium in two ways.Let' take the smartphon for example.Imag Source: PixabayTh seemingli trivial motion we make when reach for our phone still requir us to be in immedi proxim of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to rememb it' on the counter even befor we can do that. Then, onc we'v reach our phone, we'r requir to physic handl it, a process that gener requir we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limit forc our comput experi to revolv around the locat of our device, as oppos to it revolv around us.They can creat roadblock for those with disabl affect their vision or hand (or really, even those who just have sticki hands, wet hands, or their hand full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immedi comput need.There' a reason speech is our most instinctu form of communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouth and ask. We do that becaus it' instantaneous. Now contrast that with have to locat your phone, have to type in your password, have to navig to an app, have to tap, type, or speak your command. These behavior are not instinctual,but we put up with them becaus the peopl around us usual don't have the answers, and becaus smartphon are our best alternative.But they don't have to be.Th rise of voiceIt' not obviou quit yet, but today' physic bound medium have left a larg hole to fill and voic comput is start to fill it.Ov the past two years, the technolog ha begun manifest itself in the form of always-on, always-listen devic abl to virtual bypass the friction inher in today' major comput mediums. Currently, these devic are best exemplifi by Amazon' line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voic recognit technolog allow user to command Alexa from across multipl room and through variou background nois at ani time simpli by call for it out loud.Imag Source: Amazon.com.Put anoth way, for as littl as $50, Amazon' Echo is give consum their first glimps at a frictionless comput experience. Follow it initi setup, there' no press buttons, no look around for the device, and no navig through screen to issu a command. When it work correctli (like Siri, Alexa is still veri much in it infanc and subject to misinterpret commands) it realli doe allow user to convert their thought to a command in the time it take to form a sentence, captur the essenti promis of voic as a medium.And if the earli estim adopt rate for the devic is ani indic -- Amazon hasn't offici releas sale figures, but as of Januari 2016, Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) estim a stagger 8.2 million Echo have alreadi been sold in the U.S. (a number that pale in comparison to Morgan Stanley' estim of over 11 million), suggest the devic ha achiev well over 5% household penetr -- earli demand for a seamless comput experi is strong, and will like grow stronger as capabl competitor race to introduc their own offer (see Google' Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu' Littl Fish), and as voic recognition, natur languag understanding, and third-parti support continu improv at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figur are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devic will never replac today' exist comput mediums, but will rather augment them. While screen will remain the prefer medium for our more detail and visual comput needs, voic will begin it ascent by take on an increas share of our more ""conversational"" demands, common request we want address with the immediaci we expect from dialogu (""Cancel my doctor' appointment."" ""Paus that music!"" ""What' a good non-fict book to read on the beach? ... Great, order that one."")A the technolog grow capabl of handl increasingli nuanc and complex requests, and as voice-en devic prolifer and evolve, we can expect more user to grow comfort engag with the technolog around the home, in the workplace, and gradual more pervas aspect of society.Andthat'swher the real opportun begin.Th opportun at handSom of the biggest tech empir in modern histori have been built around the person computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which ha provid the infrastructur for technolog to penetr deeper and more reflex into everyday life, allow creativ compani to reach consum in entir new ways.In just 10 years, the iPhon help Appl grow to becom the largest corpor in the world, but it also popular smartphon technolog in the U.S., help to creat the infrastructur that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless other to creat busi that reach deeper into our live than ani before.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneAnd yet voic technolog is go deeper.It' becom an invisible, always-listen medium that surround us, weav itself more seamlessli into the fabric of our live than ani befor it.

Is This NVIDIA's Next Big Opportunity?;3/11/2017;"Imag source: NVIDIA.Gam isNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) biggest revenu sourc while the automot busi is said to be it nextbig play. However, the company' data center busi -- which hasAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as client -- is put both game and automot to shame in term of growth.makeArticleAd();Data from NVIDIA. Chart by author.Th 205% year-over-year growth in NVIDIA' data center revenu dure the fourth quarter eclips both game and automotive, which report ""moderate"" growth of 66% and 37%, respect over the same time period. Data center is the company' second-largest business, with over 13% of revenue, and it could continu to grow for two reasons: the deploy of more data center and upgrad to the exist ones.Data center will need more GPUsNowadays, the type and volum of inform that data center process ha becom more complex than ever. The grow usag of 3D applic in virtual workspac environ is creat the need for high-perform comput that is enabl by GPUs. Instead of deploy a 3D-graphics-en applic on an individu workstation, enterpris are now use the data center to instal the 3D app so they can be access by user remotely.Apart from the complexity, the volum of data process in data center is also rise thank to concept such as the Internet of Things.TheInternet of Thingsgener two categori of data. The first is the larg data type that consist of imag and video gener by differ electron devices. The second is the passiv or small data type that is gener by differ sensor and low-energi devic power the Internet of Things. As data center handl both these data types, they will need upgrad GPU to enhanc comput speed and control cost simultaneously.A it turn out, NVIDIA' Tesla GPU for the data center deliv on both count -- faster speed and lower costs. These are capabl of enhanc comput speed by five time and reduc cost by 60%, accord to Shanker Trivedi, the company' VP of Enterpris Business. The advantag deliv by these GPU have allow the compani to rack up an impress clientel in datacenters, especi in high-perform computing.NVIDIA' GPU are power major cloud servic provid such as Amazon Web Services,GoogleCloud, Microsoft Azure, and Softlayer. The company' client list in datacent will continu expand as global mobil data traffic is expect to grow eightfold from 2015 to 2020, driven by Internet of Thing applications.Th increas data traffic will spawn the need for more datacenters, with TechNavio forecast that the global data center market will grow 11% annual between 2016 and 2020. But, apart from the construct of new datacenters, NVIDIA will also benefit from the upgrad to the exist ones.Upgrad will drive GPU demandCloud servic provid have start upgrad their exist data center to meet the rise in data volum and tackl complexity. Amazon, for example, upgrad it servic use NVIDIA' Tesla GPU acceler late last year. Amazon Web Servic use eight Tesla accelerators, with each of them be power by a pair of GPUs.Th NVIDIA GPU were use to add a new virtual server, known as P2, to Amazon' data center. The new server carri seven time the comput capac of Amazon' previou platform, known as G2, which wa run a legaci GPU.Similarly, Microsoft ha also start offer a preview of NVIDIA' acceler data center solut on the Azur platform to give custom a tast of supercomputer-class performance. Azur client can now deploy profession grade graphic solut to remot workstat and acceler their comput speed over the cloud. In thi way, Microsoft is provid infrastructure-as-a-servic (IaaS) to it client by upgrad it exist data centers.Th Iaa market will be worth $43 billion in 2020 as compar to $22 billion last year, accord to IDC. Thi will increas the demand for NVIDIA' GPU as they will be use to acceler comput power and capac in data center to enabl Iaa growth.Th Foolish takeawayTh data center market is go to get bigger in the long run and NVIDIA count the biggest cloud servic provid as it clients. Thi will allow it to get more of it GPU into data center to enabl high-perform comput need and eventu boost it business.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Behind Kevin Plank's Plan to Disrupt Retail;3/10/2017;"Imag Source: Under ArmourUnd Armour(NYSE: UA) is one of mani retail today execut an omnichannel business, sell product in retail store and online. Under Armour' direct-to-consum (DTC) busi ha been grow at a healthi 31% per year for the last five years, and in Q4 wa 40% of the company' overal revenue.makeArticleAd();In the company' most recent earn call, CEO Kevin Plank talk candidli about what custom are demanding, how tradit retail is not meet the mark, and howjustinvest in e-commerc is not enough.Th custom demand moreBut retail is be disrupted...Th fact of the matter though is that the consumer, they expect more today. They expect speed and conveni and best price and value, and they expect it the next day.Plank' comment about retail be disrupt seem to be ""code"" for lose sale and relevance. He clearli recogn the ""Amazoneffect"" and how the e-commerc giant ha rais customer' expectations, but what is Under Armour' answer to the Amazon threat?So that choic of new and custom is someth that we need to react to and do a better job of. Thi idea though is we think that the cycl that we'r live in from retail and invent the next big thing, it' go to come from much closer to the concentr circle...Plank' quot is not easili decod unless you understand that he want to disrupt the apparel manufactur process, which ha been done the same way for thelast 100 years.Plank ha a grand vision of person product that are made in a local-for-local, high-tech manufactur facil like theLighthous projectin Baltimore. The idea is that you could get your foot scan and have a perform shoe made with the options, color, and fit that is perfect for you. But that' not enough, thi product need to be made local so that the deliveri time is minimal.Whil Plank' vision of the factori of the futur is a number of year away, the compani is invest heavili in the near term trend of e-commerce. But for Under Armour there' more to e-commerc than a cool websit and fast delivery.Invest in digit business, not just e-commerceA DTC relat to e-commerce, I don't know if anyon can imagin that they can put enough money toward their digit busi today.Plank chose hi word veri care here. At first glance, it seem that he is say ""put all your chip on the e-commerc trend,"" but he clearli said ""digit business."" Plank ha said ""data is the new oil,"" mean that, like oil, data can be ""refined"" to creat other valuabl products. Thi is where Under Armour' invest in connect fit come in.Connect Fitness...i an invest in our digit business, in our own direct-to-consum and e-commerce. And so we feel veri bullish, and we feel like we have realli uniqu posit unlik anyon els in our industry. And frankli I can't think of ani compani that have sort of that amount of data flow to understand their consum better. But as we think about the experi first and foremost, it' about have a great consum experience.Und Armour' four fit applic have 200 million user log fitness, food, and health data across the globe, which give the compani it ""uniqu positioning.""A thi data is distil through partnership withIBM' WatsonandSAP, it will provid Under Armour with valuabl insight into it customer, more than ani other fit company. In the end, Under Armour want to sell shirt and shoe with a great consum experi that can't be duplicated.Despit all thi there' a short-term problem that impact Under Armour' most recent quarterli result -- soft retail sale -- but Plank ha an answer for that too.E-commerc rollout is ahead of scheduleWhen Under Armour had it analyst day in Septemb 2015, the compani reveal it goal for global e-commerce. Plank want to have 30 e-commerc sites, offer local experiences, by 2018.Under Armour beat that goal, announc the 30th e-commerc site in it third quarter 2016 earn release. I can't help but think thi wa acceler due to the company' heavi depend on wholesal partner -- which result in the compani have less price and inventori control. To understand Plank' perspective, we need to go back to the rest of the ""retail is be disrupted"" quote.But retail is be disrupted, and so whether it wa what we saw in 2016 and frankli some of the indic we'v seen with some of the file go into 2017, so we need to be proactiv with that and be thought about that...In 2016, wholesal partner account for 65% of Under Armour' revenue, which is whi Plank want to reduc depend on thi sale channel. The acceler of thi initi could be hedg against retail soft in the future, but it could suggest more. Plank discuss the role of e-commerc to facilit sales, whether it' onlin or not.It' about when peopl show up [online], excit them and help them choos to transact, and do it in a way which either; a, forc them to get up and go to brick and mortar; or b, it help them choos to transact on a phone. And so when I describ our DTC business, I think about e-commerce, full price, and outlet. And probabl as recent as a year to two year ago, I'd probabl give those in full price, out, and then e-commerce.Plank ha reorder the prioriti for DTC to put e-commerc first. Thi is a smart move given the continu growth of the onlin sale channel. Under Armour doesn't split out DTC revenu into e-commerc versu brick-and-mortar, so investor (and competitors) are left wonder how much each is contributing. Time will tell whether Plank is put hi money where is mouth is, but I am confid he is.Bottom lineUnd Armour is invest heavili in it digit busi and e-commerc capabilities, collect more data on it custom than anyon els in the industry. While retail as a whole is be disrupted, Under Armour is attempt a disrupt of the apparel manufactur industry. Plank found Under Armour with an innov t-shirt over 20 year ago and continu to innov to thi day. Investor should be excit to watch what Under Armour will do in the next 20 years.10 stock we like better than Under Armour (C Shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Best Buy Survived While RadioShack Has Been to Bankruptcy Court Twice;3/10/2017;"RadioShack ha file for bankruptci protect for a second time, with the company' owner immedi close 200 stores, and consid it option for the remain 1,300 it owns. At roughli the same time,Best Buy(NYSE: BBY) , anoth electron retailer, ha turn the corner in it battl for survival. It earn per share (EPS) rose dramatically, climb from $2.30 in fiscal 2016 to $3.74 in the chain' fiscal 2017. In addition, it stock, which is current trade around $45, ha more than tripl sinc bottom out in late 2012.That wa enough for Best Buy CEO Hubert Joli to liter declar the company' turnaround effort over.makeArticleAd();""Sinc the introduct of Renew Blue in Novemb 2012, we have improv the oper perform of the busi dramatically,"" he said in the Q4 earn releas in earli March. ""We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue offici over and launch our strategi for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Build the New Blue.""Thos comment were releas a week befor RadioShack onc again sought bankruptci protection, rais the question as to whi one electron chain ha succeed while the other ha failed. It' not a simpl answer, as you will see below that both chain made mani of the same moves.Best Buy ha come back from the brink. Imag source: Best Buy.What did Best Buy do?Launch in 2012, Renew Blue wa a road map to help Best Buy turn around it fortunes. At the time the plan wa introduced, Best Buy was, like RadioShack, on the list of compani mani expect to not survive, larg due to the internet andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) specifically. It turnaround began becaus the compani systemat attack it weak while build on it strengths.On key weak wa the fact that consum did not see Best Buy as offer attract prices. In a report the compani share in it Renew Bluepresent deck[open in PDF], onli 23% of consum perceiv Best Buy as have lower price than it rival while 56% of Amazon custom saw the onlin retail that way and 71% ofWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) custom believ it had the lowest prices.Best Buy aggress address that by offer a price match program that let peopl pay the same price they would at top onlin competitor and ""local retailers,"" a categori that includ Wal-Mart. That one move immedi remov the incent for showrooming, that is, the practic of do your research on a product at Best Buy but buy onlin or from anoth retailer.In addit to that major move, Best Buy did a number of things:It launch an intern program to lower cost through what Joli describ as ""disciplin promot strategy, continu optim of merchandis margin and strong expens management."" Those effort target $400 million in potenti annual save by 2018, about half of which it ha alreadi delivered.Th compani built on the idea of it store as destin shop by ad store-within-a-stor concept from major partner includingApple,Samsung,Microsoft, andSony.Best Buy increas focu on it Geek Squad service, a differenti from other sellers.Th chain also devot resourc to improv it digit shop experi includ move to one-click checkout and offer more item (some that are not in it stores) through it website.Taken on it own, ani one of these move would probabl have not been enough, but made togeth they left Best Buy with price-competit store that consum had more reason to visit and a robust, easy-to-us digit presence.Wher did RadioShack drop the ball?A a privat compani it' hard to see exactli what the second iter of RadioShack did differ than the previou publicli trade version. The compani did partner withSprint(NYSE: S) on some locations, but the wireless carrier (which also ha a presenc at Best Buy) may not have been the custom draw that Best Buy' store-within-a-stor partner prove to be. In fact, in it bankruptci filing, RadioShack cite ""the surprisingli poor perform of mobil sales,"" i.e. Sprint, as a reason for it have to file,USA Todayreported.Th compani did not price match and it website, while it got some attention, wa not made a prioriti in the way Best Buy' was. RadioShack also fail to articul ani clear reason for peopl to visit it store asid from it long-stand function as a nearbi option when you'r miss cabl or batteri and have them now trump price in your mind.However, CEO Dene Roger did share some info in the company' press releas on the bankruptci that shed some light on the step it did take.""In 2016, we reduc oper expens by 23%, while at the same time saw gross profit dollar increas 8%,"" he said. ""Over the same time, we integr FedEx pickup/drop-off into 140 RadioShack locations, deliv to custom over 700,000 Hulu login pin and sold more than a million RadioShack privat brand headphon and speaker deliv high quality, value-bas audio product to consum across the country.""Mayb RadioShack had no chanceRadioShack manag made some of the same move that Best Buy did, yet it still failed. Some of that may be becaus it bet too heavili on Sprint as a partner. In addition, do noth to address consum expect on price certainli sent some busi to Amazon, Wal-Mart, and even Best Buy.In the end, though, RadioShack may have been doom by the fact that small, limited-select store are not the draw they onc were now that peopl can simpli go onlin and get nearli anyth they need with two-day delivery. With the averag RadioShack be roughli 2,400 squar feet, it simpli can't compet with destin chain like Best Buy that are 10 to 15 time larger on average.In it heyday, RadioShack succeed becaus it mani locat made it conveni for custom and it sold product that were interest to look at, with mani not be offer elsewhere. Add in be a sourc for thing like blank cassettes, VH tapes, and other accessories, the compani fill a nich that doe not exist ani more.RadioShack ha fail while Best Buy live on to continu battl Amazon, becaus it may have outliv it use without find a new reason for being. Perhap there wa a pivot that could have save the retail (and mayb Blockbust would still exist if it had becom a chain of liquor store/vap shops) but non-extrem measur were alway like to end in thi result.10 stock we like better than Best BuyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings;3/10/2017;"While I'm a big believ in diversif and current hold posit in more than70 individu stocks, my portfolio is actual more concentr than you might assume. In fact, my top three hold --Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Intuit Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG) , andTh Pricelin Group(NASDAQ: PCLN) -- current compris more than 21% of my portfolio' total value.Whi have I allow these three compani to make up so much of my net worth? Below is an overview that explain whi I'm so bullish.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th Pricelin Group -- 6% of my portfolioIt took me quit some time to warm up to the idea of invest in The Pricelin Group. After all, consum have hundr of onlin travel site to choos from when they want to book a vacation. That' whi I had a hard time figur out what made thi company' site so differ from all the others.I final learn the answer to that question in 2010, and I start to accumul share in the compani that year. The Pricelin Group' golden goos wa a site call Booking.com, which the compani had acquir in 2005. Thi site had a runaway lead in the European hotel market, have spent year to build out it network. That decis prove to be a stroke of geniu sinc mani European hotel are mom-and-pop operations, not franchis own by the big boys.Bi amass the biggest collect of hotels, Booking.com earn a reput among travel as the go-to site if they want to maxim their selection. In turn, hotel learn that they need to be on Booking.com' network in order to attract customers. That unleash a power network effect that ha help to keep exist custom loyal while also attract new user to the platform.Given that onlin travel repres onlya tini fractionof the total travel market at the time, I realiz that The Pricelin Group still had amassiveamount of room for futur growth. I wound up buy share on multipl occasions, and my averag cost basi is around $385. With share current trade for more than $1,700 each, thi stock ha turn out to be one of my biggest winners.Despit it huge run, the Pricelin Group showsno sign of slow down. That make it one of my highest-convict stock that I do not plan on part way with anytim soon.Intuit Surgical-- 6% of my portfolioI wa lucki enough to land a job in the sale and market depart of a fast-grow medic devic compani right out of college. I wound up devot more than a decad of my life to tri to convinc healthcar provid to use a differ product in their daili life. That turn out to befarmor difficult than I thought it wa go to be. The primari reason wa that mani provid are set in their way and are veri reluct to tri someth new. That tendenc give the market-shar leader a massiv competit advantag over rivals.Given that firsthand experience, I wa blown away to learn what Intuit Surgic ha accomplished. Thi compani pioneer the use of robot in the surgic set with it groundbreak da Vinci system. In just over a decade, thi system ha becom the standard-of-car treatment for a number of procedures, includ hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and more. That' help drive sale of da Vinci system ever higher, which ha power huge growth in the company' top and bottom lines.ISRG Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.I start buy Intuitive' stock in 2010 and have ad regularli to my posit over the last few years. My averag cost basi is now around $365. With share current trade for $740 each, the valu of my invest ha alreadi more than doubled. That' turn thi stock into my No. 2 overal holding.Despit it past success, I'm still wildli bullish on thi company' future. Intuitive' massiv instal base of 3,919 da Vinci machin give it a huge leg up overpotenti rivals. The compani is alsoinvest heavilyin new product and procedur that promis to further widen it moat. That should ensur that thi compani remain on top for decad to come, which is whi I plan on stick around for the long term.Amazon.com -- 9% of my portfolioAmazon.com wa anoth stock that took me far too long to final buy. While I wa a happi custom for years, thi company' noseble P/E ratio had long kept me on the sidelines. Even though I knew that e-commerc still had a long runway ahead of it, my value-investor tendenc kept me from becom a shareholder.That prove to be a monument stupid decision. I sat idli by as Amazon continu to take over the world. Share continu to roar higher without me.Thankfully, in 2010, I final decid to bite the bullet and becom an owner. I commit to a simpledollar-cost averagingstrategi and purchas share on 26 separ occas over the next four years. Even though I wa constantli buy the stock at 52-week highs, my averag cost basi is onli $190. With share current trade for $840 each, buy ""high"" actual prove to be a highli profit decision.Despit it massiv size, Amazon continu to look pois for growth. Global e-commerc sale in 2016 were $1.9trillionwhil Amazon ""only"" pull in $136 billion in annual sales. That give the compani a worldwid market share of 7%. Meanwhile, the total e-commerc pie is expect tomor than doubleov the next four years.

5 Stocks With Promising, Amazon-like Growth Potential;3/9/2017;"It isn't hard to figur out whyAmazon.comha been one of the best-perform stock over the past two decades. The e-commerc giant' top line ha grown like wildfir sinc it found in 1994 as more consum warm up to the idea of shop online. In turn, investor have bid up share on the hope that the company' massiv revenu growth will translat into huge profit growth, too.So what other compani could potenti grow at a breakneck speed over the next few decades? We ask a team of Fool that veri question, and they pickedMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) ,WisdomTre Investments(NASDAQ: WETF) ,Illumina(NASDAQ: ILMN) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) . Read on to find out why.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Look south for great growthDan Caplinger(MercadoLibre):To look for Amazon-lik growth potential, it make sens to stay in the same arena that Amazon serv while search for a nich that the onlin retail giant hasn't yet sought to cover. MercadoLibr ha that appeal, as it ha set out to becom the primari e-commerc giant serv the Latin American region. With hundr of million of potenti custom in a rapidli grow part of the emerg world, Latin America give MercadoLibr plenti of upsid potential.MercadoLibr ha done a lot to build up an entir ecosystem to facilit internet commerce. Start with it premier marketplac site, MercadoLibr later ad a varieti of add-on services, includ it MercadoPago payment system, MercadoEnvio for shipping, and a servic to allow purchas to get financ on what they buy when necessary. These ancillari busi provid a full-servic experi for MercadoLibr users, but they also have the potenti to becom independ success in their own right and expand into more applications.MercadoLibr doe face the challeng of deal with more volatil econom conditions. For instance, in recent years, Latin America larg miss out on the econom growth that the U.S. ha enjoyed, becaus of fall commod prices. That filter through to MercadoLibre' prospects. However, with commod start to bounc higher, MercadoLibr ha post solid growth, and the runway for the e-commerc giant span a long way into the future.Sight set on the futureRich Duprey(NVIDIA):Aft the run-up in valu NVIDIA ha had over the past few years, rise some 600% sinc 2014, it' easi to think it stock is price for perfection. As it trade at 62 time trail earn and 44 time forward estimates, it' understand whi some are concern about valuation. But at time some compani deserv the heighten expect -- becaus their busi are that good.Th depth and breadth of the graphics-chip maker' portfolio give it a huge competit advantag over rivalsIntelandAdvanc Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) , drive it lead GPU segment to exceed the market' growth. Notably, the segment is enjoy rapid adopt in AI, the cloud, gaming, and self-driv vehicles. That show it import not onli in it mainstay game market, but also in the auto market, in the Internet of Things, and as part of devic that are push the boundari of virtual realiti and machin learning. GPU are perhap at the core of the wave of the future: deep learn that will liter drive the driverless cars, advanc healthcare, and more.NVIDIA' leadership ha come at the expens of Intel and AMD, but make no mistake: It' still game that is the moneymak here, account for more than 60% of total revenu as it GeForc GPU continu to fuel strong adopt of it Pascal architecture. AMD' Polari processor may help lift it performance, but they still lag far behind NVIDIA' offerings.Th chipmak may have to do everyth right, but it' prove that it is capabl of do so, and it routin exce even it own forecast of growth. It expect fourth-quart revenu to come in at $1.9 billion, give or take, which would be a nearli 50% year-over-year increas -- a goal well within it reach.No compani can grow continu in a straight line, and there will be hiccup along the way for NVIDIA, but there' no reason to think that, even if investor get nervou again, the strength of it busi won't be abl to continu drive it higher to achiev Amazon-lik growth.A genomic-sequenc leaderBrian Feroldi(Illumina):Whil the human genom wa first decod more than a decad ago, I'd bet that you still haven't had your DNA sequenced. That' becaus it still cost more than $1,000 to do so, which is a price tag that is still too high to drive mass adoption.However, I'd bet that you will have your genom sequenc in the next decad or so as cost continu to fall. If I'm right, then Illumina -- a lead provid of genomic-test equip -- look pois for massiv growth from here.Illumina is the domin player in the genomic-sequenc market. The compani sell both the machin that sequenc the DNA and the suppli that are need to run each test. Thi razor-and-blad model ha allow Illumina' revenu to rise rapidli even while the cost of perform a test ha fallen dramatically. Here' a great chart that show thi phenomenon in action:Imag source: Illumina. CAGR = Compound annual growth rate.Recently, Illumina stun the market with the launch of it NovaSeq series, which is a next-gener test system that promis to drive down the cost of sequenc a genom toa littl as $100. With a price point that low, I could easili see thi technolog go mainstream.But what can healthcar provid do with the inform gather through DNA sequencing? To help find out, Illumina ha team up withIBMandPhilipsto creat new tool that will standard and simplifi data interpretation. If successful, the project could help provid identifi diseas at far earlier stage than current technolog allows.In total, Illumina' new technolog could help to revolution the world of healthcar as we know it today. If thi pan out, then Illumina could be pois to deliv decad of top- and bottom-lin growth.Th futur is bright for First SolarJasonHall(First Solar):Solar and renew energi stock are like to get trash in the near term, as Presid Donald Trump' administr make good on hi campaign promis to cut regulations. And while a lot of investor money will shift away from renew and chase after the compani that could benefit in the short term, the long term remain in the favor of compani like First Solar.Thi is because, even as the Trump administr announc plan to cut emiss regul across the transportation, automotive, and util industri in the Unit States, the rest of the develop world is put more emphasi on renewables. And with the bulk of global popul expans -- particularli in the energy-consum middl class -- happen outsid North America over the next sever decades, don't let local polit cloud your view when it come to the growth prospect for First Solar. After all, the compani alreadi deriv nearli half of it busi outsid North America.There' a good chanc the market will remain veri unfavor on First Solar' stock in the short term. But look out year down the road, billion of new global middle-class member will be reli on solar all over the world, no matter what U.S. polit and regul look like. If you'r will to ride out short-term choppi complet unrel to the big picture, and potenti get Amazon-lik returns, First Solar is a great stock to own.A bet on index fundsJordan Wathen(WisdomTre Investments):WisdomTre Invest current domin in an obscur corner of the index fund world. WisdomTree' most popular fund allow you to invest in Japanes and European stock without expos yourself to currenc risk.Th bad news is that investor have turn cold on the strategy. The company' currency-hedg funds, which held about $39.2 billion in asset at their peak in the second quarter of 2015, end the fourth quarter of 2016 with just $18.8 billion in assets. As the dollar strengthened, investor now want to bet on a weaker dollar, a bet that WisdomTre fund aren't particularli use for.Luckily, the compani ha a few other emerg strategies. It domest dividend fund are proven winner and have been excel asset gatherers. It ha also expand abroad to start new exchange-trad fund in market that aren't as satur with ETF as American stock exchanges.I see WisdomTre as someth of a lotteri ticket in an industri that should see it asset under manag grow at a high-single-digit clip for a long time to come. For a lever compani like WisdomTree, that can easili turn into year of double-digit earn growth.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The situat may not chang much in the near term. The risk should be hedg howev as Amazon Web Servic (AWS) increas in the mix.

AW is still a small percentag of Amazon' total business, but still ha a signific impact on it profit becaus of the low-margin profil of the retail business.

Moreover, the compani ha a world-class platform which help it win thi business.However, for Amazon, competit in onlin retail ha been heat up. Tradit retail have alway provid the strongest competit and a number of them are run e-commerc site as well. Additionally, the increas use of the Internet in both develop and develop economi ha attract other player to the space. While big player like eBayEBAYhav start use affili programs, sever smaller compani could also find their own niche.Though the Chines market is ripe and Amazon look to increas penetr in the market, local compani Alibaba.comBABAi veri well-entrench there.

Know Amazon' relentless focu on steadili deliv new featur and deal to it Prime customers, Amazon could offer special discount to Prime member for use Amazon payments.PayPal' competit advantageDespit these appar advantages, Amazon ha been rather quiet about it payment service. Thi could reflect Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos' polici to keep quiet about all invest within the compani to prevent prowl competitor from know too much. But it could also reflect other compet invest within the company.Pay is not mention much on earn confer call by either analyst or management. Amazon is spend billion expand it distribut infrastructure, blanket the U.S. with it massiv fulfil centers, and expand around the world, especi in India. There are also other project like drone delivery, Prime video content, Amazon bookstores, and Amazon Web Services.Amazon ha a lot go on, wherea PayPal is pure focus on payment solutions.Whil Amazon Payment is still not offer by mani larg retailers, PayPal ha been quickli signingpartnershipswith credit card compani and bank to spread it payment servic to as mani point-of-sal locat as possible.PayP also ha a first-mov advantag over Amazon. The compani ha sign up 200 million custom account as oppos to Amazon' 33 million who have use Pay with Amazon. The size and momentum of PayPal' busi give it a tremend advantag over Amazon payments.On valid of PayPal' advantag is CEO Dan Schulman' recent disclosur that hi compani and Amazon have been in discuss about a potenti partnership. Thi not onli point to PayPal' strong posit in the payment market, but it also reveal that payment is not Amazon' main focus.PayP and Amazon will probabl play niceAt the heart of Amazon' busi strategi is it drive to be customer-centric, and thi put Amazon in a tough spot. Amazon is tri to grow it payment service, but at the same time, Amazon manag must recogn that there are custom who would like to pay with PayPal instead of store payment inform on Amazon.Most of these custom are like not Amazon Prime customers, which have made up most of Amazon' payment volume. Prime custom are veri lock in to the Amazon ecosystem and are like comfort with store payment inform on Amazon as a result. The valu PayPal bring to Amazon is a way to expand Amazon' reach to non-Prim customers.For all of the awesom growth of Amazon' busi over the last 20 years, e-commerc still make up less than 10% of retail sale in the U.S. alone. There are still million of peopl in the U.S. who haven't sign up for Prime yet, or who have hardli shop on Amazon.Off PayPal as a checkout option would probabl not matter much to Amazon' growth. It would like benefit PayPal more than Amazon, which is whi a deal may not come to fruition. Still, Amazon' core busi is retail, not payments. In the end, Amazon is more interest in sell whatev it custom want to buy, and that could mean see PayPal more as a partner, as oppos to a rival.An exampl of thi strategi alreadi in practic isApple. PayPal compet with Appl Pay, but at the same time, Appl offer PayPal as a payment option in iTunes.Ther is a huge market opportun for all payment providersTri to understand whi these compani are partner while simultan compet with each other can be confusing.On answer is to rememb the size of the market opportun for these companies. PayPal manag put the market opportun at $100 trillion. Think about that for a second. I don't think I'v ever heard of a market opportun approach anyth close to that by ani other company. The payment market is a wide-open space with plenti of room for sever compet servic to grow for a long time.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

The 8 Most Dangerous Investing Mistakes;3/9/2017;"Stock have been on a tear sinc Donald Trump' election. And the bull market celebr it eighth birthday thi week. But even in a market that goe almost straight up, it' import to avoid pitfalls. Here are some mistak I'v watch investor make repeatedly. Alas, I'v made a few of them myself.Se Also:7 Biggest Mistak Investor Make1. Get spook by the bearsTher are alway solid reason whi the stock market should go down. Some of the smartest peopl I know are almost alway bearish. But I think the investor who do best in the market tend to ignor mani of the bearish indic and, instead, stick to their long-term stock allocations. Over time, the market ha gone up about two of everi three years, on averag -- and that' go back more than 100 years. You have to have a power reason to bet against those odds.2. Ignor fund volatilityIn a bull market, take extra risk gener pay off. But in bear markets, high volatil amplifi your pain. What' more, academ studi have shown that risk-adjust return are more predict of futur return than raw returns. You can find risk-adjust fund return at Morningstar.com. Just click on 'Rate and Risk,"" and look at standard deviat -- which measur the volatil of a fund' monthli return over three, five and 10 year -- and Sharp ratio, which measur the risk-adjust return over those same periods.makeArticleAd();Consid one of my mistakes. Bridgeway Aggress Investor 1 (BRAGX) use to be one of my favorit funds. But in the 2007-2009 bear market, it tumbl 64.4%, compar with a 55.3% loss for Standard & Poor' 500-stock index. The fund ha done well again lately, return an annual 14.8% over the past five years, an averag of 0.8 percentag point better than the S&P 500. But Bridgeway wa 35% more volatil than the S&P over the past three years, and I would prefer not to risk outsiz loss in the next downturn. (All price and return in thi articl are through March 8.)3. Pay too muchI love Amazon.com (AMZN). I'v practic ceas go to store becaus it' so much easier and less expens to just click a few buttons. I read book on a Kindl and watch Amazon video. It' not the stock' price, $851, that scare me. It' that the share trade at 110 time the company' estim earn for the come 12 months. That' more than six time the price-earn ratio for the overal market. Yes, I know that the compani is still grow like a weed and that the narrow profit margin on it main busi should widen, eventually. But the share alreadi reflect a ton of good news. For the stock to continu higher, it will have to do even better than investor expect. I'm pass on Amazon at thi price.Tak Our Quiz:Test Your Invest IQ4. Pay too much (part two)It' true that for a lot of things, you get what you pay for -- meaning, high qualiti usual come with a high price tag. But in investing, you gener get what you don't pay for. Studi after studi ha come to the same conclusion: The higher a fund' expens ratio, the lower it return is like to be. The averag U.S. open-end mutual fund charg 1.2% of asset in expens annually. But lot of index funds--both exchange-trad and mutual -- cost less than 0.1% per year. Ani high-pric fund start with a huge disadvantage. Some except fund manag to overcom that hurdle, but cheaper is usual better.5. Follow the gurusDon't confus a spectacular long-term record with an abil to forecast the future. Investor Georg Soro lost nearli $1 billion when he bet that the stock market would tank follow Donald Trump' election. The experts, unfortunately, often get it wrong. Ignor prognost from the pundits, includ the peopl I interview for thi column, unless they demonstr sound reason for their conclusions. Even then, take what they say with a grain of salt. No one know which way the market will head next.6. Leav everyth up to an adviserTher are good reason for investor to use a financi adviser, but all investor should take the time to understand the market. It realli isn't that complicated. There' noth import in invest that requir more than simpl arithmetic. But that doesn't stop invest firm from come up with complex and confus products. Mani of the mistak I'v made have come from invest in thing I didn't fulli understand. Moreover, if you understand the basics, it' a lot easier to keep your advis honest.7. Hold on to a winner too longA stock' rise tell you where it ha been. It doesn't say a thing about how it will behav in the future. That seem obvious, but as with so much that goe wrong in investing, our emot lead us astray. Tri to tell someon to sell an invest that ha done well is often veri difficult. I know the glow you feel when you'v watch a stock you own skyrocket. But the higher a stock, a fund or the market goes, other thing be equal, the more expens it get and the bigger the risk of a chang in direction.8. Wait too long to sell a loserThi is the flip side of the previou mistake. Numer studi have shown that investor tend to sell their winner too earli and hold onto their loser too long. The reason: It' exceedingli pain to realiz a loss, and as long as you hold onto a stock, you can delay that pain. My advice: If you wouldn't buy a stock today, sell it, now, and move on.Stev Goldbergi an invest advis in the Washington, D.C., area.Se Also:10 Great Stock for the Next 10 Year"

The Best Performing ETFs of the Bull Market Might Surprise You;3/8/2017;"Eight year ago, the S&P 500 hit it Great Recess close low, and sinc then, equiti around the globe have been soaring. In fact, an S&P 500 invest on March 10th2009 of $10,000 would have been worth over $40,000 today if you had been reinvest dividend (accord to data from Morningstar).But what were the best perform fund in thi time frame? High-fli biotechs? Microcap stock with big growth potential? Actually, among the best perform were value-focus funds. In particular, the most value-centr product of all were the leaders.Pur ValueOf the top ten unleverag ETF sinc the bull market began, three are actual 'pure value' fund from Guggenheim. Guggenheim' entrant in thi market includ the MidCap 400 Pure Valu ETF (RFV) which wa number seven on the list, and then the Small Cap 600 Pure Valu ETF (RZV) in the silver metal spot, and then the S&P 500 Pure Valu ETF (RPV) at number one overall. In fact, RZV and RPV have each turn a $10,000 invest into over $73,000 each sinc the start of the bull market run over the past eight years, crush a 'standard' invest inSPYin the process.A you can see in the chart of the top ten below, thi focu on valu would have also beaten the vast major of ETF in the market. Thi includ the entir world of semiconductor ETF such as SOXX, or ani REIT ETF such as VNQ as well, as these are both absent from the top ten, though they too have beaten the S&P 500 in the time frame.And while mid-cap 'lagged' a bit rel to the absolut apex of the ETF world, the top perform of RPV and RZV did edg out the Internet ETF from PowerShar (PNQI) and First Trust (FDN), and the biotech world with their top entrant of FBT too. So, how did thi pure valu concept manag to outperform against all odds, and over the rest of the valu space as well?What' So Differ About 'Pure'?Th Guggenheim ETF may have been abl to crush their competitor due to their more stringent methodolog which look to avoid overlap between the growth and valu worlds. Thi is what make the funds, accord to Guggenheim at least, 'pure' valu or 'pure' growth choices.Thi is import becaus mani fund in the valu and growth ETF world have signific overlap between the styles, at least for mani providers. By that I mean, a stock that is in the valu fund might also be in the growth fund too.W see thi in SPDR' entrant in the market;SLYVfor valu andSLYGfor growth. Each track a subset of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, and each ha over 330 stock in their funds. In other words, some stock which are in SLYV also find their way into SLYG. Arguably, thi allow less value-ori stock into a portfolio, though it definit promot diversif in the process.Lack of OverlapGuggenheim, on the other hand, restrict stock to either the 'value' or the 'growth' segment for their funds. Thi result in just over 110 stock go into their value-focus S&P 500 fund, and a similar amount for the growth version. And as simpl math will show you, roughli half of the 500 stock do not make it into either growth or valu benchmark at all, leav the Guggenheim fund arguabl more focus on top-notch valu or growth secur as a result.Thi approach seem to be a key differ for the fund compar to other valu ETFs, while the weight method probabl assist in the process too. That is because, for the valu fund, the product will look to weight stock by favor in term of Price/Book ratios, sales/pric ratios, and earnings/pric ratio as well. Still, we should note that Guggenheim isn't the onli one that ha a more focus approach, as some of iShares' product do as well.In fact, the valu ETF that came in second (at least as far as valu ETF alon are concerned) wa the iShar Morningstar Small Cap Valu ETF (JKL) which turn $10,000 to over $55,000 in the eight year bull. Thi fund, along with the Morningstar style box-focus ETF lineup, look at index that put stock into one of three buckets; value, growth, or core. So,overlap isn't an issu here, much like with the Guggenheim lineup.However, Morningstar' index system put a bit more compon into a given style. JKL contain over 240 compani in it basket, and thi is actual pretti compar to what we see with their core fund and their growth fund too. Thi mean that Morningstar look for balanc among the three styles, arguabl (onc again) put a bit lower qualiti valu stock into the basket as a result.So, it appear that at least for thi most recent and current bull run, the more the focu wa on value, the better it wa for investors.Valu Isn't Dead, It Is ThrivingMuch ha been made about the death of valu invest in recent years, but clearli thi approach still hold plenti of promise. And while some growthier segment have done pretti well-such as in the technolog world with the Internet industry' PNQI and FDN, or Biotech' FBT-valu ha been an extrem strong perform over long time frames.So, the next time someon tell you that valu invest doesn't work in today' market, consid the top perform from the bull market run. Sure, some high-fli fund make the list, but these have been larg driven by the stun perform from giant such as Amazon (AMZN) or Pricelin (PCLN).A $10,000 invest in Amazon at the start of the bull market would be worth over $130,000 today, while a $10,000 invest into Pricelin would be worth an astound $220,000 right now. To think that such insan return will happen again to either of these same compani or other larg cap tech stocks, appear to be misguided. Instead, it seem as though a tried-and-tru approach which focus on the absolut best valu stock in the market could be among the best way for investor to profit in the long-term.W key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>All return data from Morningstar, perform is from 3/10/09 - 3/7/17Want the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

Why Alphabet and Microsoft Should Start Disclosing Cloud Revenue;3/8/2017;"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is current host it Googl Cloud Next '17 develop conference, which kick off earlier today in San Francisco and run through March 10. Speak at the event, Googl CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he see Googl Cloud as an incred import part of the search giant' future, and not just one of the company' mani side bets. ""To me, Googl Cloud is a natur extens of our mission to make the world' inform access and usable,"" Pichai said.Th distinct is that while search help regular user access information, cloud comput infrastructur and the relat value-ad servic like analyt help the enterpris organ and access their information. The cloud infrastructur market is booming, grow 49% last year to $38.1 billion, accord to market research Canalys. It' expect to jump anoth 46% thi year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so, too, doe the impact on the financi of the major players: Googl Cloud,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Googl data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Imag source: Google.makeArticleAd();A such, the former two should start disclos exactli how much cloud revenu they'r bring in.Follow Amazon' leadI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon wa lead the way in investor transparency, given the e-commerc giant' long-stand refus to share variou oper metric that are pertin to investors. Yet, when it come to AW and cloud revenue, Amazon is do just that; Amazon start share AW financi in 2015. AW revenu wa $12.2 billion last year, translat into $3.1 billion in oper income.Microsoft onli disclos growth rate for Azur (up 93% last quarter), but lack a base number, that data point is less meaningful. We do know that total revenu in Microsoft' intellig cloud segment, which includ Azur among other offerings, wa $6.9 billion last quarter, result in $2.4 billion in oper income. Lack an offici figure, JPMorgan analyst estim Azur revenu for all of 2016 wa $2.7 billion, which would make AW nearli five time bigger.Googl includ Googl Cloud revenu within it Googl other revenu segment, which gener a hair over $10 billion in sale in 2016. That also includ revenu from Googl Play as well as the company' grow hardwar portfolio. One particularli promin Googl Cloud custom that just went public like spent between $400 million to $450 million last year, and is commit to $400 million per year for thenext five years, so there' that.Shar is caringY could reason argu that AW is far more import to Amazon than it peers' respect cloud businesses, though, specif sinc AW is by far the market leaderandit' such a major contributor to profit due to razor-thin margin in the core e-commerc business. In contrast, Googl and Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each special in softwar and services.Still, the cloud infrastructur market is onli go to becom increasingli import in the year ahead, and investor will want to see the result from the three largest player to assess each company' competitiveness. Googl and Microsoft should start share more, especi if it' as import as Pichai say it is.10 stock we like better than AlphabetWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 8 Most Dangerous Investing Mistakes;3/9/2017;"Stock have been on a tear sinc Donald Trump' election. And the bull market celebr it eighth birthday thi week. But even in a market that goe almost straight up, it' import to avoid pitfalls. Here are some mistak I'v watch investor make repeatedly. Alas, I'v made a few of them myself.Se Also:7 Biggest Mistak Investor Make1. Get spook by the bearsTher are alway solid reason whi the stock market should go down. Some of the smartest peopl I know are almost alway bearish. But I think the investor who do best in the market tend to ignor mani of the bearish indic and, instead, stick to their long-term stock allocations. Over time, the market ha gone up about two of everi three years, on averag -- and that' go back more than 100 years. You have to have a power reason to bet against those odds.2. Ignor fund volatilityIn a bull market, take extra risk gener pay off. But in bear markets, high volatil amplifi your pain. What' more, academ studi have shown that risk-adjust return are more predict of futur return than raw returns. You can find risk-adjust fund return at Morningstar.com. Just click on 'Rate and Risk,"" and look at standard deviat -- which measur the volatil of a fund' monthli return over three, five and 10 year -- and Sharp ratio, which measur the risk-adjust return over those same periods.makeArticleAd();Consid one of my mistakes. Bridgeway Aggress Investor 1 (BRAGX) use to be one of my favorit funds. But in the 2007-2009 bear market, it tumbl 64.4%, compar with a 55.3% loss for Standard & Poor' 500-stock index. The fund ha done well again lately, return an annual 14.8% over the past five years, an averag of 0.8 percentag point better than the S&P 500. But Bridgeway wa 35% more volatil than the S&P over the past three years, and I would prefer not to risk outsiz loss in the next downturn. (All price and return in thi articl are through March 8.)3. Pay too muchI love Amazon.com (AMZN). I'v practic ceas go to store becaus it' so much easier and less expens to just click a few buttons. I read book on a Kindl and watch Amazon video. It' not the stock' price, $851, that scare me. It' that the share trade at 110 time the company' estim earn for the come 12 months. That' more than six time the price-earn ratio for the overal market. Yes, I know that the compani is still grow like a weed and that the narrow profit margin on it main busi should widen, eventually. But the share alreadi reflect a ton of good news. For the stock to continu higher, it will have to do even better than investor expect. I'm pass on Amazon at thi price.Tak Our Quiz:Test Your Invest IQ4. Pay too much (part two)It' true that for a lot of things, you get what you pay for -- meaning, high qualiti usual come with a high price tag. But in investing, you gener get what you don't pay for. Studi after studi ha come to the same conclusion: The higher a fund' expens ratio, the lower it return is like to be. The averag U.S. open-end mutual fund charg 1.2% of asset in expens annually. But lot of index funds--both exchange-trad and mutual -- cost less than 0.1% per year. Ani high-pric fund start with a huge disadvantage. Some except fund manag to overcom that hurdle, but cheaper is usual better.5. Follow the gurusDon't confus a spectacular long-term record with an abil to forecast the future. Investor Georg Soro lost nearli $1 billion when he bet that the stock market would tank follow Donald Trump' election. The experts, unfortunately, often get it wrong. Ignor prognost from the pundits, includ the peopl I interview for thi column, unless they demonstr sound reason for their conclusions. Even then, take what they say with a grain of salt. No one know which way the market will head next.6. Leav everyth up to an adviserTher are good reason for investor to use a financi adviser, but all investor should take the time to understand the market. It realli isn't that complicated. There' noth import in invest that requir more than simpl arithmetic. But that doesn't stop invest firm from come up with complex and confus products. Mani of the mistak I'v made have come from invest in thing I didn't fulli understand. Moreover, if you understand the basics, it' a lot easier to keep your advis honest.7. Hold on to a winner too longA stock' rise tell you where it ha been. It doesn't say a thing about how it will behav in the future. That seem obvious, but as with so much that goe wrong in investing, our emot lead us astray. Tri to tell someon to sell an invest that ha done well is often veri difficult. I know the glow you feel when you'v watch a stock you own skyrocket. But the higher a stock, a fund or the market goes, other thing be equal, the more expens it get and the bigger the risk of a chang in direction.8. Wait too long to sell a loserThi is the flip side of the previou mistake. Numer studi have shown that investor tend to sell their winner too earli and hold onto their loser too long. The reason: It' exceedingli pain to realiz a loss, and as long as you hold onto a stock, you can delay that pain. My advice: If you wouldn't buy a stock today, sell it, now, and move on.Stev Goldbergi an invest advis in the Washington, D.C., area.Se Also:10 Great Stock for the Next 10 Year"

The Best Performing ETFs of the Bull Market Might Surprise You;3/8/2017;"Eight year ago, the S&P 500 hit it Great Recess close low, and sinc then, equiti around the globe have been soaring. In fact, an S&P 500 invest on March 10th2009 of $10,000 would have been worth over $40,000 today if you had been reinvest dividend (accord to data from Morningstar).But what were the best perform fund in thi time frame? High-fli biotechs? Microcap stock with big growth potential? Actually, among the best perform were value-focus funds. In particular, the most value-centr product of all were the leaders.Pur ValueOf the top ten unleverag ETF sinc the bull market began, three are actual 'pure value' fund from Guggenheim. Guggenheim' entrant in thi market includ the MidCap 400 Pure Valu ETF (RFV) which wa number seven on the list, and then the Small Cap 600 Pure Valu ETF (RZV) in the silver metal spot, and then the S&P 500 Pure Valu ETF (RPV) at number one overall. In fact, RZV and RPV have each turn a $10,000 invest into over $73,000 each sinc the start of the bull market run over the past eight years, crush a 'standard' invest inSPYin the process.A you can see in the chart of the top ten below, thi focu on valu would have also beaten the vast major of ETF in the market. Thi includ the entir world of semiconductor ETF such as SOXX, or ani REIT ETF such as VNQ as well, as these are both absent from the top ten, though they too have beaten the S&P 500 in the time frame.And while mid-cap 'lagged' a bit rel to the absolut apex of the ETF world, the top perform of RPV and RZV did edg out the Internet ETF from PowerShar (PNQI) and First Trust (FDN), and the biotech world with their top entrant of FBT too. So, how did thi pure valu concept manag to outperform against all odds, and over the rest of the valu space as well?What' So Differ About 'Pure'?Th Guggenheim ETF may have been abl to crush their competitor due to their more stringent methodolog which look to avoid overlap between the growth and valu worlds. Thi is what make the funds, accord to Guggenheim at least, 'pure' valu or 'pure' growth choices.Thi is import becaus mani fund in the valu and growth ETF world have signific overlap between the styles, at least for mani providers. By that I mean, a stock that is in the valu fund might also be in the growth fund too.W see thi in SPDR' entrant in the market;SLYVfor valu andSLYGfor growth. Each track a subset of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, and each ha over 330 stock in their funds. In other words, some stock which are in SLYV also find their way into SLYG. Arguably, thi allow less value-ori stock into a portfolio, though it definit promot diversif in the process.Lack of OverlapGuggenheim, on the other hand, restrict stock to either the 'value' or the 'growth' segment for their funds. Thi result in just over 110 stock go into their value-focus S&P 500 fund, and a similar amount for the growth version. And as simpl math will show you, roughli half of the 500 stock do not make it into either growth or valu benchmark at all, leav the Guggenheim fund arguabl more focus on top-notch valu or growth secur as a result.Thi approach seem to be a key differ for the fund compar to other valu ETFs, while the weight method probabl assist in the process too. That is because, for the valu fund, the product will look to weight stock by favor in term of Price/Book ratios, sales/pric ratios, and earnings/pric ratio as well. Still, we should note that Guggenheim isn't the onli one that ha a more focus approach, as some of iShares' product do as well.In fact, the valu ETF that came in second (at least as far as valu ETF alon are concerned) wa the iShar Morningstar Small Cap Valu ETF (JKL) which turn $10,000 to over $55,000 in the eight year bull. Thi fund, along with the Morningstar style box-focus ETF lineup, look at index that put stock into one of three buckets; value, growth, or core. So,overlap isn't an issu here, much like with the Guggenheim lineup.However, Morningstar' index system put a bit more compon into a given style. JKL contain over 240 compani in it basket, and thi is actual pretti compar to what we see with their core fund and their growth fund too. Thi mean that Morningstar look for balanc among the three styles, arguabl (onc again) put a bit lower qualiti valu stock into the basket as a result.So, it appear that at least for thi most recent and current bull run, the more the focu wa on value, the better it wa for investors.Valu Isn't Dead, It Is ThrivingMuch ha been made about the death of valu invest in recent years, but clearli thi approach still hold plenti of promise. And while some growthier segment have done pretti well-such as in the technolog world with the Internet industry' PNQI and FDN, or Biotech' FBT-valu ha been an extrem strong perform over long time frames.So, the next time someon tell you that valu invest doesn't work in today' market, consid the top perform from the bull market run. Sure, some high-fli fund make the list, but these have been larg driven by the stun perform from giant such as Amazon (AMZN) or Pricelin (PCLN).A $10,000 invest in Amazon at the start of the bull market would be worth over $130,000 today, while a $10,000 invest into Pricelin would be worth an astound $220,000 right now. To think that such insan return will happen again to either of these same compani or other larg cap tech stocks, appear to be misguided. Instead, it seem as though a tried-and-tru approach which focus on the absolut best valu stock in the market could be among the best way for investor to profit in the long-term.W key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>All return data from Morningstar, perform is from 3/10/09 - 3/7/17Want the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

E-Commerce Is Killing Traditional Retail;3/7/2017;"E-commerc is rapidli becom the prefer choic of mani consum when it come to shopping, which is begin to threaten the veri exist of tradit brick-and-mortar retail stores. Sinc it emerg in the late 1990s,Amazon(AMZN) ha grown to becom one of the largest retail in the world, onlin or otherwise.With a market capit of more than $400 billion, Amazon is almost twice the size of tradit retail store giantWal-Mart(WMT), which is current valu at around $214 billion. Amazon' growth ha caught the eye of sever tradit retail and a host of onlin entrepreneur who seek to capit on the grow popular of onlin shopping.From giant retail likeMacy's(M),Target(TGT),Kohl's(KSS) andJ.C. Penney(JCP) to special brand such as Truck Dealer Australia, a platform that deal in new and use trucks, as well as Boohoo and Koov (both special in men' and women' attire), everyon believ they can get a piec of the e-commerc cake. In return, mani tradit retail chain have been forc to close sever of their branch in an attempt to cut costs. Macy's, Kohl' and J.C. Penney have been among those that have close sever outlet over the last few years, which ha neg impact their capac to grow revenues.makeArticleAd();A per the chart below, it is pretti clear the revenu of tradit depart store like Macy's, Kohl' and J.C. Penney have stall over the last decade, while their onlin counterpart have continu to gain customers.For instance, Amazon' top line ha continu to soar, climb past the $135 billion mark in the most recent financi year. The compani cross the $100 billion revenu threshold in 2015 and alreadi look set to breach the $160 billion to $170 billion rang in 2017, accord to analyst estimates.Th number of custom buy product in tradit retail store continu to declin as a larg major of consum shift their shop activ to variou onlin platforms. Amazon andeBay(EBAY) have been some of the biggest beneficiari of thi shift. Accord to research done last year by analyt firmcomScore(SCOR) andUPS(UPS), shopper now make 51% of their purchas online, compar to 48% in 2015 and 47% in 2014.The survey will be conduct for the sixth time thi year and those number are expect to be higher base on the current trend. Last year, 5,000 shopper were polled. Of those, 44% of smartphon user claim to have bought item via their devices, compar to 41% in the previou year.Again, thi trend indic that with the increas adopt of mobil shop across the globe, tradit retail could soon be a thing of the past. Even more interest is the fact onlin retail is no longer restrict to small items.Lik in the case of Truck Dealer Australia, there are sever onlin platform shopper can access when look to buy new and use vehicles. Right now, buy a vehicl from Japan can be done with the click of a button or a simpl swipe and tap on a smartphone.In other words, gone are the day of need to take a test drive befor commit to purchas a vehicl due to advanc in onlin shopping. And the competit get tougher when we move to smaller item like cloth and kitchen appliances.Th cultur of onlin shop is gain traction globally, and the U.S. ha been lead the adopt race sinc the late 1990s. Accord to a research studi publish by Pew Research in Decemb of last year, about 80% of all American made at least one purchas online. Thi compar to the research firm' first studi on the same subject back in 2000, which found onli 22% had made an onlin purchase.Now, with 80% of American alreadi have made an onlin purchase, it is onli a matter of time befor the rest of the world catch up. As such, it would be correct to say onlin shop is rapidli take over the retail market.ConclusionIn summary, compani like Kohl' and Macy' have tri to embrac the paradigm shift in consum behavior, but they have yet to achiev the success found by e-commerc stalwart like Amazon. Even Wal-Mart could bare manag a sixth of Amazon' onlin sale in the last financi year.Therefore, the onlin marketplac is becom the mainstay of retail, and thi seem set to render the tradit brick-and-mortar store as a rare altern for onlin shoppers. It will be an interest space to watch for the next few years.Disclosure:I have no posit in ani stock mention in thi article.Start afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Warning!

The downgrad sound bad, but notabl the price target onli drop to $185 from $190. Still, that would repres a declin of roughli 26%.I that type of declin in the cards? With TSLA stock, it' hard to say.Becaus it' one of the market' few ""cult"" stocks, Tesla trade without be tie to valuation. On a valuat basis, it' quit easi to argu that it should go lower. LikeAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN), though, bet against thi stock on valuat alon ha been noth short of a suicid mission.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017In that regard, what' the best way to play Tesla stock?Click to EnlargeSource: StockChartsSo far, it ha found support between $245 and $250, near it 50-day move average. If the stock can maintain thi level of support, it' like to go higher, absent a broader market pullback.Th Bear Case for TSLA StockTechn speaking, TSLA stock look decent near current levels. That said, Goldman' downgrad realli hurt. That tell me there' like some ""weak hands"" still hold the stock that bought in the ralli from $180 to $280 from Decemb until mid-February.Tesla' acquisit of SolarC is also a concern. While have some great products, the solar maker also burn a tremend amount of cash. Consid this: Around the time of the acquisit announcement, Tesla and SolarC were burn roughli the same amount of cash. The difference? Tesla' market cap wa more than10 timesth size of SolarCity.So to say SolarC ha a hole in it pocket is an understatement. Additionally, SolarC quietli cut 20% of it staff at the end of 2016. The cut were pretti much across the board in an effort to preserv cash.That bring capit into the discussion. It' like that Teslawil need to rais capitalin the form of an equiti raise. SolarC add to it needs, but expand it Gigafactori footprint and gear up for Model 3 product will be expens too. TSLA will want to make sure it ha money in the bank.Th Bull Case for TSLA StockTesla stock doe have some posit go for it, too.Initi Model 3 product is slate to begin in July, with volum product set to start in September. Thi can turn into a risk, though, if the compani experi ani significantli delays. Tesla also expect to deliv 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and X unit in the first half of 2017. That' notable, given that the compani onli deliv 76,000 unit in 2016. Hit roughli two-third of that amount in the first half of 2017 show strong momentum. Additionally, Gigafactori expans show that demand is strong.TSLA stock could also benefit from it continu ventur into energy. Tesla' Powerwal product combin with it SolarC unit could creat a nice synergy. It expect to launch it solar roof busi thi fall too.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Notably, Tesla stock ha also benefit from a less-talk about catalyst: infrastructur projects. A new develop ha Tesla act as the backup power sourc for citi with it larg fleet ofrefrigerator-s batteries.

But what we'v seen so far might be a foreshadow of stormi sea ahead.If you'r think about buy SNAP stock, now might be the worst possibl time.Histori Is Not on the Side of SNAP StockTheSnapchat IPOha been one of the biggest and most highli anticip tech IPO in years.

However, within months, both stock had enter a nosedive. Six month after their first day of trading, Facebook wa down 38.4%, and Alibaba wa off 12.8%.Both of these compani are solid compani with strong growth numbers. But their post-IPO weak wasn't surpris -Reuter reportsthat eight of the 10 largest tech IPO in histori deliv neg return of between -25% and -71% in the year follow their first day of trading.Bewar the Lock-Up!On of the major reason whi these IPO typic perform so poorli in their fort year of trade is becaus of the so-cal ""lock-up expiration.""When a compani goe public, the last thing the it want is for insid to immedi cash out by dump million of share into the market. To prevent that dump, share own by insid and major sharehold are typic restrict for a set amount of time.

Thi group includ insid and privat investors.Th second expir is one year after the IPO and appli to 50 million of the 200 million share sold in the IPO.SNAP Stock Might Have Start Out OverpricedTh final reason not to buy SNAP stock is that it may not even be a good invest in the first place.AsTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) investor know all-too-well, popular doe not equal profitability. Sure, Snapchat ha 158 million daili activ user and $404 million in revenu in 2016. But it also report anet loss of $514 million on the year.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesIn fact, within hour of the Snapchat IPO, Pivot Research Group initi coverag of SNAP stock at ""Sell"" and set a $10 price target.

Alexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock … Someday;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continu to roll along. AMZN stock trade just off all-tim high at the moment, have gain over 2,000% over the past 10 years.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil some investor point to the price-to-earn ratio of Amazon stock as a potenti danger sign, I think that viewi short-sighted. The company' legaci busi continu to chang the face of U.S. retailing. Wit the sharp declin thi week atTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which seem directli attribut to Amazon' onlin success.Of course, onlin retail isn't the onli area where AMZN is have success - or where increas profit can drive Amazon stock higher. The company' Amazon Web Servic (AWS) busi ha becom a domin player in cloud.And, of late, the company' Amazon Echo, built on the Alexa Voic Service, ha ad anoth layer to the bull case for AMZN stock.Though I remain bullish on AMZN, I don't think Alexa realli chang the valu of Amazon stock - at least not yet. Amazon is too big and Amazon Echo usag is too spotty, for Alexa and/or Echo to drive impress sale or profit growth on their own.But both product highlight the success of Amazon' long-term strategy; Alexa, in particular, may becom a bigger point of the AMZN stori in the future.Whi Alexa And Echo Aren't A Big Deal For AMZN Stock YetFor ani other company, Echo would be consid a monster hit. Amazon hasn't broken out sale figures, but it did say in Decemb that it had sold""millions""of Echo devices. An outsid firm peg the numberat over 5 million. With the averag sale price for Amazon like around $100 (includ retail markup and sale of lower-pr Amazon Dots), that impli as mucha half a billion dollarsin sale for AMZN.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowThat' a huge number - for anyon but Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN gener more than $135 billion in revenu in 2016, mean Echo-rel sale were like a fraction of 1% of the overal total. Those sale almost certainli come at higher margin for Amazon than, say, ship a book at the company' usual tini markup. But from a profit standpoint, Echo seem like to offer at most a 1%-2% boost, and thu littl impact on the fair valu of AMZN stock at the moment.Meanwhile, the long-term prospect for Echo aren't complet clear. Usagetend to diminish over time(a trend certainli seen in my household). Echo isn't necessarili be use as a shop device, either. Rather, the predomin use are to set a timer, play music, and listen to news summaries.Al told, while I do think there' a strong bull case for AMZN stock, that bull case isn't necessarili predic on Echo. I wouldn't expect that by the end of the decade, consum across America are order Bounti paper towel via drone through Alexa.But that doesn't mean Alexa doesn't matter for Amazon stock.Whi Alexa (In Particular) Could Be A Big Deal For AMZN StockOf course, part of the geniu of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo is that Amazon' move aren't base on the short-term. For all the complaint about AMZN stock' P/E ratio, the compani almost certainli could cut cost substantially, and boost earnings, ani time it wants.But Amazon continu to play the long game. It continu to expand it address markets, take chanc on major successes. (AW remain the most obviou case of how that strategi ha play out well.)From that standpoint, Echo and Alexa are off to a strong earli start.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesAdmittedly, direct Echo revenu are a tini fraction of overal sales, and Echo-direct e-commerc revenu appear small. But Amazon still benefit from both products. For one, Alexa give the compani a toehold in the import artifici intellig (AI) space. It allow Amazon to take onAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri as well asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Googl Home sit in second place at the moment.For Alexa, in particular, the opportun go beyond Echo. Alexa appear in Amazon Tap and the company' Fire Stick. Amazon wise ha open the platform to third-parti developers. They have creat thousand of so-cal ""skills,"" which creat a virtuou cycle. The more skill there are, the more valuabl Alexa is. The more valuabl Alexa becomes, the more skill are created. And the more consum fall in love with the product.Wher Alexa Goe From HereThat open the door to the real potenti valu in Alexa.Alexa isn't about drive e-commerc sale through Echo. It' about creat the domin AI framework in the world. Alexa can be use in automobiles, to allow for safer multi-tasking. There are endless potenti industri applications. Becaus AMZN wise ha open that system, it' far more like to see those applic than Siri or Google' AI.That'sth valu in Alexa: it possibl seem almost endless at the moment. To be sure, that doesn't mean Amazon necessarili will make billion of dollar off Alexa in two years, or in twenty. That' not the point, however. The point is that Amazon.com continu to innovate, and continu to be an ever-increas part of it consumers' daili lives. From there, the argument goes, the busi end will take care of itself, as will AMZN stock.Certainly, it ha work so far.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceiShar Nasdaq Biotechnolog Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchTh 7 Best ETF for Market-B ReturnsTh postAlexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc.

Better Buy: Costco Wholesale Corporation vs. Wal-Mart;3/7/2017;"Costco Wholesal Corporation(NASDAQ: COST) andWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) have come to domin U.S. retail. While that size is a testament to the company' histor success, late it hasn't been much of advantage. Shop habit are shift as more peopl buy online, andAmazon.comha been rapidli outgrow Costco and Wal-Mart lately, and even surpass Costco in revenu last year.Confront with the threat of e-commerce, Costco and Wal-Mart have chosen differ strategies. Costco ha larg doubl down on the warehouse/membership model, open new store and resist omni-channel servic that have becom common at other retailers, and the compani just announc it would rais it membership fee thi year. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, ha transform it strategy, acquir Jet.com to get a jump-start in e-commerc and slow down new store open to invest instead in e-commerce, higher wage and better training, and improv it current store base.Let' take a closer look at these two retail behemoth to see which is the better buy today.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Motley Fool.Th warehous kingpinCostco share sold off follow the company' recent earn report as it miss estim on all accounts. The warehous retail post a respect compar sale increas of 3%, but earn per share actual shrunk from $1.24 to $1.17 as merchandis cost rose 6%, wipe out a similar increas in sales.Th sell-off show how Costco' premium valuat make it vulner in a way that peer aren't. The warehous chain ha fare better than competitor recent as compar sale continu to tick higher, but there have been pocket of weakness. Sale growth ha slowed, and sale per squar foot, a measur of how effici it' use it real estate, declin last year.Th compani ha resist ramp up e-commerc operations, with CFO Richard Galanti tell investor last year that it would not implement a buy online-pick up in-stor program becaus the company' goal wa to bring custom into the store. Costco' ""treasur hunt"" model mean the compani often get increment sale from custom walk through the stores.Whil other retail are shutter store or hold back on growth, Costco ha maintain it growth pace. The compani ha open 13 warehous through the first half of the year, and look set to match last year' total of 32 for the full year, grow it store footprint by 4%. If sale per squar foot continu to fall and same-stor sale keep moderating, that strategi could becom a problem.Imag source: Wal-MartA whole new Wal-MartIn recent years, Costco ha skate rel unscath past the industri challenges, but the same hasn't been true for Wal-Mart. A few years, the retail giant wa see same-stor sale fall, and the chain often rank at the bottom of custom satisfact surveys. CEO Doug McMillion ha sought to right those wrong by rais wages, revamp employe training, invest to clean up and spruce up stores, and build out the company' e-commerc business.A a result of those efforts, the compani ha now seen nine straight quarter of increas compar sales, reach a peak of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. E-commerc sale growth ha also recov with the help of the Jet.com acquisit as onlin sale growth reach 29% in the recent quarter, up from singl digit earlier in the year.However, all those invest have cost the compani on the bottom line. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart' oper incom fell 5.6% to $22.8 billion, and adjust EP fell 6% from $4.59 to $4.32. The compani expect earn to be flat thi year, forecast EP of $4.20-$4.40. For fiscal 2019, Wal-Mart expect earn to grow 5%. In other words, Wal-Mart investor will have to be patient with the company' new strategy.And the winner of the retail showdown isBoth retail find themselv in challeng posit today as shop pattern shift. Costco ha the better momentum of the two as it stock ha outperform Wal-Mart in pretti much everi timefram over the last decade, but investor are pay up for it shares. They current carri a P/E valuat of 32, pricier than almost ani other big retailer. Wal-Mart trade at a valuat of just half of that at 16, and offer the better dividend yield at 2.9% versu just 1% for Costco.Whil I'd be cautiou with either one of these stock given the challeng retail environ today, Wal-Mart look like the better pick of the two. The compani is aggress shift strategi to compet with Amazon and grow it business, and it' also cheaper and pay a better dividend. Costco shares, meanwhile, could slide if sale growth continu to decline.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The downgrad sound bad, but notabl the price target onli drop to $185 from $190. Still, that would repres a declin of roughli 26%.I that type of declin in the cards? With TSLA stock, it' hard to say.Becaus it' one of the market' few ""cult"" stocks, Tesla trade without be tie to valuation. On a valuat basis, it' quit easi to argu that it should go lower. LikeAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN), though, bet against thi stock on valuat alon ha been noth short of a suicid mission.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017In that regard, what' the best way to play Tesla stock?Click to EnlargeSource: StockChartsSo far, it ha found support between $245 and $250, near it 50-day move average. If the stock can maintain thi level of support, it' like to go higher, absent a broader market pullback.Th Bear Case for TSLA StockTechn speaking, TSLA stock look decent near current levels. That said, Goldman' downgrad realli hurt. That tell me there' like some ""weak hands"" still hold the stock that bought in the ralli from $180 to $280 from Decemb until mid-February.Tesla' acquisit of SolarC is also a concern. While have some great products, the solar maker also burn a tremend amount of cash. Consid this: Around the time of the acquisit announcement, Tesla and SolarC were burn roughli the same amount of cash. The difference? Tesla' market cap wa more than10 timesth size of SolarCity.So to say SolarC ha a hole in it pocket is an understatement. Additionally, SolarC quietli cut 20% of it staff at the end of 2016. The cut were pretti much across the board in an effort to preserv cash.That bring capit into the discussion. It' like that Teslawil need to rais capitalin the form of an equiti raise. SolarC add to it needs, but expand it Gigafactori footprint and gear up for Model 3 product will be expens too. TSLA will want to make sure it ha money in the bank.Th Bull Case for TSLA StockTesla stock doe have some posit go for it, too.Initi Model 3 product is slate to begin in July, with volum product set to start in September. Thi can turn into a risk, though, if the compani experi ani significantli delays. Tesla also expect to deliv 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and X unit in the first half of 2017. That' notable, given that the compani onli deliv 76,000 unit in 2016. Hit roughli two-third of that amount in the first half of 2017 show strong momentum. Additionally, Gigafactori expans show that demand is strong.TSLA stock could also benefit from it continu ventur into energy. Tesla' Powerwal product combin with it SolarC unit could creat a nice synergy. It expect to launch it solar roof busi thi fall too.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Notably, Tesla stock ha also benefit from a less-talk about catalyst: infrastructur projects. A new develop ha Tesla act as the backup power sourc for citi with it larg fleet ofrefrigerator-s batteries. Thi could pave the way to more consist sale and earn to buoy the ups-and-down of Tesla' other businesses.Th Bottom Line for TeslaTher are a ton of posit go for TSLA stock right now. With that said, Tesla ha been known to over-promis and under-deliver. It' quit possibl (and almost likely) that it won't be abl to execut with acut precis on each business.Th loss of it CFO make it more like that Tesla will miss the mark, financi speaking. Add in a money-los busi like SolarC make both business- and financial-execut even more difficult.Tack on a potenti capit raise, and TSLA stock could be ripe for more downside.Do I think a 26% declin is in the cards? I'm not bet that way, unless a broader market correct materializes.

However, within months, both stock had enter a nosedive. Six month after their first day of trading, Facebook wa down 38.4%, and Alibaba wa off 12.8%.Both of these compani are solid compani with strong growth numbers. But their post-IPO weak wasn't surpris -Reuter reportsthat eight of the 10 largest tech IPO in histori deliv neg return of between -25% and -71% in the year follow their first day of trading.Bewar the Lock-Up!On of the major reason whi these IPO typic perform so poorli in their fort year of trade is becaus of the so-cal ""lock-up expiration.""When a compani goe public, the last thing the it want is for insid to immedi cash out by dump million of share into the market. To prevent that dump, share own by insid and major sharehold are typic restrict for a set amount of time.

But Silicon Valley compani like Snap Inc have rel young insid and investors. Peopl in their 20 or 30 may find it imposs to resist the temptat to becom instant millionaires.SNAP actual ha two differ lock-up expir dates:Th first date is 150 day (five months) after the offer for all of the pre-IPO investors. Thi group includ insid and privat investors.Th second expir is one year after the IPO and appli to 50 million of the 200 million share sold in the IPO.SNAP Stock Might Have Start Out OverpricedTh final reason not to buy SNAP stock is that it may not even be a good invest in the first place.AsTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) investor know all-too-well, popular doe not equal profitability. Sure, Snapchat ha 158 million daili activ user and $404 million in revenu in 2016. But it also report anet loss of $514 million on the year.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesIn fact, within hour of the Snapchat IPO, Pivot Research Group initi coverag of SNAP stock at ""Sell"" and set a $10 price target. That target repres roughli 60% downsid from Snapchat' Day 1 close price.""I could gener $1 billion in revenu if you gave me $2 billion today,"" analystBrian Wiesersaid of Snapchat' financ thu far.

Alexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock … Someday;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continu to roll along. AMZN stock trade just off all-tim high at the moment, have gain over 2,000% over the past 10 years.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil some investor point to the price-to-earn ratio of Amazon stock as a potenti danger sign, I think that viewi short-sighted. The company' legaci busi continu to chang the face of U.S. retailing. Wit the sharp declin thi week atTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which seem directli attribut to Amazon' onlin success.Of course, onlin retail isn't the onli area where AMZN is have success - or where increas profit can drive Amazon stock higher. The company' Amazon Web Servic (AWS) busi ha becom a domin player in cloud.And, of late, the company' Amazon Echo, built on the Alexa Voic Service, ha ad anoth layer to the bull case for AMZN stock.Though I remain bullish on AMZN, I don't think Alexa realli chang the valu of Amazon stock - at least not yet. Amazon is too big and Amazon Echo usag is too spotty, for Alexa and/or Echo to drive impress sale or profit growth on their own.But both product highlight the success of Amazon' long-term strategy; Alexa, in particular, may becom a bigger point of the AMZN stori in the future.Whi Alexa And Echo Aren't A Big Deal For AMZN Stock YetFor ani other company, Echo would be consid a monster hit. Amazon hasn't broken out sale figures, but it did say in Decemb that it had sold""millions""of Echo devices. An outsid firm peg the numberat over 5 million. With the averag sale price for Amazon like around $100 (includ retail markup and sale of lower-pr Amazon Dots), that impli as mucha half a billion dollarsin sale for AMZN.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowThat' a huge number - for anyon but Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN gener more than $135 billion in revenu in 2016, mean Echo-rel sale were like a fraction of 1% of the overal total. Those sale almost certainli come at higher margin for Amazon than, say, ship a book at the company' usual tini markup. But from a profit standpoint, Echo seem like to offer at most a 1%-2% boost, and thu littl impact on the fair valu of AMZN stock at the moment.Meanwhile, the long-term prospect for Echo aren't complet clear. Usagetend to diminish over time(a trend certainli seen in my household). Echo isn't necessarili be use as a shop device, either. Rather, the predomin use are to set a timer, play music, and listen to news summaries.Al told, while I do think there' a strong bull case for AMZN stock, that bull case isn't necessarili predic on Echo. I wouldn't expect that by the end of the decade, consum across America are order Bounti paper towel via drone through Alexa.But that doesn't mean Alexa doesn't matter for Amazon stock.Whi Alexa (In Particular) Could Be A Big Deal For AMZN StockOf course, part of the geniu of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo is that Amazon' move aren't base on the short-term. For all the complaint about AMZN stock' P/E ratio, the compani almost certainli could cut cost substantially, and boost earnings, ani time it wants.But Amazon continu to play the long game. It continu to expand it address markets, take chanc on major successes. (AW remain the most obviou case of how that strategi ha play out well.)From that standpoint, Echo and Alexa are off to a strong earli start.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesAdmittedly, direct Echo revenu are a tini fraction of overal sales, and Echo-direct e-commerc revenu appear small. But Amazon still benefit from both products. For one, Alexa give the compani a toehold in the import artifici intellig (AI) space. It allow Amazon to take onAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri as well asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Googl Home sit in second place at the moment.For Alexa, in particular, the opportun go beyond Echo. Alexa appear in Amazon Tap and the company' Fire Stick. Amazon wise ha open the platform to third-parti developers. They have creat thousand of so-cal ""skills,"" which creat a virtuou cycle. The more skill there are, the more valuabl Alexa is. The more valuabl Alexa becomes, the more skill are created. And the more consum fall in love with the product.Wher Alexa Goe From HereThat open the door to the real potenti valu in Alexa.Alexa isn't about drive e-commerc sale through Echo. It' about creat the domin AI framework in the world. Alexa can be use in automobiles, to allow for safer multi-tasking. There are endless potenti industri applications. Becaus AMZN wise ha open that system, it' far more like to see those applic than Siri or Google' AI.That'sth valu in Alexa: it possibl seem almost endless at the moment. To be sure, that doesn't mean Amazon necessarili will make billion of dollar off Alexa in two years, or in twenty. That' not the point, however. The point is that Amazon.com continu to innovate, and continu to be an ever-increas part of it consumers' daili lives. From there, the argument goes, the busi end will take care of itself, as will AMZN stock.Certainly, it ha work so far.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceiShar Nasdaq Biotechnolog Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchTh 7 Best ETF for Market-B ReturnsTh postAlexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc.

The compani ha open 13 warehous through the first half of the year, and look set to match last year' total of 32 for the full year, grow it store footprint by 4%. If sale per squar foot continu to fall and same-stor sale keep moderating, that strategi could becom a problem.Imag source: Wal-MartA whole new Wal-MartIn recent years, Costco ha skate rel unscath past the industri challenges, but the same hasn't been true for Wal-Mart. A few years, the retail giant wa see same-stor sale fall, and the chain often rank at the bottom of custom satisfact surveys. CEO Doug McMillion ha sought to right those wrong by rais wages, revamp employe training, invest to clean up and spruce up stores, and build out the company' e-commerc business.A a result of those efforts, the compani ha now seen nine straight quarter of increas compar sales, reach a peak of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. E-commerc sale growth ha also recov with the help of the Jet.com acquisit as onlin sale growth reach 29% in the recent quarter, up from singl digit earlier in the year.However, all those invest have cost the compani on the bottom line. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart' oper incom fell 5.6% to $22.8 billion, and adjust EP fell 6% from $4.59 to $4.32. The compani expect earn to be flat thi year, forecast EP of $4.20-$4.40. For fiscal 2019, Wal-Mart expect earn to grow 5%. In other words, Wal-Mart investor will have to be patient with the company' new strategy.And the winner of the retail showdown isBoth retail find themselv in challeng posit today as shop pattern shift. Costco ha the better momentum of the two as it stock ha outperform Wal-Mart in pretti much everi timefram over the last decade, but investor are pay up for it shares. They current carri a P/E valuat of 32, pricier than almost ani other big retailer. Wal-Mart trade at a valuat of just half of that at 16, and offer the better dividend yield at 2.9% versu just 1% for Costco.Whil I'd be cautiou with either one of these stock given the challeng retail environ today, Wal-Mart look like the better pick of the two. The compani is aggress shift strategi to compet with Amazon and grow it business, and it' also cheaper and pay a better dividend. Costco shares, meanwhile, could slide if sale growth continu to decline.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloud;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) founder and Execut Chairman Jack Ma ha a lot of iron in the fire; nowher is that truer than in hi fight to take onAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the global race for enterpris cloud comput dominance. Right now, it' not even close - Amazon is lead by a countri mile, but BABA is quickli close the gap between the two and that' a good thing if you own Alibaba stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazonenteredth cloud comput busi in 2006. Amazon Web Servic (AWS) now gener more than $3.1 billion in oper incom (fiscal 2016) from $12.2 billion in revenue, a juici oper margin of 25.4%.Thi wa consider higher than the $1.1 billion it gener from $123.8 billion (0.90% oper margin) in revenu from it e-commerc and Amazon Prime membership fees.It' easi to understand whi BABA want in on Amazon' action - there' lot of money to be made from the cloud.What' Go on With Alibaba Stock and the Cloud?In Q3 2016, Alibaba went over the $1 billion annual run rate in cloud comput revenu gener $254 million from 765,000 pay customers, up 115% and 100% year-over-year respectively. Most importantly, it cloud comput busi had an oper loss of just $49 million, 18.3% less than it Q2 2016 oper loss of$60 million.That' great news for Alibaba stock becaus at thi rate, it should be in the black by sometim in fiscal 2017 and that will add to the alreadi signific oper profit it gener from it core e-commerc busi -$4 billionin the third quarter alone, a mouth-wat oper margin of 59.7%.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017Put anoth way, BABA' cloud comput segment along with it other money-los busi lost $976 million in the third quarter on revenu of $961 million; essentially, it lost a dollar for everi dollar of revenue.That' insane.Alibaba generated$5.5 billionin oper profit through the first nine month of fiscal 2016 despit loss in other area total $2.8 billion. Amazon gener $4.2 billion in oper incom from more than 10 time the revenue.Ther are mani reason whi you might want to own Amazon' stock (Jeff Bezosi a big one) but consid how valuabl BABA stock would be were it cloud comput busi gener oper profit margin similar to AWS.Alibaba' cloud comput busi would go from an annual loss of $225 million ($169 million oper loss in Q3 2016 on an annual basis) on $1 billion in revenu to an oper profit of $250 million on the same revenue, a $475 million difference.""Our goal is to overtak Amazon in four years, whether that' in customers, technology, or worldwid scale,"" Simon Hu, the head of Alibaba' cloud businesstoldReutersin 2015. ""Amazon, Microsoft and other have alreadi laid the groundwork for us by educ the market about cloud in the U.S. and Europe, so we have an even better opportun to join in the competition.""Estim put the global cloud comput busi at $20 billion. However, given Amazon' AW revenu in 2016 wa $12.2 billion,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is come on in thi area and thought to be in thesecondspot behind AMZN and Alibaba' annual run rate is over $1 billion, the number is like much higher.Whi Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Could Have More Problem Than You ThinkAccord to TechCrunch, Synergi Research Group analyst John Dinsdal reveal that ""For cloud infrastructur servic (IaaS, PaaS, Host Privat Cloud services) Alibaba is now rank sixth, base on worldwid revenu in Q4. For China specifically, while AW and Microsoft are in the top five rank in China, the market is led by Alibaba (a long way out in front) follow by China Telecom. Alibaba market share is run at 40 percent [in China] and ha been increas with time.""Bottom Line on BABA StockInterestingly, the fact that BABA stock wa late to the cloud comput party, might actual work in it favor becaus larg compani are far more open to work in the cloud these day than they were a decad ago when Amazon got in the business.Therefore, you could argu that the company' invest in the cloud, albeit sever billion dollars, is still far less riski than Amazon' initi move back in 2006.While there are mani tentacl to the Alibaba stock, cloud comput is one that will continu to reap dividend for BABA stock in the year to come.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Telecom Stock That Are High-Yield Money Traps5 Blue-Chip Stock to Buy in MarchTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloudappear first onInvestorPlace."

Blue Origin Boss Jeff Bezos Lays Out His Plan for Space;3/6/2017;"""It' time for America to go back to the Moon, and thi time to stay. We can do it. It' a difficult but worthi objective.""-- Amazon.com founder, Blue Origin owner, andTheWashington Postsavior Jeff BezosAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezo is on a win streak.makeArticleAd();Shar of the internet retail that Bezo found are up more than 70% off their low of last February. At the same time, Bezos' pioneer space launch company, Blue Origin, is also do well. Last June, Blue Origin and Bezo won the prestigiousHeinlein Prizefor ""progress in commerci space activ that advanc [the] dream of humanity' futur in space."" Last week, Bezo pick up anoth award, thi time fromAvi Week, which declar Blue Origin it 60th Annual Space Laureate.At the accept dinner for the latter award, Bezo let slip some surpris revelations. In the space of less than 15 minutes, he laid out forAviationaficionado hi latest plan for space explor -- and I'll bet a lot of what he had to say will surpris you. Here are a few of the highlights.Jeff Bezo dream of packag deliveri to space. Imag source: Blue Origin.Human return to spaceIn the nearest term, Blue Origin' New Shepard suborbit rocket, power by the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen BE-3 engin that it built in-house, is prepar to carri human tourist to the edg of space. Flight safeti test are ongoing, and if the compani hold true to it plans, pay passeng could begin visit space aboard New Shepard as soon as next year.Last year, Blue Origin broke ground on amass new rocket factoryin Florida, which will build the rocket to take them there....and to the MoonBut Earth orbit is just the beginning. In an ""exclusive"" report the day of theAviat Weekaward,Th Washington Post(also own by Bezos) report that Bezo want to creat an ""Amazon-lik shipment servic for the moon that would deliv gear for experiments, cargo and habitat by mid-2020.""Bezo expand on the idea at the award dinner, say Blue Origin want to ""partner with NASA"" on thi service, with an eye to eventu establish a perman human settlement on the Moon. A white paper on the subject (review by thePost) confirm that thi is not an idea that origin at NASA, but rather a project Blue Origin is urg NASA to adopt -- and offer to help out with, and help fund, if NASA is amenable.Get to the Moon could be done with Blue Origin' New Glenn rocket, now under development. Alternatively, say Bezos, ""our architectur can fli on top of SLS"" thatBoeing(NYSE: BA) andLockhe Martin(NYSE: LMT) are build for NASA, ""or it can fli on top of the [smaller] Atla 551 and deliv a more modest payload to the surfac of the Moon.""Eith way, Blue Origin believ it can have a ""Blue Moon"" lander (base on New Shepard' vertical-land technology) readi and abl to begin moon land as earli as Juli 2020.Incidentally, Bezo argu that such a lunar settlement is a necessari precursor to the man Mar mission that NASA is plan to conductcirca 2034: ""I think that if you go to the Moon first and make the Moon your home, then you can get to Mar more easily.""Beyond 2020And what come after that? Like hi competitor Elon Musk at SpaceX, Bezo believ thatreusability""i a key"" to commerci space. As Bezo explains, ""The reason that Amazon ha succeed is ... becaus so mani thousand of start-up compani can participate. That' becaus the cost of [particip in the internet economy] is veri low."" But now, Bezo want to use Blue Origin to do to space explor what he' alreadi done to packag deliveri with Amazon.Th troubl with space travel, Bezo explains, is that ""the cost of admiss ... is quit high.... So veri few experi get done."" The cost of the fuel need to reach orbit (or even the Moon) is ""trivial small,"" say Bezo -- about $0.10 per pound, or a few hundr thousand dollar per launch. The real reason space is so expensive, therefore, is that the spacecraft that burn the fuel is an expens piec of hardwar that' thrown away after everi mission.Lik Musk at SpaceX, Bezo believ that develop reusabl spacecraft that can launch and land -- on Earth, on the Moon, or elsewher -- will permit compani to cut out the cost of expend spacecraft, and pay mainli for the ""trivial"" cost of fuel when travel to space. Thi will lower the cost of space launches, and permitmor start-up companiesto launch cheaper things, and experi with space travel.Mad in spaceAnd Bezo believ thi is essential. Lay out the math, he suggest one take the current energi usag on Earth, and grow it just a few percentag point per year to account for popul growth and rise standard of living. In just a few hundr years, say Bezos, the entir land surfac of the Earth will need to be cover in solar panel to meet our energi needs.Becaus thi is obvious impractical, Bezo believ that energy-intens manufactur will ultim need to be conduct in space, where resourc are abund and solar power is avail 24/7, with no cloud or weather to muck up the process. (NASA may agree. Already, it' cooper with Made in Space to prototyp and test system for addit manufactur -- aka 3D print -- in orbit, includingaboard the Intern Space Station.)Fifty-plu year from now, say Bezos, Earth will be ""zone residenti and light industrial,"" and essenti all of our heavi manufactur will be done in space.Bezo believ thi so-cal ""Great Inversion"" is the futur for Mankind. And with New Shepard, New Glenn, and soon Blue Moon, he' help to make it so.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

3 High-Yield Stocks of 14%-Plus: Are They Safe?;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsEveri now and then, I like to scan the absolut highest of the high-yield stock to see if there is some undiscov stori hidden away. Most investor know, at thi point, that high-yield stock can be great things. However, a yield that istoohigh should rais suspicion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh danger of a high yield that is, in fact, too high is that it may suggest the stock price ha fallen danger low for a reason. Super-high-yield stock whose price have fallen precipit becaus of some major problem within the compani may herald that the yield is go to be cut back. The compani may have liquid problems.But I look for these super-high-yield stock to see if perhap there is a valu play in the mix - if the market ha unfairli punish a stock or doesn't see someth I do.3 Closed-End Fund With Sky-High Yield of 10% or MoreSo here' a look at the three stock with the highest dividend yield to see if they are safe to invest in. Note that I exclud royalti trust and ship compani as these have special circumst as securities.High-Yield Stocks: Stage Store Inc (SSI)Stag Store Inc(NYSE:SSI) is a compani I'v never heard of, despit it have over 800 store across 39 states. It ha a direct-to-consum busi also, that oper under the brand name of Bealls, Goody's, Palai Royal and Peebl (a well as Stage). As I write, SSI stock trade at $2.13 and pay 60 cent per share annually, amount to an incred dividend yield of 28.1%.Right away, I'm nervou becaus I don't invest in retail stores. Consum are too fickle, and just about anyth can be purchas atAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). That be said, we have to stay object and look at whi thi is at the top of the high-yield stock list.In earli January, SSIreporteda 7.3% declin in same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and revis Q4 EP down to 20 cent to 35 cent from 60 cent to 95 cents. It also expect a loss of 70 cent to 85 cent for the year. So SSI is lose money, about $25 million thi fiscal year, which not a good sign.That' not necessarili a critic bad thing, if the compani had posit free cash flow and lot of cash. But it doesn't.Trailing-12-month FCF is about $10 million. The compani pay out about $17 million annual in dividends. SSI onli had $19 million in cash from it last quarter.I don't see thi dividend as sustainable. It will be cut or even eliminated. I will say that one good quarter could creat a buy spree in the stock, so aggress specul may find a bottom fisher here.High-Yield Stocks: New York Mortgag Trust (NYMT)New York Mortgag Trust Inc(NASDAQ:NYMT) is an mREIT that invest in residenti mortgage-back securities, multifamili commerci mortgage-back securities, and residenti mortgag loans. NYMT trade at $6.37 and pay 96-cent-per-shar per year, for an annual yield of 15.1%.Right away, I see news I don't like. First,NYMTdid a capit raise, but the bond were issu at 96% of par AND pay 6.25%. Not onli that, after back out the expens associ with the bond issue, NYMT onli get about 92% of the total issu amount. In other words, thi is a realli expens way to rais money, and if that' the best NYMT can do, then whi is it pay such a high yield?Worse, thi is a convert bond, mean investor can convert it into equiti at about $7 per share. That could result in sudden dilution.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowAl thi tell me is that NYMT is tri to hold on to the idea of pay thi high yield through a veri expens capit raise.High-Yield Stock to Consider: TICC Capit Corp. (TICC)TICC Capit Corp.(NASDAQ:TICC) is a Busi Develop Company. These vehicl rais money, usual through low-cost debt, and then loan that money to compani experienc growth, but which can't get tradit bank financing. The loan tend to yield in the 9%-14% range, thu make BDC potenti good place to find high-yield investments. They lend their money out at significantli higher rate than their cost of capital.TICCtrad at $7.32 and pay $1.16 per share, for a dividend yield of 15.9%, make it one of the top high-yield stock in the market.Th problem with TICC is that the credit market are get veri overheated. So, go back to thi idea of get low-cost debt, those cost are rising. They are usual peg to LIBOR, and that benchmark is rising. TICC fund it last quarter' dividend with 11 cent from net interest income, but the rest wa return of capital.That' not alway a bad sign, but in thi case, coupl with how TICC gener it income, it' not good at all. I think we have a dividend cut coming, and I don't like that the credit spread that TICC reli upon are contracting.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

Can $7 Billion Turn Things Around for Target?;3/6/2017;"Target(NYSE: TGT) bought someth extrem valuabl last week when it releas it outlook for 2017. It bought time. Three years, to be specific. The cost came directli out of the pocket of investors, though, and Target' stock plung 12% follow the company' fourth-quart earn report.Target told investor it' head into a year of investment, and it won't return to profit growth until 2019. If that sound familiar, it' becauseWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) told a similar stori to investor in 2015. Share of Wal-Mart face a similar double-digit percentage-point drop when it announc it plans.Target plan to spend $7 billion to remodel stores, expand it small-stor format, drive onlin sale growth, and lower it price to compet with Wal-Mart andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Overall, it expect the invest to cost the compani $1 billion in oper profit thi year. While Target ha no pressur to grow profit in the short term, will it invest pay off in the long run?makeArticleAd();Imag source: TargetRevers it origin planWhil Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar retail lower price to compet with Amazon.com, Target rais price the past few years. In fact, Target' sale declin over the past few year would have been much wors if Target hadn't focus on higher-priced, higher-margin products.But now it' revers direction, and it' hope to drive greater foot traffic with lower gross margin. Target will work to lower price over the next three year to compet with the price of Wal-Mart (which recent made it own effort to lower price even more) and Amazon. ""We are aggress invest in the busi to make sure we are highli competit on price across our assortment,"" CEO Brian Cornel told investors.In an effort to drive higher foot traffic, it' also remodel stores. It expect to remodel 600 store by 2019, and each remodel will cost around $5.5 million, accord to management. Target also plan to open 100 new smaller format store in citi and on colleg campuses.Whil Target' remodel should help drive same-store-sal growth into posit territori again, those sale will come at a lower gross margin. It' hard to see how Target' bottom line benefit from all thi new spending, even in the long run.Tak on the onlin competitionOn bright spot at Target is the growth of it digit sales. Digit sale increas 34% in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the growth ofWal-Mart or Amazon.But Target is grow off a much smaller base than it compet retailers. Digit sale amount to just $3.4 billion last year for Target.Bi comparison, Amazon sold $124 billion worth of stuff onlin in 2016.Target plan to compet by revamp it suppli chain and use stockroom at it store to ship directli to customers. With 1,800 store in the U.S., that make it extrem competit with Amazon. Amazon onli ha a few dozen fulfil centers, but they'r veri strateg located, as 44% of the U.S. popul live within 20 mile of an Amazon fulfil center.Wal-Mart is work on someth similar and recent start offer free two-day ship on about 2 million product sold online. Of course, that pale in comparison with the select of Prime-elig product on Amazon.But Target again suffer from the same conundrum as Wal-Mart when it come to attract more onlin sales. Amazon is at the top of people' mind when they think of onlin shopping. Overcom that hurdl is much more import than improv fulfil speed at thi point.Target' plan to spend $7 billion over the next three year are bold, and given the current trend of sale declines, the compani could use some shake up. It' certainli feel some pain in the short term as it reset expectations. It' unclear, though, if it plan to invigor long-term growth will actual pay off.

If a stock turn out to be a valu trap, it can take year befor you realiz you have fallen down the hole and, by thi time, what wa initi a small invest may have becom substantial.Tri to avoid valu trap is a key part of valu investing, but you will not be abl to avoid all of them. There is no set approach to avoid traps, you can onli tri to avoid those compani with all the hallmarks.On of the key hallmark of valu trap is the overal natur of the industri they oper within. Is the industri suffer a broader cyclic declin or is the declin structural?A cyclic declin is just part of the natur busi process and present an attract entri point for investors. On the other hand, if the industri is suffer a structur decline, you could run into bigger problems. It is arguabl that the U.S. brick-and-mortar retail industri is suffer a structur decline. While overal retail sale are expanding, mani retail are report declin sale in tradit store as cost creep up. Onlin retail such asAmazon(AMZN), which have a much lower cost base and bigger distribut network, are domin the market. The price advantag these competitor have over tradit brick-and-mortar peer mean they can cut cost to level where other cannot compete. It is clear thi is not a cyclic problem, it is a structur issu that is affect the entir U.S. retail industry.Not helpingRetail themselv are not help the situation. Mani retail have now enter somewhat of a death spiral where they are tri to cut cost by close stores, but are damag their appeal with customers, physic presenc and footprint by do so.Closur will lead to more closures, which will lead to more closur as the store becom less and less relevant. Do they have a choice? Not really. Few compani can carri on with declin sale forev without reduc the cost base. The differ with retail is they need a larg presenc in order to keep their appeal with customers. The one thing shop onlin will never be abl to recreat is the experi of wander a mall or brows a store. Retail are kill their onli advantag by close their physic presence.Not cheap enoughConsid all of the above, even if you have a posit outlook on the sector, it is pretti hard to justifi buy U.S. retail as a valu investment.A Benjamin Graham said, however, there are no bad assets, just bad prices, which is correct even in thi case. U.S. retail may becom a valu play, but onli when everyon els ha given up on the sector. When store cut have gone as far as they can and retailers' sale declin start to slow, the industri may becom attract again. But for the time being, it look as if onlin retail will continu to rule the market, especi with new minimum wage rule come into effect. These rule will onli make the sector more uncompetitive. The onli advantag brick-and-mortar retail have over onlin competitor is the physic shop experience. They need to learn to util thi uniqu sell point befor sale declin cannot be reversed.Overall, U.S. retail may becom a contrarian valu play, but the sector' structur declin are still too sever for the time being.Disclosure:Th author own no stock mentioned.Start afre 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.FRGI 15-Year Financi DataTh intrins valu of FRGIPet Lynch Chart of FRGIPremium MembersThi articl first appear onGuruFocus."

It' difficult to fathom such a high valuat for a compani that ship just 76,000 vehicl last year and burn through anoth $448 million in cash in Q4.The market may have higher hope for Tesla stock than ani other stock on the market. But long-term TSLA bull don't care about Q4, or even 2017 for that matter. They aren't just invest in an auto company.

Hi masteri of the stock market (the S&P 500 trail Contrafund with an averag annual 10.17%) ha attract a mountain of investor assets, make Contra Fidelity' largest activ manag fund and the third-largest activ run industrywide.makeArticleAd();And Danoff and Contra are at it again thi year, prove onc again that a big fund can outmaneuv more-nimbl smaller funds. The fund' 9.61% gain through March 3 top the S&P 500 as well as hi peer' average.In a recent convers with IBD, Danoff, 56, talk about the scienc of investing, lesson to be learn from the New England Patriot Super Bowl champ and invest opportun he see in the Trump era. And, oh yeah, Danoff went over what he like about sever of hi recent top holdings, includingBroadcom(AVGO),Netflix(NFLX) andAmazon(AMZN).IBD:You'r a Boston guy, Will. What did you think about the Super Bowl?Danoff:For me, sport is a lot like business. You know, how to build a team. How to find all-stars, who can put the ball in the end zone. There wa a lot of psycholog at work in that game. And it show the import of preparation.What the Patriot taught us is to keep look forward. They don't dwell on their mistakes. And they made a fair number of mistak in that game. (They were trail 28-3 in the final minut of the third quarter.) The lesson for investor is, they stay focus on their goals.IBD:How is a game like invest in stocks?Danoff:Th stock market is a veri emot beast. You get knock over. But the import thing is to stand back up. Over and over, you tri to do better. And the opportun come. You just have to prepar for them.IBD:Will, for peopl who may not be familiar with the fund and are confus by it name - doe it invest in weird stocks?Danoff:No, Contrafund is a capit appreci fund with a growth bias. I think over time stock price follow earn per share. If a compani can doubl it earn over the next five years, most like the stock will doubl it share price, plu or minu a little.IBD:Summar what you look for in stocks.Danoff:I'm look for compani that are well-posit in their industry, run by experienc manag team who are enthusiast about what they do, are honor peopl who accept that industri as cyclical, so they make prudent capit alloc decisions.I'v also found that invest with manag that ha a larg ownership stake and therefor are on the same side of the tabl as sharehold is a good thing to do.IBD:How ha experi made you fine-tun your invest approach?Danoff:I'v seen over and over, you have to be careful. I have over time becom more disciplin and sensit to what I'm pay for earn growth.There' no reward for degre of difficulti in investing. You don't have to be the first investor to find a good story. You can be cautious. If a stock ha alreadi doubl or tripled, it doesn't mean you'v miss it. If it' go to doubl or tripl again, it' probabl still a buy. It' like sport matches. Who care what happen on the last point scored? You'r play thi point now.IBD:Let' talk stocks. In each case, I'm ask about your thesi as of your latest disclosure.HealthEquity(HQY) (which is up 7% so far thi year) run platform where consum can access tax-advantag health care save and check treatment options. You open your stake in Novemb and boost it in December. Whi the interest?Danoff:Influenc by (IBD founder) Bill O'Neil and others, I'v been intrigu by opportun in new compani to the market. Fidel creat a new global fund (Fidel Insight Class) for Canadian investors, launch in the past few weeks, that let' me cast a wider net for small- and midcap companies.IBD:So you learn about HealthEqu while do research for the Canadian fund?Danoff:Right. I ask analyst on that fund to bring small and midcap idea becaus the new fund allow me to take smaller positions. HealthEqu is a provid of health save account (HSAs), which is a grow sector in human resources. Compani that are grow 40% a year are attractive. The whole health care system is move toward more consum participation, which can help control health care costs. Peopl went to a doctor, onli paid a $5 or $10 copay, so they didn't hesit to ask about everi littl ache. That' financi unsustainable. HSA are part of the solution.IBD:Your long-term outperform is notable, but 2016 wa an off year. What are you expect for thi year?Danoff:Act manag had a horribl year last year. But with the new administr and a cyclic orient in the global economi and especi the U.S. economy, I think activ manag is go to do veri well in the forese future.Fundament will matter a lot more. The kind of research we do at Fidel is go to matter a lot more. REITs, utilities, consum stapl are low growth and now rel highli valued. Interest rate go up are go to creat an OK tail wind for activ fund managers.IBD:So you expect 2017 to be better for Contrafund?Danoff:Low interest rates, polit uncertainti and deceler growth in emerg market propel big, 'safe' group to unsustain high valuat (in 2016). These includ integr oil companies, telecommun companies, utilities, REIT (real estat invest trusts) and consum staples. These groups, which repres about a quarter of the S&P 500 the past year, could fall if interest rate continu to climb.Th elect of Donald Trump wa a signific regim chang and the new administr is expect to pursu pro-growth policies. I believ rate will rise thi year, and that stock select and earn growth will play a much bigger role in stock perform in 2017.I believ that stock follow earn over time, so better compani that can grow earn faster will do better than the rest of the market. I am confid that, with the help of Fidelity' global research team, I can find what I consid the best invest for the fund.IBD:What' your biggest take-away from the elections?Danoff:Th elect of Trump ha chang the direct of fiscal policy. He'll pursu a more deregulatori agenda. He'll emphas U.S. manufacturing. So I'm go to take a more pro-cycl tilt, which will mean find some growth cyclicals. Interest rate will continu to back up. What group will benefit from that? I'll be ad to my alreadi heavi bet on financials.IBD:You'v got 13 stock that are onth IBD 50 list, which are lead growth stock show strong rel price strength and top-notch fundamentals.Danoff:It' just a coincidence. But let' face it. I'm paid to beat the market. I have to have stock that are beat the market.IBD:Broadcom' earn per share growth ha accelerated. What' your thesis? (Share are up 24% thi year.)Danoff:Their manag ha done an excel job acquir smaller semiconductor compani and cut costs, emphas the higher-margin, more differenti product in the acquisitions. They gener a lot of free cash flow, which enabl them to make more acquisitions.CEO Tan Hock ha done an excel job focus on R&D. A stronger economi should be good for semiconductors. (Analysts') earn estim are increasing.IBD:Netflix' EP growth ha acceler for three straight quarter after six quarter of declines. What' your view? (Share are up 12% thi year.)Danoff:CEO Reed Hast from the begin had a vision of how consum don't want linear TV, they want show when they want them. And he' done a great job of acquir other people' content and now creat hi own exclus content. He' offer outstand qualiti TV at a veri reason price and in an easy-to-us format. That formula still ha legs.IBD:How so?Danoff:He' find that peopl in Brazil and Germani want to watch the same type of program as peopl do in the U.S. So as he grow member overseas, he can leverag content costs. Hi pole posit in internet TV and the franchis he' built justifi Netflix' high valuation.IBD' TAKE:Netflix is rank No. 1 in IBD' Leisure-Movi & Relat industri group. Check-out the stock' growth metric in the easy-to-understand fundament and technic data roundup atIBD' Stock Checkup.IBD:Amazon' quarterli EP deceler ha been sharp. Are you concerned? (Share are up 13% thi year.)Danoff:I think the earn slowdown is partli optics. To me, the innov with Alexa (Amazon' interact person assistant) ha been powerful. Amazon Web Servic grew onli 47% last quarter, but that' a $14 billion (annual) run rate. That' nice profitable.Prim is a great service. It' gain a lot of market share.Amazon ha issues, but they'r on them and I like how manag ha navig and continu to grow. For a compani to be innov at $130 billion of revenu is realli special. I wouldn't want to bet against them. How mani $380-billion-market-cap compani grow 20% a year? And gener a lot of free cash flow? Yes, the stock bounc around.

Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Microsoft;3/6/2017;"They'r two of the five largest publicli trade compani in the world. They'r technolog giant that are increasingli compet against one anoth in multibillion-dollar growth industri such as cloud comput and artifici intelligence. They'reAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .And they'r vastli differ compani in term of their core oper focuses, their recent histories, and their cultures. So which is the better buy today? Let' examin Amazon.com and Microsoft through three analyt lenses, to determin which tech stalwart repres the better stock to buy today.Financi fortitudeThough both compani are financi behemoths, Microsoft beat Amazon in thi comparison of financi fortitude. Here' a quick summari of sever import liquid and solvenc measur for each company.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioMicrosoft$122.7 billion$84.9 billion$36.7 billion2.1Amazon.com$25.9 billion$7.7 billion$16.4 billion1.0Data sources: Amazon.com and Microsoft investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.Microsoft and Amazon are in fine financi shape. However, even though Microsoft carri more debt than Amazon, it earn a win in thi categori by beat the world' largest e-commerc provid in three categories. Plus, onli $600 million of Microsoft' borrow will come due thi calendar year. The overwhelm major of Microsoft' debt come due after 2020, and then at veri low interest rates. Given the company' cash flow gener capabilities, servic that debt should be no issu for Microsoft.It also bear note that Microsoft, likeApple, keep the bulk of it cash hold oversea to shield it from repatri taxes. In it most recent 10-Q, the compani didn't disclos how much cash lie offshore, but it annual 10-K file show that it kept approxim 96% overseas. But sinc it gener plenti of oper cash flow to fund it domest and intern operations, thi is realli a non-issu for investors.Winner: Microsoft.Dur competit advantagesMicrosoft and Amazon.com each enjoy competit advantages, albeit of differ sorts. Amazon' primari moat are it scale and risk-tak culture. At thi point, Microsoft' competit insul seem more structur and historic. Let' unpack each of those a bit more.Amazon gener the bulk of it sale from it core e-commerc operations, account for 91% of revenu in 2016. As the world' largest e-commerc site by revenue, Amazon ha an incred scale that allow it to consist offer low prices. More impress still, Amazon' uniqu abil to turn it own platform into sourc of revenu -- think Amazon Web Services,Fulfil by Amazon, third-parti ad on Amazon.com, and so on -- allow it to charg the lowest price possibl on it e-commerc site, which in turn attract more customers. Thi self-regener busi philosophi is best summar in the idea of theFlywheel Effect, which is at the core of Amazon' strategi and touch on it uniqu culture.Imag Source: Amazon.comTo creat a cultur that could invent profit center to buoy it low- or even negative-margin e-commerc sales, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo and hi team need to creat a cultur where risk-tak and unconvent think were the norm. Bezo summar risk-taking' foundat place in Amazon' cultur in the 2015 annual letter:A word about corpor cultures: For better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change. ... One area where I think we are especi distinct is failure. I believ we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenti of practice!), and failur and invent are insepar twins.Without it uniqu corpor mindset, Amazon never would have had the audaci and vision to launch mani of it most import initiatives, make it cultur arguabl it most import asset and sourc of endur competit advantage.Microsoft' sourc of competit advantage, on the other hand, can be summar in one word: ""Office."" It remain Microsoft' financi heart and soul and is the largest revenu sourc at the company, singlehandedli account for $23.5 billion, or 27%, of Microsoft' $85.3 billion in sale in fiscal 2016.CEO Satya Nadella' 2015-16 reorgan of Microsoft' oper creat three new report segments: product and busi process (PBP), intellig cloud, and more person computing. PBP hous the consum and commerci Offic operations, as well as Microsoft' Dynam CRM platform. The entir segment gener $26.5 billion of Microsoft' total sales, so we know, use the Offic revenu figure, that Offic drive the segment' performance.It import come into greater focu when look at Microsoft' operating-profit breakdown. PBP -- again, mostli Offic -- gener $12.4 billion, or 62%, of Microsoft' $20.1 billion in fiscal 2016 oper income, make it the financi bellweth that guid Microsoft' financi performance.Oth segments, particularli Intellig Cloud, have becom increasingli import piec of Microsoft' financi footprint as well. However, Microsoft' core competit advantag still lie in the fact that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint make up the default product softwar for the major of world' computer-us population, and that' a sourc of tremend advantag -- and profit -- for the company.Winner: Tie.ValuationCompar the valuat of Microsoft and Amazon isn't the simplest exercise, given their differ growth profiles. With that in mind, here are three of the most commonli use valuat metric for each company.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAMicrosoft30.219.716.8Amazon.com173.766.134.1EV = ENTERPRIS VALUE. EBITDA = EARN BEFOR INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Her we get a great comparison of two invest style -- growth versu value. Neither come out ahead here. More conserv investor who prefer to own stock with someth of a margin of safeti will probabl be drawn to Microsoft, with it more conserv valuat and 2.3% dividend yield. Of course, those same investor have alway argu that Amazon is overvalued, even as the company' stock ascend ever higher.From the perspect of a long-term investor, I believ Amazon' abil to grow at above-averag rate for years, if not decad to come, will enabl it to grow into and beyond it current valuation. Microsoft' main issue, meanwhile, remain it growth outlook.Thi analysi is somewhat subjective. More risk-avers investors, particularli those near retirement, might want to stay away from Amazon stock. However, for those with the abil to buy and hold a compani for a decad or more, I like Amazon despit it aggress valuat today.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... Amazon, by a noseBoth Amazon and Microsoft offer investor attract invest opportunities, in veri differ ways. As I mentioned, Microsoft is probabl a better option for more risk-avers investors. It' a stable, matur compani and should deriv the bulk of it financi return from grow profit and EPS, rather than through rapidli expand it top line. Amazon' growth trajectory, meanwhile, is generational, as it look to rewrit the rule of the global retail industry. In the end, Amazon strike me as the better stock for long-term investor to buy today.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At the time, Bloomberg note that HHGregg, which ha lost money in it previou two fiscal years, want to avoid Chapter 11 and wa in the midst of seek an out-of-court solution.

2 Top E-Commerce Stocks to Buy;3/3/2017;"The growth of e-commerc continu to be a bounti field for investor to find great stocks.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Commerc Depart report that e-commerc sale increas 14.3% year over year to $102.7 billion, while total retail sale increas 4.1% in the same period. E-commerc sale repres onli 8.3% of total retail sale in the U.S. alon give compani likePayP Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL) andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) a long growth runway.Thes two onlin behemoth are in the sweet spot of a long-term shift in how peopl all over the world are transact in commerc and repres great choic for investor to consider.makeArticleAd();E-commerc is booming. Imag source: Pixabay.PayP HoldingsAccord toDatanyze, PayPal domin onlin shop with a 76.8% share of websit who offer similar payment options. Thi onlin domin led PayPal to process 6.1 billion total transact in 2016, an increas of 24% over 2015. The actual dollar amount process -- or total payment volum (TPV) -- wa $354 billion, which increas 28% year over year.Management'sstrategyto grow TPV ha been to spread PayPal' payment servic to as mani place as possible. The more way custom can use PayPal, the more custom it can reach. Sinc it spun off fromeBay, PayPal ha been on a tear, sign partnership with major credit card issuer and bank likeMastercard,Visa,Discov Financi Services, andCitigroup. With these deals, custom will be abl to use their credit card in their PayPal digit wallet wherev contactless payment are accepted.An addit sourc of growth in the futur will be the social payment servic Venmo. Venmo' TPV increas 126% to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Thi is an annual run rate of about $20 billion -- less than 10% of PayPal' total payment volum -- but thi percentag should grow over time.A a result of current busi momentum and the expect increas in payment volum from recent partnerships, manag expect revenu growth to be 16% to 17% over the next three years, and PayPal' profit should grow in line with revenue.Tak a look at the stock' current valuation, theprice-to-earningsratio on expect 2017 earn is about 25. PayPal gener $10 billion of revenu last year and manag place it address market near $100 trillion. Given the larg runway of growth ahead, the valuat look veri reasonable.Amazon.comAmazon ha complet chang the game for retail. It rapid growth over the last 20 year left mani tradit big box retail likeWal-Mart Storesscrambl to catch up.Amazon' net sale have grown from $511 million in it first full year of oper in 1995 to $135.9 billion in 2016, and there are still a lot of area in the world Amazon ha yet to penetrate.Th key ingredi to Amazon' success ha been the cultur of experiment that CEO and founder Jeff Bezo ha instil throughout the company. In hi 2015 sharehold letter, he wrote:On area where I think we are especi distinct is failure. I believ we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenti of practice!), and failur and invent are insepar twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advanc that it' go to work, it' not an experiment. Most larg organ embrac the idea of invention, but are not will to suffer the string of fail experi necessari to get there. Outsiz return often come from bet against convent wisdom, and convent wisdom is usual right. Given a ten percent chanc of a 100 time payoff, you should take that bet everi time. But you'r still go to be wrong nine time out of ten. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you'r go to strike out a lot, but you'r also go to hit some home runs.Thi approach ha a direct connect to Amazon' growth. Amazon' fast-grow cloud-comput servic -- Amazon Web Servic (AWS) -- seem an odd fit with it retail business, but in fact AW fit the company' core mission to be the world' ""most customer-centr company."" AW ha been beat the competit in cloud servic through the same relentless focu on give custom the best valu and the best servic available.In addit to AWS, Amazon Prime wa start as an experi and ha been a crucial compon to the company' growth in recent years. As a market pitch for Prime, Jeff Bezo wrote in hi 2015 letter, ""We want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irrespons not to be a member."" Be a Prime member myself, I can attest there is a lot of truth to hi claim.Th success of Prime ha disrupt the entir retail industri and chang the expect of shopper with free two-day ship along with other benefits, make the compani the gold standard of how onlin shop should be done.Amazon is constantli pile other goodi on top of free ship like Prime Video, Music, and special exclus deal on certain item for Prime member which creat a veri sticki service. At the end of the day, Jeff Bezo is right: You realli do feel it would be irrespons to cancel your membership.Al together, Amazon' net sale grew 27% in 2016 and cash from oper balloon to $16.4 billion. From day one, CEO Jeff Bezo ha state that the goal is to maxim long-term free cash flow. Thi focu ha allow the compani to expand it fulfil center infrastructur while keep a sound balanc sheet. At the end of 2016, Amazon had $25.9 billion in cash and market secur with $7.7 billion in long-term debt.Th stock ha track the growth in net sale and cash flow over time, and I expect it to do so in the year to come.

Last year, it launch the Twilio Enterpris Plan, which ad security, access management, and administr tool for larg organ -- all product which a former Salesforc COO could like improve.What Twilio can learn from SalesforceA the top cloud-bas CRM (custom relationship management) servic vendor in the world, Salesforc ha proven that the Saa model can becom profitable. The Saa market is gener a tough one to profit in, due to price competit and the high cost of secur custom and develop new services.Th main way to counter those pressur are to scale up, maintain a ""best in breed"" reputation, and lock in custom with a wide array of new services. Salesforc scale up by acquir smaller compani and integr their servic into it ecosystem, and maintain it market lead posit with big enterpris partnerships.It also diversifi it busi into four core pillar of growth -- the Sale Cloud, Servic Cloud, Market Cloud, and Salesforc Platform.

Fidelity's Will Danoff Talks About The Super Bowl And Super Stocks;3/3/2017;"Ride just one growth stock to big gain is alway a challenge. But Will Danoff doe it so often that Fidel Contrafund ha becom a $107 billion behemoth that' return an averag annual 12.94% dure hi more than 27 year at the helm.That put Danoff' perform in the top 4.8% ofU.S. diversifi stock fundsthat have been around that long, accord to Morningstar Inc. Hi masteri of the stock market (the S&P 500 trail Contrafund with an averag annual 10.17%) ha attract a mountain of investor assets, make Contra Fidelity' largest activ manag fund and the third-largest activ run industrywide.And Danoff and Contra are at it again thi year, prove onc again that a big fund can outmaneuv more-nimbl smaller funds. The fund' 10.23% gain through March 1 top the S&P 500 as well as hi peer' average.makeArticleAd();In a recent convers with IBD, Danoff, 56, talk about the scienc of investing, lesson to be learn from the New England Patriot Super Bowl champ and invest opportun he see in the Trump era. And, oh yeah, Danoff went over what he like about sever of hi recent top holdings, includingBroadcom(AVGO),Netflix(NFLX) andAmazon(AMZN).IBD:You'r a Boston guy, Will. What did you think about the Super Bowl?Danoff:For me, sport is a lot like business. You know, how to build a team. How to find all-stars, who can put the ball in the end zone. There wa a lot of psycholog at work in that game. And it show the import of preparation.What the Patriot taught us is to keep look forward. They don't dwell on their mistakes. And they made a fair number of mistak in that game. (They were trail 28-3 in the final minut of the third quarter.) The lesson for investor is, they stay focus on their goals.IBD:How is a game like invest in stocks?Danoff:Th stock market is a veri emot beast. You get knock over. But the import thing is to stand back up. Over and over, you tri to do better. And the opportun come. You just have to prepar for them.IBD:Will, for peopl who may not be familiar with the fund and are confus by it name - doe it invest in weird stocks?Danoff:No, Contrafund is a capit appreci fund with a growth bias. I think over time stock price follow earn per share. If a compani can doubl it earn over the next five years, most like the stock will doubl it share price, plu or minu a little.IBD:Summar what you look for in stocks.Danoff:I'm look for compani that are well-posit in their industry, run by experienc manag team who are enthusiast about what they do, are honor peopl who accept that industri as cyclical, so they make prudent capit alloc decisions.I'v also found that invest with manag that ha a larg ownership stake and therefor are on the same side of the tabl as sharehold is a good thing to do.IBD:How ha experi made you fine-tun your invest approach?Danoff:I'v seen over and over, you have to be careful. I have over time becom more disciplin and sensit to what I'm pay for earn growth.There' no reward for degre of difficulti in investing. You don't have to be the first investor to find a good story. You can be cautious. If a stock ha alreadi doubl or tripled, it doesn't mean you'v miss it. If it' go to doubl or tripl again, it' probabl still a buy. It' like sport matches. Who care what happen on the last point scored? You'r play thi point now.IBD:Let' talk stocks. In each case, I'm ask about your thesi as of your latest disclosure.HealthEquity(HQY) run platform where consum can access tax-advantag health care save and check treatment options. You open your stake in Novemb and boost it in December. Whi the interest?Danoff:Influenc by (IBD founder) Bill O'Neil and others, I'v been intrigu by opportun in new compani to the market. Fidel creat a new global fund (Fidel Insight Class) for Canadian investors, launch in the past few weeks, that let' me cast a wider net for small- and midcap companies.IBD:So you learn about HealthEqu while do research for the Canadian fund?Danoff:Right. I ask analyst on that fund to bring small and midcap idea becaus the new fund allow me to take smaller positions. HealthEqu is a provid of health save account (HSAs), which is a grow sector in human resources. Compani that are grow 40% a year are attractive. The whole health care system is move toward more consum participation, which can help control health care costs. Peopl went to a doctor, onli paid a $5 or $10 copay, so they didn't hesit to ask about everi littl ache. That' financi unsustainable. HSA are part of the solution.IBD:Your long-term outperform is notable, but 2016 wa an off year. What are you expect for thi year?Danoff:Act manag had a horribl year last year. But with the new administr and a cyclic orient in the global economi and especi the U.S. economy, I think activ manag is go to do veri well in the forese future.Fundament will matter a lot more. The kind of research we do at Fidel is go to matter a lot more. REITs, utilities, consum stapl are low growth and now rel highli valued. Interest rate go up are go to creat an OK tail wind for activ fund managers.IBD:What' your biggest take-away from the elections?Danoff:Th elect of Trump ha chang the direct of fiscal policy. He'll pursu a more deregulatori agenda. He'll emphas U.S. manufacturing. So I'm go to take a more pro-cycl tilt, which will mean find some growth cyclicals. Interest rate will continu to back up. What group will benefit from that? I'll be ad to my alreadi heavi bet on financials.IBD:You'v got 13 stock that are onth IBD 50 list, which are lead growth stock show strong rel price strength and top-notch fundamentals.Danoff:It' just a coincidence. But let' face it. I'm paid to beat the market. I have to have stock that are beat the market.IBD:Broadcom' earn per share growth ha accelerated. What' your thesis?Danoff:Their manag ha done an excel job acquir smaller semiconductor compani and cut costs, emphas the higher-margin, more differenti product in the acquisitions. They gener a lot of free cash flow, which enabl them to make more acquisitions.CEO Tan Hock ha done an excel job focus on R&D. A stronger economi should be good for semiconductors. (Analysts') earn estim are increasing.IBD:Netflix' EP growth ha acceler for three straight quarter after six quarter of declines. What' your view?Danoff:CEO Reed Hast from the begin had a vision of how consum don't want linear TV, they want show when they want them. And he' done a great job of acquir other people' content and now creat hi own exclus content. He' offer outstand qualiti TV at a veri reason price and in an easy-to-us format. That formula still ha legs.IBD:How so?Danoff:He' find that peopl in Brazil and Germani want to watch the same type of program as peopl do in the U.S. So as he grow member overseas, he can leverag content costs. Hi pole posit in internet TV and the franchis he' built justifi Netflix' high valuation.IBD' TAKE:Netflix is rank No. 1 in IBD' Leisure-Movi & Relat industri group. Check-out the stock' growth metric in the easy-to-understand fundament and technic data roundup atIBD' Stock Checkup.IBD:Amazon' quarterli EP deceler ha been sharp. Are you concerned?Danoff:I think the earn slowdown is partli optics. To me, the innov with Alexa (Amazon' interact person assistant) ha been powerful. Amazon Web Servic grew onli 47% last quarter, but that' a $14 billion (annual) run rate. That' nice profitable.Prim is a great service. It' gain a lot of market share.Amazon ha issues, but they'r on them and I like how manag ha navig and continu to grow. For a compani to be innov at $130 billion of revenu is realli special. I wouldn't want to bet against them. How mani $380-billion-market-cap compani grow 20% a year? And gener a lot of free cash flow? Yes, the stock bounc around. Given the high price-earn ratio (around 170), mayb the stock will be volatile.IBD:Y open your current stake inNvidia(NVDA) last March. You increas your stake nine-fold in July. What do you like there?Danoff:They'r the leader in GPU and graphic chips, which histor have been use in gaming, PC gaming, which ha continu to grow. But in the last coupl of years, compani that oper server realiz that string of GPU (graphic process units) can power their comput need more effici than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia' GPU are be use in high perform data center like Amazon Web Services' and the big social cloud like Facebook' and Microsoft' Azur (which is an enterprise-grad cloud comput program). So Nvidia ha addit growth there.A third area of growth is in machin learn and in applic like IBM Watson and driverless cars, where comput need to process a tremend amount of data quickly.Th data-cent and autonom drive market are grow fast. Nvidia is in the pole position. Their revenu are accelerating, their margin improving.IBD:Your current stake inCitizen Financial(CFG) began in December. Whi did you start buying?Danoff:Citizen is a much smaller posit bought as part of a basket of banks. I can take my time see which I want to keep.IBD:Y began yourAppli Materials(AMAT) stake in May and increas your stake in June, July, Novemb and December. What ha your thesi been?Danoff:Semiconductor stocks' perform is tie to an improv economy. And as semiconductor compani do well, they buy more of the semiconductor cap equip that Appli Materi has.Appli is a leader in OLE technolog - organ light emit diod technology. In the past six months, we'v seen order in that subsector explode. Some peopl say OLE will onli be use in premium smartphones. My bet is that the price will fall enough to expand OLE penetr to the midtier.IBD:What prompt you to trim yourLogMeIn(LOGM) stake in Novemb and December?Danoff:They did a nice deal withCitrix(CTXS). Their videoconfer busi merg with Citrix in a tax effici way. It will slow their growth, but it give them a strong competit position.It show the import of manag think like owners. You can't predict the future, but you can say you trust manag that you'v been watch for three or four years. It' like hire a veteran in football. You know he'll make tackles, won't drop passes. You tri to fill your roster with folk you have confid in.With LogMeIn manag did a good deal and the stori got better.IBD:You'v been run Contrafund a long time. How do you avoid go stale?Danoff:On of the strength of Fidel is that we have a small armi of young analysts, who haven't been beaten up by time. I like our mix of experi as well as young and enthusiast analysts. You need youth to be current with what' happen in technology.RELATED:How Fidel Contrafund Manag Will Danoff Play The DownturnWil Danoff Plu John Roth Equal Top-Perform Fidel New Insight Fund"

After all, sale grew by a nothing-to-sneez at 27% to $136 billion for the full year, power a three-fold increas in profit over 2015.Cash flow also jump 38% to $16.4 billion, and the company' latest growth engine, Amazon Web Servic (AWS) deliv a solid 47% in it quarterli sales.So, what'snotto like about AMZN stock right now?Manag did trim, to put it mildly, it profit outlook for 2017 with a rang of $250 million to $900 million versu the Street' forecast of $1.33 billion.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The good news is Amazon' warn isn't nearli as damag as it look on first inspection.

My best estim is there' some like pressur in Amazon' near future.First off, one warn is that Amazon share offici broke out on Feb. 21 but have had difficulti go higher. Also worrisom is Amazon' abil to ralli strongli past the breakout level, which ha been accompani by less-than-terrif volum and a lack of support from stochastics.W expect modest profit-taking, so if you'r interest in buy AMZN, there are better time - and way - to enter.How to Trade AMZN StockFor investor that do wish to eventu purchas AMZN stock at slightli more advantag price or mayb a much larger discount and get paid to wait it out-a credit put spread look attractive.Review Amazon' option and given our view of share prone to at least a modest pullback, the Weekli 07' April $815 / $810 put spread is price for $1.00 with AMZN stock at $847.60.I the Revers in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buy Opportunity?Th real disadvantag with thi strategi is if our forecast is wrong and share of Amazon ralli higher by a meaning amount. Were that to occur, the trader' $1.00 in profit will look like a poor decis rel to buy AMZN stock today.But if AMZN sit or simpli fail to drop below $815 or nearli 4% over the next five weeks, the full credit is captur and the trader will be sit pretti compar to a more bullish trader that simpli purchas stock.Even better, if more aggress profit-tak doe happen, ultim the vertic limit the investor' risk to $4.00 regardless of how low AMZN stock might go dure the spread' hold period.

Wal-Mart is Acting More Like Amazon, But That May Not Help Its Shareholders;3/3/2017;"GiveWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) some credit.Aft year of be asleep at the retail wheel, under the leadership of CEO Doug McMilllon the compani is final respond to the biggest threat it faces:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Over the past year or so, Wal-Mart made sever decis to make itself more competit as retail shop pattern shift. The compani rais it minimum wage to $10/hour and revamp it train and promot process in an attempt to improv store performance. The decis seem to be a result of management' realiz that oper a bare-bon busi to keep price down and squeez out profit is no longer a viabl long-term strategy. Wal-Mart' custom satisfact score have long lag the industry, a sharp contrast to those of Amazon and rivalCostco Wholesale, which rank at the top of the retail sector.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart also took the bold step of acquir the start-up e-commerc busi Jet.com for $3.3 billion last summer. Some critic derid the move, say Wal-Mart overpaid for a compani that wa bare a year old, while other call it an ""acqui-hire,"" impli that Wal-Mart bought the compani just to bring founder Marc Lore on board. But Wal-Mart ha deep pockets, and it need to ramp up it e-commerc busi as fast as possible. Alreadi the move seem be have a posit effect, as Wal-Mart' e-commerc growth acceler to 29% in the fourth quarter, up from just singl digit earlier in the year. Strategically, the compani is also becom more aggress as it unveil free two-day ship for order over $35, a move that prompt Amazon to follow suit, lower it free-ship minimum to match Wal-Mart.Sinc it purchas Jet, Wal-Mart ha made some smaller e-commerc acquisit and aggress expand it onlin groceri pickup program. The compani also sharpli scale back new store open thi year in order to invest in it current store base and improv e-commerc operations.Whi it may not pay off for shareholdersTh strateg shift is clear. Like Amazon, Wal-Mart is show it' will to sacrific profit to build it busi for the long-term. Profit shrunk thi year due to the wage hike, and they are expect to remain flat. Manag ha project them to grow modestli next year.However, while becom more like Amazon by embrac e-commerce, sacrif short-term profits, and improv the custom experi is the right thing to do for the business, it may not do much to push Wal-Mart' stock higher.That' becaus investor perceiv the two stock differently. Amazon Founder Jeff Bezo told investor he wa build a compani for the long-term from it inception. Though hi busi ha put up scant profit throughout it history, investor have made it one of the most valuabl compani on the market. Amazon ha continu to hold a triple-digit earn valuat as it ha consist deliv strong revenu growth, and develop valuabl competit advantag in area like e-commerc and cloud comput that are expect to translat into profit over the year to come.Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is valu as a tradit retailer. It carri a P/E ratio of 15, which seem fair for it growth prospect and competit position. Wal-Mart' sharehold own the stock becaus it ha been a reliabl dividend payer, not for it growth prospects.Amazon ha earn the right to be treat as an exception. Wal-Mart ha not. Even as the compani transit to challeng Amazon more directly, the stock is unlik to move higher unless the compani can demonstr strong revenu or profit growth, which seem like to be modest over the come year even with the aggress move recently.Mak Wal-Mart' situat even more challeng is the near certainti that Amazon will continu to expand and enhanc it operations. Wal-Mart may be paddl faster, but the water' onli rising.Amazon is constantli build new fulfil center to speed up deliveries, and theWal Street Journalsaid the compani had plan to open up as mani as 2,000 groceri store across the countri over the next ten years. Amazon deni that story, but the compani did unveil it new Amazon Go conveni store, with technolog that preclud cashiers, in December.Warren Buffett acknowledg Wal-Mart' challeng in a recentCNBCinterview explain whi he sold nearli all of hi stake in the company. Buffett call retail ""too tough,"" ad about Amazon, ""That is a tough, tough, tough competit force. Now Walmart is push forward onlin themselves. They have got all kind of strengths, but I just decid that I'd look for a littl easier game.""Investor may want to consid Buffett' wisdom. The upshot for Wal-Mart sharehold seem to be that the compani will continu to make need improvements, but it will like be year befor the stock see a signific respons to those efforts.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets – Literally;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' been a strong - and long-await - run forAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. AAPL stock is up 19% year-to-d as of thi writing, and ha gain by about one-third sinc the U.S. presidenti election. Appl stock struggl for some time, hit an 18-month low below $90 in May. But clearli investor sentiment ha turned.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, overal investor sentiment ha improv as well. Broad market have strengthen in 2017 and sinc the election. TheDow Jone Industri Average- as imperfect a measur as it is - clear 21,000 on Wednesday. But AAPL stock itself ha been a major driver of those broad market gains.Just how much Appl stock - and, to a lesser extent, issu of other titan such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - ha move those indic might surpris you.How Appl Stock Impact the S&P 500The S&P500i up 6.9% year-to-d as of thi writing. That index consist of the 500 most import stock in the U.S. market (not necessarili the largest), and compris 70%-80% of total U.S. market capitalization, accord to Standard & Poor' itself.It would thu seem that AAPL on it own couldn't move the index all that much. After all, 1 out of 500 is a small fraction, even as big as Appl is. Yet Appl stock still drive about 3.6% of the index' returns.Snapchat IPO: Lofti Snap Inc (SNAP) Walk on EggshellsGiven a 19% YTD return, then, Appl alon ha push the S&P 500 higher by about 0.69% in just two months. Fulli one-tenth of the broad market index' growth ha comejust from AAPL.And Appl isn't the onli large-cap driver. AMZN stock, now up 9% for the year, ha ad 0.2 points, or 3%, of the index' growth. The three largest financi in the index -JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM),Wel Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) andBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) - have ad roughli 7% of the S&P 500' perform so far in 2017.In other words, roughli 20% of the broad market' gain in 2017 from come just from five major stocks. And the figur sinc the elect is actual abov one-quarter, with the three major financi creat 15% of the S&P' 12%-plu post-elect gains.That' not to say that market strength is a mirage. Fulli three-quart of S&P 500 stock are posit in 2017 as of thi writing. But it ha been a more top-heavi market than usual - and the impact of Appl stock, in particular, is even higher in other well-known indexes.AAPL and the Dow Jone Industri AverageTh DJIA is differ from most other indic in that it' weight by price, not market value. The most heavili weight compon in the Dow isGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS), becaus it stock price is over $250. The least import Dow Jone compon isGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE), trade just abov $30.Yes, it' weird.That mean Appl stock actual ha the seventh-highest weight in the DJIA. (AMZN isn't even excluded, becaus of it $800-plu handle.) But Apple' strong gain still mean that it ha driven over 12% of the Dow Jones' year-to-d increase.Appl isn't alon in drive the index.Bo Co(NYSE:BA) ha ad anoth 12%, GS roughli 9% and JPM anoth 8%. Again, the gain are somewhat concentrated; over 40% of the Dow' year-to-d increas is come from just these four stocks.Still, like in the S&P 500, the gain are broad-based. Onli four Dow compon are in the red in 2017, includ the two energi issues.Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) both have declin in 2017. But the 7% increas YTD ha come in larg part from just a few stock - and, like the S&P 500, the same is true sinc November.Appl and the Nasdaq-100Th Nasdaq-100 is a tech titan-heavi index. Thus, it should be no surpris that AAPL stock ha a major weight in the index. Appl repres almost 12% of the Nasdaq-100 - the year' best-perform major index so far, with an increas just under 11%.Appl stock ha been the major driver, account for over 20% of that growth.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha ad anoth 9%, as ha AMZN.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017Some 40% of the index' YTD gain have come from those three stocks. And they haven't had as much help from their fellow tech titans.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) actual have lag the Nasdaq-100 so far thi year. That might be a good thing if those stock pick up the pace - but it doe leav the index somewhat reliant on just a few key issues.Of course, that' the natur of the Nasdaq-100, rel to the S&P 500 in particular, which ha more stock and a broader mandate.But no matter the index, Appl stock is important. And that just show how embed it is in the U.S. invest world. Pretti much everi index ha signific exposur to AAPL - which mean that most diversifi investor own Appl in some way, shape or form.Th strength in the broad market in 2017 hasn't come sole from AAPL stock - but it ha helped. And long investor - even those who don't own Appl share directli - should be root for Appl to keep climbing.Th author ha no direct posit in ani secur mention … but like most investor doe own index fund which includ secur mentioned, includ AAPL.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best Stock to Buy and Hold ForeverHow to Handl Red-Hot Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

3 Times Amazon Responded Directly to Competitive Threats;3/1/2017;"There are mani factor that makeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) a uniqu company. It ha plung itself headlong into a number of emerg markets, includ e-commerce, cloud computing, and video streaming. It' been will to sacrific profit for long-term growth and market share in a way that no other compani of it size has. But the company' cultur ha also set it apart.Ther are mani Bezo mantra that guid the company, but none doe more so than this: ""Put the custom first. Invent. And be patient."" Bezo say those three guidelin have been the secret to the company' success.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Elabor on the first point, Bezo ha repeatedli said that the compani is obsess with custom rather than focus on competitors, and that it respond to custom need rather than competit threats.However, Bezo is well known as a cutthroat competitor, and foster a competit environ both within the compani and the market it doe busi in. He ha famous said about rivals, ""Your margin is my opportunity."" Though the idea that Amazon onli care about custom and not competitor may buffer the company' imag as a consum darling, it' far from the truth. Here are three occasions, includ one just last week, when Amazon respond directli and determinedli to competit threats.1. Free ship and Wal-MartA year ago, Amazon lift it minimum order for free ship for Non-Prim member from $35 to $49. The move wa seen as a push by Amazon to encourag custom who hadn't alreadi to sign up for Prime memberships, and to trim explod ship costs.In the past year,Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) ha step up it focu on e-commerce, expand it onlin groceri pickup program and acquir Jet.com for $3.3 billion. As part of that strategy, Wal-Mart said a month ago that it would offer free two-day ship on order of $35 or more in an attempt to challeng Amazon Prime. Just a few week after Wal-Mart made that announcement, Amazon lower it free-ship minimum again to $35, back down from $49, in a clear respons to Wal-Mart. Notably, Amazon doe not promis two-day ship for such orders, reserv that benefit for Prime members.Still, the move show how close Amazon is guard it advantag in e-commerc and it reput for fast, free shipping.2. Diapers.com face-offIn 2010, Amazon notic that it diaper sales, a key categori as it help bring in new parents, were slipping, go instead to upstart Quidsi, which own Diapers.com. Amazon dealt with the problem by attempt to buy Quidsi, but when it wa rebuf it respond by drop it diaper price by as much as a third in an attempt to strongarm Quidsi into a sale. Although Quidsi also receiv a bid from Wal-Mart, Amazon' strategi prove success and it bought Quidsi for $545 million in Novemb 2010.Notably, Amazon is face off again with Quidsi co-found Marc Lore, who went on to found Jet.com after a two-year stint with Amazon follow the Quidsi purchase. Lore now ha Wal-Mart' back as he attempt anoth assault on Amazon, yet anoth reason whi thi rivalri is onli heat up.3. Everyday price algorithmAmazon' sophist price algorithm, which it adjust million of time a day, is perhap the best exampl of how the compani is often more focus on competitor than customers. The company, for instance, often priorit product it sell over those sold by thrid-parti vendor on it marketplac even when those are cheaper, accord to a studi by ProPublica. Amazon also give an advantag to vendor who pay it for servic such as fulfillment.Oddli enough, Amazon' closest competitor are sometim those vendor sell on it website.Anoth studi show that Amazon manipul price percept by often offer a discount on the most popular items, but rare do so on less popular ones, creat the percept that it offer the lowest price when that' often not the case.Th compani may deserv it reput for put the custom first, as it often make allow that other busi might not, and program like Prime have been custom favorit -- but it' foolish to assum that Amazon ignor competit action just becaus it say so. Like ani other business, it need to respond to rival in order to grow and succeed.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Specifically, Nomura' Simeon Siegel cut the outfit to""reduce""and warn Under Armour' day as a fast-growth compani are over and UAA' current share price still reflect a rich multipl that need to come down.On the heel of the report UAA stock shed 4.09% to $20.62 and a bit closer to Nomura' below-market price target of $16.UAA Stock Monthli ChartClick to EnlargeLook at the monthli price chart of Under Armour and it' obviou the halcyon day of go-go growth expectations, upgrad and analyst accolad are well-remov from today' reality.But is $16 a share in UAA stock a realist forecast?

Let' face it, AW is critic for AMZN stock.Last year, thi busi segment report a56% spike in revenu to $12.2 billionand oper incom came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million activ customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Servic essenti subsid the core ecommerc busi - which ha razor-thin margin - but also allow for the heavi invest in effort like video/mus streaming, Alexa and devic like the Kindle.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017A for the AW outage, it last roughlyfour hoursand result in the disrupt of thousand of websit and cloud app across the US. Some of the high-profil compani that were impact includedAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Twitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) andTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO).At the heart of thi wa the failur of the S3 system, which provid for the effici storag of content.

For the most part, Amazon Web Servic ha a great track record, with uptim that is over 99%. As a result, whenev there is a major outage, there is quit a bit of buzz.Besides, AW is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN ha ad great featur - such as for data analytics, AI (artifici intelligence) and improv secur function - and ha also been dilig with lower pricing. Yet, thi doe not mean the outag is trivial. It' reason to assum that there are mani compani that are evalu the situation. After all, should there be more usag of altern systems?Well, I think so. Note that other internet giant are leverag their own system to provid cloud services, as seen withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).

Sinc Januari 2009, Alphabet stock is up 460%, while AT&T stock rose onli 49%. And telecom like AT&T particularli resent the fact that internet compani like Alphabet and Facebook gain these profit while piggyback on the equip the telecom spent ten of billion of dollar installing. You wouldn't be abl to access websit such as thi one or Facebook without the help of a telecom, such as AT&T.On the other hand, when peopl access Facebook or search Google, they are use data, which mean more busi for telecoms.But tech compani hurt telecom when they cannib their revenu with app like Viber and Messeng and WhatsApp. Use WhatsApp is cheaper than send a text message, and ha causedtext messag volumeto decline.Storm Cloud on AT&T' HorizonBut that' not all. Alphabet and Facebook now are look to compet with the core busi of telecom provid such as AT&T. Alphabet'sProject Fi, in collabor withSprint Corp(NYSE:S) andT-Mobil US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), will free user from sign a contract with a singl network. Thi allow user to switch between network depend on which one ha the best signal quality.8 of the Most Overr Stock on Wall Street Right NowAnd that' not all. Alphabet ha more projects, includingProject LoonandGoogl Fiber, in the works. These also threaten telecom like AT&T. And Facebook is do likewise, withFre Basics,Express Wi-Fiand theAquiladron project.Whi are tech compani like Alphabet and Facebook do this? Whi don't they just stick to their core businesses, search and social networks?Well, Alphabet and Facebook deriv most of their revenu from advertising. More peopl receiv access to the internet mean more peopl view ads, and more revenu for Alphabet and Facebook' core businesses. If peopl can't access the internet, they can't bring the two compani revenue.Alphabet and Facebook want to see more peopl use the internet, and if thi mean use drone or balloon to bring access to remot regions, so be it. With greater avail of bandwidth, traffic on their websit will go up.So are Facebook and Alphabet threat to T stock? Well, yes, in some ways. But in other way they may help telecom like AT&T by pioneer open-sourc hardwar and software-defin networking. They have their own reason for do so, and thi could help AT&T by lower the cost of equip which AT&T uses.Facebook/Alphabet vs. T Stock: FriendsIn an articl I wrote inNovember, I discuss Facebook and Alphabet' effort to develop open-sourc network equipment. Currently, compani likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) make money by sell proprietari hardwar and softwar to telecom and internet provid like AT&T.Network equip ha been describ as a""black box,""wher hardwar and softwar are bundl togeth by the same vendor. Softwar from other compani might not run smoothli on one company' hardware. Compani like Cisco can earn high margin on these proprietari products. Rout equip ha not yet beencommoditizedlik other hardware, such as servers.But the develop ofsoftware-defin networkingandnetwork function virtualizationcould chang this. These trend involv use open-sourc softwar and hardwar instead of more expens proprietari versions. Telecom like AT&T can then save money by switch to cheaper, interchangeable""whit box""switch and routers.Alphabet and Facebook are take advantag of this, and make their own network equipment.Facebook develop it ownSDNswitch, theWedge, and open-sourc the Linux-bas softwar to go along with that, FBOSS. It made the design for the Wedgeavail to the publicthrough the Open Comput Project. Custom can order thi from contract manufacturers, which sell it at a low margin, cheaper than Cisco' products. Facebook also releas an open-sourcetransponderthrough theTelecom Infrastructur Project, which focus on network hardwar for telecoms.Facebook hope that releas these to the public will speed up innovation, which will in turn benefit Facebook, a major hardwar user.Similarly, Alphabet built it own massivesoftware-defin network.How doe thi benefit AT&T? Well, GOOG and FB are pioneer a technolog which promis to lower cost for T stock. Through itsDomain 2.0program, AT&T is take advantag of software-defin network and network function virtualization. Last year, AT&T announc it intent tovirtu 75% of it network by 2020. These technolog allow it to do more with less. They appear to bereduc capexat AT&T, which would boost free cash flow and rais T stock. It also expect SDN and NFV to save it money onoper costs.Facebook/Alphabet vs. AT&T: EnemiesBut GOOG and FB also may harm T stock by get into the telecom business.GOOG'sProject Ficonnect user to the network with the best signal at the moment, whether that' Wi-Fi or 4G LTE offer by T-Mobil and Sprint. Normally, mobil phone subscrib must go with one service: AT&T,Verizon Commun Inc(NYSE:VZ), or others. Thi could forc telecom oper to improv their signal qualiti in order to compete.Alphabet also offer Googl Fiber, a high-spe fiber optic servic avail in some select citi in the Unit States. AT&T must feel threaten by this; last year AT&T andComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA)su Nashvilleaft the cityvot to approveGoogl Fiber.Alphabet is also work on the previous mention Project Loon, an effort to deploy telecom equip in balloon 20km from the earth' surface. Sinc the equip in a balloon is higher off the ground than an LTE tower, it can provid a greater area with internet access.Facebook is do likewis with the Aquila drone, Facebook Express Wi-Fi and Facebook Free Basics. Free Basic bring internet access to200 million peoplein countri like Brazil and the Philippines.Impact on AT&TTh harm effect of Facebook and Alphabet on AT&T stock may be a bit overstated.Facebook ha express it intent towork togetherwith telecom to roll out 5G technology.Nick Foxof Alphabet ha state that Alphabet' intent is not to compet with telecom and put them out of business. Indeed, Alphabet is cooper withthre telecomsin Indonesia to test Project Loon.And Alphabet and Facebook may be do telecom like AT&T a favor by bear some of the risk in these ventures. Telecom are more conserv than Facebook and Alphabet and wouldn't want to bear these risk on their own. Telecom like AT&T may benefit from the more effici deploy of telecom equip via balloons, which cover a wider area than towers.Also, mani of these region the two are target are regionswithout much internet access.Facebook and Alphabet wouldn't be threaten AT&T by bring internet access to region in Africa, where T stock deriv littl if ani revenue.Could Amazon.com, Inc.

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announc slightli lower same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and investor dump BBi stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrTh drop wa minor, less than 1%. But it wa unexpected, and miss analyst estim of a top-lin gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy report earn of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenu of $13.48 billion. Thi compar with earn of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenu of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjust profit of $1.95 per share easili beat estim of $1.67, revenu fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.Th revenu shortfal meant analyst threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retail such asMacy' Inc.(NYSE:M), with share down almost 5% earli Wednesday, to $42.40. Dure the Christma season, on Dec. 8, the share trade as high as $49.31.Were the analyst right, or did they just offer smart investor a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is thi just a case of Moore' Law in action?Great Expect for Best BuyBest Buy even trounc the higher earn whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswer all over the map, with some veri bearish about the company' abil to cut cost and other bullish on margins.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The Zack Metric Model note that BBi stock had beaten estim for four quarters, and that sharehold had been reward with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy wa post big gain in onlin sale - the so-cal ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zack wa expect an upsid surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy deliv one. And consid the sizabl beat, BBi share should'v rocket higher.But someth els is at play … and that someth is Moore' Law.Moore' Law Hit the Top LineMoore' Law, which turn 50 in 2015, wa describ byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-found Gordon Moor as an expect increas in circuit densiti on silicon, doubl everi 18 month ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been write for mani year now, Moore' Law alsoturn tradit econom on it head. Moore' Law is deflationary, and the deflationari impact grow with time, as integr circuit are incorpor into more and more things, and as the impact is compound by it use in variou ways.In the case of Best Buy, thi mean the product it sell lose valu as soon as they leav the factory, and the retail is under enorm pressur to get them out the door befor their valu disappears. Thi isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company' primari growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unafford just a few year ago - 5 feet wide on the diagon - is now avail at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen set just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still make money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and thi is true for all consum electronics. Whole categori that use to repres big profits, like back-up drives, DVD player and packag software, have disappear as consum find they can get and save file to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBi StockTh new administr want to whip deflat now and, by allow price hike on oil and other resources, they could achiev the goal. China, too, seem dedic to fight deflation, give rais to mani worker in a more competit market.Thi should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focus more on product like oven and wash machin that have mechan part which sometim break. A new round of high-end phone should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earn multipl of under 14, and a dividend yield 2.5% (that the compani is in a great posit to raise), BBi stock might be Best Buy' best bargain.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

In fact, you could say Amazon would be take a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon' biggest rival in electron retail.How' that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you miss it, Amazon ha been slowli enter the apparel businesssinc debutingit own private-label brand in earli 2016 with 1,800 product avail for sale under name such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Societi New York.Essentially, it' tri to fill the gap not cover by it third-parti sellers. However, a bigger attract of do it own thing isn't lost on investor of AMZN stock, which is that you make more sell your own stuff than you do somebodi else's.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccord to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expect to pass Macy' in 2017 as America' top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.Whil it could do most of thi through it websites, have brick-and-mortar store ha alway been on the mind of analyst and retail expert alike.""W believ thi deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consum pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliv Chen in a recent report discuss the possibl of it buy Macy's. ""Amazon need better brands, a more curat assortment, a physic place to return items, and custom could use help with ensur fit - Macy' would also give Amazon greater credibl in curat and fashion authority.""That last part' a bit of stretch. I'm pretti sure if Amazon knock on your door and you'r a privat label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantag of it privat label expansion, real estat is go to becom an import part of the equat as AMZN expand into brick-and-mortar locations. It' not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abund of retail real estat come on stream through all the variou store close across America, including68 Macy' stores- part of the bigger 100 store close announc from last summer - in 2017, so find space isn't go to be a problem for AMZN.If you rememb what happen toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buy all those leas in one big deal ultim wa it undo becaus it put way too much pressur on it employe to execut such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it ha store across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decad or longer to execute. If it realli want to open retail store thi isn't an appropri solut for a growth compani like AMZN.Whi Best Buy?Busi wasn't look good for the Minneapolis-bas electron retail until CEO Hubert Joli turn the compani upsid down in 2012 implement it infam ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turn physic store locat into local distribut hub for it e-commerc business.Form CFO Sharon McCollamcal the ship-from-storein in Februari 2016 ""one of the most import and strateg decis in (Best Buy's) history.""Th number don't lie.

3 Lessons From Warren Buffett's Decision to Dump Wal-Mart;2/28/2017;"In 2005,Berkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) chief Warren Buffett began buy share ofWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE: WMT) .At the time, Wal-Mart seem to embodi mani of the qualiti Buffett look for in a stock. With it size and scale, Wal-Mart could certainli claim the ""econom moat"" that Buffett favors, as it had put mani independ retail out of busi dure it rampant expansion. After trade sideway for sever years, the stock wa as cheap as it had been in at least a decade. And the compani had shown it commit to sharehold as a Dividend Aristocrat, rais it dividend payout everi year for at least 25 years.Imag source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Indeed, the retail giant wa fli high back in 2005. Earn per share grew 11% that year, on a 3% increas in compar sale in the U.S., and it retail squar footag jump 14%, thank in part to an acquisit in Brazil.Fast-forward a decad and thing have changed. Wal-Mart' growth ha ground to a halt as it is besieg byAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) and other onlin retailers, and Buffett ha taken notice, dump nearli all of hi stake in Walli World last year. After sell much of it posit in prior quarters, Berkshir sold $900 million worth of Wal-Mart share in the fourth, more than 90% of it remain stake.A the chart below shows, the broad-marketS&P 500more than doubl the return of Wal-Mart dure the period when Buffett own the stock:WMTdata byYCharts.In other words, Wal-Mart wa a clear loser for the Oracl of Omaha. Let' look for a few takeaway from Buffett' lose bet on Wal-Mart.1. Sustain competit advantag can changeFor years, Buffett ha told investor that one of the most import factor he look for in a stock is a ""sustain competit advantage."" Thi can be anyth from a brand name to a distribut network to a strong reputation, but it give that busi an abil to charg higher price than competitors, and present a barrier to entri to rivals.For year Buffett ha favor big-brand stock such asCoca-ColaandKraft Heinz Company, so it' no surpris he invest in Wal-Mart. Not onli is the retail a big brand, but it size also gave it economi of scale that it competitor couldn't match. Today, the compani is still the world' largest by revenue.But some thing happen in the last ten year that undermin Wal-Mart' competit advantage. E-commerc compani like Amazon have increasingli taken sale from Wal-Mart as shop pattern shift to the internet. And to a lesser extent,Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) ha stolen Wal-Mart' banner as the low-pric operator.A the chart below shows, Amazon' revenu ha grown much faster than Wal-Mart's, and even Costco' growth ha doubl that of it larger rival:WMT Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.Today, it seem that Amazon and Costco have competit advantag over Wal-Mart.2. Leadership mattersThough Buffett prefer compani that are so strong they could be run by anyon -- he famous onc said even a ham sandwich could run Coke -- the differ between winner and loser in the stock market often come down to who' in charge.Sinc Buffett first bought Wal-Mart, the compani ha had three differ CEOs, and it strategi ha chang sever times. Though the compani recogn the opportun in e-commerc earli on, it wa slow to take advantag of it.Amazon' Jeff Bezo ha built hi busi around that opportunity, and the compani ha aggress expand to provid faster deliveri and add benefit to it Prime membership service. Buffett recogn Bezo last May, call him a ""genius"" and saying, ""We haven't seen mani businessmen like him."" That pronounc seem to foreshadow hi sell of Wal-Mart as he realiz it had been best by Bezo and Amazon.3. No one bat 1.000 in investingIt' been said about basebal that even the best player make out most of the time they step up to the plate. Invest is similar. Even the best pick plenti of losers.Wal-Mart is far from alon among Buffett' bad bets.IBMha significantli underperform the market sinc Berkshir began buy it a few year ago. Buffett ha also admit mistak on compani such asTesco PLCand Dexter Shoe Company.But part of Buffett' geniu is that Berkshir ha avoid the steep loss that plagu the market dure recessions: It' dure those period that hi compani ha most outperform the market. In the case of Wal-Mart, Buffett seem to recogn that circumst had chang sinc he first bought the stock in 2005. He still pocket a gain on the stock, just less than an index fund would have yielded.A evid of hi always-evolv approach to investing, in the recent quarter, Buffett bought share in a sector he had pan just a few year ago: airlines. That show that it' never too late to refin your invest philosophy.10 stock we like better than Berkshir Hathaway (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Partnerships With Telecom Service Providers Drive International Subscriber Growth For Netflix?;2/28/2017;"After it expand global in 2016, Netflix (NFLX) is work on sever initi to grow it intern subscribers. Accord to our estimates, the company' intern segment account for nearli 42% of it valuation, and we expect it intern subscrib to grow rapidli and reach 110 million by the end of our forecast period.Th compani is take sever step to achiev thi growth, and recentlyent into a partnershipwith Spark, a New Zealand-bas telecommun compani which will offer a free one-year Netflix subscript to subscrib sign up for a 24-month unlimit data, Spark broadband plan. Thi is Netflix' first such deal in New Zealand, and the compani might be look at sever such deal as it look at an aggress global growth strategy. As subscrib growth in the U.S. stagnat and the compani face intens competit from other player such as Amazon Prime Video, intern market can provid the next wave of growth for Netflix. A partnership with telecom compani can give Netflix access to a larg subscrib base, which can be convert into loyal user base on the strength of it programming. Netflix' deal with Spark come after New Zealand regulatorsblockedVodafone' attempt to merg it New Zealand segment with Sky Network Televis on the ground that it would impact the competit of the market. While Netflix' deal is differ from Vodafone' propos partnership,som expert believethat it is more benefici to Spark than to Netflix. Spark is lose broadband market share in the region, current stand at an all-tim low of around 42%. However, Netflix doe get access to Spark' larg subscrib base in a region where it is still tri to establish itself. The compani is also focus on local content to gain market share in the intern segment.makeArticleAd();Intern market hold strong growth potenti for Netflix, and while it intern segment is not profit yet, we expect it to break even later thi year and expect it contribut margin to grow steadili thereaft to reach nearli 41% by the end of our forecast period.Thi estim assum that the company' intern contribut margin will approach the domest margin by the end of our forecast period as the intern busi matures. However, if Netflix is not abl to achiev thi margin expansion, there could be a downsid to our price estimate.Netflix is focus on intern market to drive much of it growth go forward. We believ partnership with telecom provid is a good market strategi for the compani and could aid it growth in intern markets.Glob Larg Cap |U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Larg & Mid CapMor Trefi Research"
Walmart Launches Grocery Price War: Can It Take on Aldi?;2/28/2017;"WalmartWMT, America' largest retailer, is reportedli test a ""price-comparison test"" in as mani as 1,200 U.S. store in the hope of close the price gap between itself and top competitor like KrogerKRand popular German discount chain Aldi,accord toReuters, who cite sourc familiar with the matter.Walmart launch the test in 11 Midwest and Southeastern states, includ Iowa, Illinois, and Florida. The retailer's, whose groceri busi make up more than half of it total revenue, main goal is to find specif price point for specif products, adjust price on an as-need basi in order to get more custom into it brick-and-mortar stores.Apparently, Walmart met with some of it biggest vendor last week, like ConagraCAG, Procter & GamblePG, and UnileverUL, and demand they cut what the charg the retail by 15%, saysReuters' sources. They also said that Walmart expect it supplier to help it edg out it rival on ""head-to-head price 80% of the time.""Th Aldi WayAldi ha been a part of the American groceri landscap sinc it open it first U.S. store in 1976. It now oper around 1,600 store stateside, under both the Aldi and popular Trader Joe' banners. Aldi is known for it incred low prices, and the discount grocer keep price low by do a number of things.90% of it store product are Aldi-exclus brands, which allow the compani to provid high-qual item without the hidden cost that come with advertis and market nation name brands. Staf level are kept low, and custom end up do task normal done by store employee, like bring their own bag and bag their own groceries. Thi save Aldi a ton of money.Aldi also ha product arriv at it store in box that have one side missing, so that they can be put onto a shelf without have to be unpacked, and which save the compani the money of have to pay someon to stock shelves. There' also a 25-cent deposit to use a shop cart, allow Aldi to not have to hire anyon to polic and round-up carts.In addit to Aldi' $3 billion 5-year expans plan that will add more than 650 new locat by 2018, itstop German competitor, Lidl, ha plan to open it first store in the U.S. thi summer. Aldi and Lidl run veri similar, no-frills, discount groceri shop experiences, and together, they pose a seriou threat to Walmart' groceri business.Walmart Wage WarIn addit to Aldi and Lidl, Walmart face heat price competit from Kroger, Publix Super MarketsPUSH, and let' not dismiss AmazonAMZN, especi with the rise of onlin groceri delivery.Accord toReuters' numer spot checks, where the news public test Walmart' price against Aldi' in five of the 11 cities, ""Walmart' price for a basket of 15 stapl averag 8% less than Aldi' products,"" and in some cases, were as much as 10% less than at Aldi.Reuterstest product like private-label milk and butter and even brand item like Crest toothpast and a two-lit bottl of Coca-ColaKO.Now, to be abl to sell product that much cheaper than Aldi is pretti impressive. Aldi shopper like myself can attest to that fact. Whenev I go in to a store, which is usual about onc or twice a month to stock up on pantri item and other groceri essentials, I alway leav a littl surpris by how cheap my bill was. Like, should I go back and give them more money? It' a great feeling, especi in comparison to the feel I get when leav Whole FoodsWFM.But the real question for Walmart will be how they can maintain these extrem low groceri price without hurt it bottom line. Aldi and Lidl have alreadi work it into their clever busi models, but Walmart is much more than just a groceri store.

I call it Amazon-phobia, an irrat fear ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Krog Isn't Just KrogerDon't get me wrong. I love Amazon. I own the stock, I am a Prime member. There are some thing I'll never go out for again, like book and music. (Sorry, Barn & Noble.)8 of the Most Overr Stock on Wall Street Right NowBut there are also thing it' just easier to go out and get rather than wait for them to come to you. Food is one of those things, especi fresh food. Milk, tortillas, ice cream, beer, gasolin - I am not get them from Amazon today, and probabl never will.Krog also ha a strategi for take on Amazon. It is cut cost in it low-end businesses, essenti good that are price sensitive, while quietli move upscale.Krog recent sign a master agreement with McLane Co., a unit ofBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), tostock most of it conveni stores.

Here's How Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio Changed in the Past Year;2/28/2017;"Recently,Berkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) , the conglomer led by famou investor Warren Buffett, provid it one-a-quart updat on the company' wide follow stock portfolio. And despit be famou for hi buy-and-hold invest style, Buffett and hi team did quit a bit of buy and sell stock in 2016. Here' what Berkshir is hold now, and what chang sinc last year.Here' what stock Berkshir Hathaway own nowBerkshir Hathaway ha about 45 differ common stock in it portfolio, but mani of them are rel small investments. The portfolio is rather top-heavy, mean the bulk of the portfolio' valu is invest in just a hand of stocks.Imag Source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();A of Dec. 31, 2016, here are Berkshire' 15 largest common stock invest and their respect values.RankingCompanyNumb of Shares% StakeValue1Wel Fargo500,000,00010%$27.6 billion2Coca-Cola400,000,0009.3%$16.6 billion3IBM81,232,3038.5%$13.5 billion4American Express151,610,70016.8%$11.2 billion5Apple61,242,6521.1%$7.1 billion6Phillip 6674,587,89214.4%$6.4 billion7U.S. Bancorp101,859,3356%$5.2 billion8Goldman Sachs11,390,5822.9%$2.7 billion9Delta Airlines54,934,7187.5%$2.7 billion10Moody's24,669,77812.9%$2.3 billion11Southwest Airlines43,203,7757%$2.2 billion12Chart Communications6,789,0542.5%$2.0 billion13Unit Continental26,620,1848.4%$1.9 billion14Sanofi22,169,9301.7%$1.8 billion15USG Corp.43,387,98029.7%$1.3 billionData source: Berkshir Hathaway 2016 annual report.In addit to these, there are two other stock posit to note. Berkshir ha a 26.7% stake inKraft Heinz, which is technic the company' largest common stock holding. However, sinc Berkshir is part of a control group, it use the ""equiti method"" of account and consid it differ from it other common stock investments.Also, Berkshir haswarrantsto buy 700 million share ofBank of Americaat ani time befor Septemb 2021. If Berkshir decid to exercis it warrant (which it ha indic it intend to), thi invest would be worth approxim $16.8 billion.What' chang from last year?Of Berkshire' 15 largest investments, four are new to the list thi year:New addit to the top 15 -- Apple, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Unit Continental.Stock Berkshir sold --Deer & Company,AT&T,Proct & Gamble,Wal-Mart.Th addit of a larg Appl stake wa not a big surpris to mani investors, myself included. Appl ha a lot of qualiti Buffett love to see, such as a domin market position, price power, and a massiv stockpil of cash. Furthermore, for most of the year, Appl wa trade for an extrem cheap valuation, especi after back it cash out of the equation.Th airlin were more of a surprise. Buffett ha been highli neg on airlin stock ever sinc he made an ill-fat invest inU Airwaysin 1989. In 2007, Buffett said: ""The worst sort of busi is one that grow rapidly, requir signific capit to engend the growth, then earn littl or no money. Think airlines.""There' no way to know for sure whi Buffett and compani bought ani of these stock -- as a rule, Buffett doesn't discuss Berkshir investments. However, accord to reports, it wa a present fromAmerican AirlinesCEO Doug Parker that had a lot to do with Buffett' chang of heart.A far as the four stock that are no longer on the list, the same thing appli -- we just don't know for sure, but in mani cases, it' easi to get a good idea of why. For example, I'vewrittenabout how Buffett may have decid to dump hi AT&T share becaus Berkshir never bought them in the first place. Instead, they were inherit when AT&T acquir DirecTV, a Buffett stock. In Wal-Mart' case, to name anoth example, Buffett may have origin like Wal-Mart' competit advantages, but in recent years, e-commerc site such asAmazon.comhav start to eat away at some of those advantages.Wil we see major chang in 2017?There' a good chanc that Berkshir will do some seriou buy and sell in 2017. For one thing, the company' $86 billion cash hoard is the largest it' ever been, and Buffett would love to put some of thi to work if he find the right opportunities.Also, with the new Republican administration, it' like that some thesis-alt chang will happen, such as tax reform, healthcar changes, and more, and Buffett will like react to these in hi invest strategy. After all, after Donald Trump wa elect president, Buffett said he quickli spent $12 billion on stock investments.Whil there is no way of know what move Berkshir might make thi year, I'd be surpris if 2017 doesn't prove to be an activ year for Warren Buffett and hi stock pickers.10 stock we like better than Berkshir HathawayWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Organ sale were down from the year-ago period, as were organ profits.It must also be nervou about the plight of the outdoor recreat market, as it sell it product through retail that includ Bass, Big Rock Sports, Cabela's, Dick's, Gander Mountain, REI, Sportsman' Warehouse, and Wal-Mart. Further consolid or failur will limit where it can sell it goods.Out of sight, out of mindBut as much of a challeng as it is to these outdoors-gear retailers, Wal-Mart' acquisit of Moosejaw is mostli seen as an effort to confront the threatAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) presents.

Here's How Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio Changed in the Past Year;2/28/2017;"Recently,Berkshir Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) , the conglomer led by famou investor Warren Buffett, provid it one-a-quart updat on the company' wide follow stock portfolio. And despit be famou for hi buy-and-hold invest style, Buffett and hi team did quit a bit of buy and sell stock in 2016. Here' what Berkshir is hold now, and what chang sinc last year.Here' what stock Berkshir Hathaway own nowBerkshir Hathaway ha about 45 differ common stock in it portfolio, but mani of them are rel small investments. The portfolio is rather top-heavy, mean the bulk of the portfolio' valu is invest in just a hand of stocks.Imag Source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();A of Dec. 31, 2016, here are Berkshire' 15 largest common stock invest and their respect values.RankingCompanyNumb of Shares% StakeValue1Wel Fargo500,000,00010%$27.6 billion2Coca-Cola400,000,0009.3%$16.6 billion3IBM81,232,3038.5%$13.5 billion4American Express151,610,70016.8%$11.2 billion5Apple61,242,6521.1%$7.1 billion6Phillip 6674,587,89214.4%$6.4 billion7U.S. Bancorp101,859,3356%$5.2 billion8Goldman Sachs11,390,5822.9%$2.7 billion9Delta Airlines54,934,7187.5%$2.7 billion10Moody's24,669,77812.9%$2.3 billion11Southwest Airlines43,203,7757%$2.2 billion12Chart Communications6,789,0542.5%$2.0 billion13Unit Continental26,620,1848.4%$1.9 billion14Sanofi22,169,9301.7%$1.8 billion15USG Corp.43,387,98029.7%$1.3 billionData source: Berkshir Hathaway 2016 annual report.In addit to these, there are two other stock posit to note. Berkshir ha a 26.7% stake inKraft Heinz, which is technic the company' largest common stock holding. However, sinc Berkshir is part of a control group, it use the ""equiti method"" of account and consid it differ from it other common stock investments.Also, Berkshir haswarrantsto buy 700 million share ofBank of Americaat ani time befor Septemb 2021. If Berkshir decid to exercis it warrant (which it ha indic it intend to), thi invest would be worth approxim $16.8 billion.What' chang from last year?Of Berkshire' 15 largest investments, four are new to the list thi year:New addit to the top 15 -- Apple, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Unit Continental.Stock Berkshir sold --Deer & Company,AT&T,Proct & Gamble,Wal-Mart.Th addit of a larg Appl stake wa not a big surpris to mani investors, myself included. Appl ha a lot of qualiti Buffett love to see, such as a domin market position, price power, and a massiv stockpil of cash. Furthermore, for most of the year, Appl wa trade for an extrem cheap valuation, especi after back it cash out of the equation.Th airlin were more of a surprise. Buffett ha been highli neg on airlin stock ever sinc he made an ill-fat invest inU Airwaysin 1989. In 2007, Buffett said: ""The worst sort of busi is one that grow rapidly, requir signific capit to engend the growth, then earn littl or no money. Think airlines.""There' no way to know for sure whi Buffett and compani bought ani of these stock -- as a rule, Buffett doesn't discuss Berkshir investments. However, accord to reports, it wa a present fromAmerican AirlinesCEO Doug Parker that had a lot to do with Buffett' chang of heart.A far as the four stock that are no longer on the list, the same thing appli -- we just don't know for sure, but in mani cases, it' easi to get a good idea of why. For example, I'vewrittenabout how Buffett may have decid to dump hi AT&T share becaus Berkshir never bought them in the first place. Instead, they were inherit when AT&T acquir DirecTV, a Buffett stock. In Wal-Mart' case, to name anoth example, Buffett may have origin like Wal-Mart' competit advantages, but in recent years, e-commerc site such asAmazon.comhav start to eat away at some of those advantages.Wil we see major chang in 2017?There' a good chanc that Berkshir will do some seriou buy and sell in 2017. For one thing, the company' $86 billion cash hoard is the largest it' ever been, and Buffett would love to put some of thi to work if he find the right opportunities.Also, with the new Republican administration, it' like that some thesis-alt chang will happen, such as tax reform, healthcar changes, and more, and Buffett will like react to these in hi invest strategy. After all, after Donald Trump wa elect president, Buffett said he quickli spent $12 billion on stock investments.Whil there is no way of know what move Berkshir might make thi year, I'd be surpris if 2017 doesn't prove to be an activ year for Warren Buffett and hi stock pickers.10 stock we like better than Berkshir HathawayWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should American Outdoor Brands Be Worried About This Little Wal-Mart Acquisition?;2/28/2017;"On the surface, the small $51 million acquisitionWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) just made to help bolster it e-commerc divis should be of littl concern toAmerican Outdoor Brands(NASDAQ: AOBC) , but a closer inspect suggest it could threaten the gunsmith' plan to branch further out into the outdoor recreat market.Although the $40 billion market give American Outdoor a big target to shoot at as it diversifi away from firearms, the purchas of Moosejaw by the retail giant indic it' may be a tougher slog to achiev it goal than perhap previous thought.Imag source: Moosejaw.makeArticleAd();Wid open spacesTh activ outdoor market is in a state of upheav at the moment, with Gander Mountain reportedli on the brink ofdeclar bankruptcy, troubledCabela'stri to get bought out by Bass Pro Shops, and other outdoor athletics-ori retail like the parent of Eastern Mountain Sports, Sport Chalet, and Sport Author actual go bankrupt. While the shakeout will leav a few, more financi fit retail in place, such as Bass andDick' Sport Goods, it show the specialti market is scrambl and struggling.American Outdoor Brand is also stumbl over the slowdown in firearm demand. While it ha been report record sale for sever year running, and when it report fiscal 2017 third quarter result earli next month it will probabl do so again, the anticip that gun buyer demand is set to fall off a cliff ha caus it stock to lose a third of it valu over the past six months.Branch off into the rug outdoor market by make sever acquisit of it own is seen as a smart and time transit for the gunmaker, where firearm sale still account for most of it revenue. But a retail landscap that' in turmoil and now a bigger, wide avail competitor make American Outdoor' effort all that more challenging.A crowd space in the great outdoorsMoosejaw wa found in 1992 and is perhap best known for it relationship with apparel brand such as The North Face, Patagonia, Marmot, and Arc'teryx, but it carri over 400 brand and also ha an extens collect of hiking, camping, and backpack gear that aim squar at the audienc American Outdoor Brand is go after.

Situat similarli to American Outdoor with a focu on outdoor recreat activ and shoot sports, Vista report it own third-quart result that saw organ sale fall 5% year over year forc it to engag in heavi promot activ just to support the sale effort and maintain it market share.Outdoor product account for 46% of Vista' total revenues, and though sale rose 24% from last year, that wa sole due to make the acquisit of Action Sport and Camp Chef. Organ sale were down from the year-ago period, as were organ profits.It must also be nervou about the plight of the outdoor recreat market, as it sell it product through retail that includ Bass, Big Rock Sports, Cabela's, Dick's, Gander Mountain, REI, Sportsman' Warehouse, and Wal-Mart. Further consolid or failur will limit where it can sell it goods.Out of sight, out of mindBut as much of a challeng as it is to these outdoors-gear retailers, Wal-Mart' acquisit of Moosejaw is mostli seen as an effort to confront the threatAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) presents. Have also purchas e-commerc retail Jet.com and then onlin footwear retail ShoeBuy, the retail king is bulk up it e-commerc efforts, and the earli result are pay off.Imag source: Moosejaw.In it just-releas fourth quarter earn report, Wal-Mart said U.S. e-commerc gross merchandis volum jump 36% from last year on the strength of it acquisitions, and analyst have prais the retailer' overal perform as the best it' record in sever years.In announc it latest purchase, Wal-Mart said, ""Moosejaw supplier that are interest in expand their consum reach will now have the opportun to serv more custom through Jet.com and our other e-commerc sites.""That show where American Outdoor and Vista need to bulk up their own effort to keep their rival at bay. It may be the two outdoors-gear retail don't even cross Wal-Mart' mind, but the outcom could be the same and it doesn't mean either can ignor the real threat from thi small rival' acquisition.10 stock we like better than American Outdoor Brand CorporationWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Surprising Big-Brand Stocks Billionaires Sold Heavily Last Quarter;2/27/2017;"We'r a littl more than a week remov from Valentine' Day, which for investor had a complet differ mean than ""amore"" thi year. Feb. 14, 2017 wa the deadlin for institut and hedg fund manag with more than $100 million in asset under manag to complet and turn in their Form 13F to the Secur and Exchang Commiss (SEC). Form 13F provid a portfolio snapshot of an institut firms' or hedg funds' hold as of the end of the previou quarter -- in thi case, Dec. 31.The releas of 13F is an anticip event on Wall Street becaus it give the averag investor insight into what the top money manag have been up to, investment-wise. Though there are obviou limit to what we can learn from a 13F - for example, the snapshot they provid is 45 day old - they can nonetheless clue Wall Street and investor in about stock and trend to watch.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Billionair sold off some big-brand stock in Q4Accord toS&P Global Market Intelligence'sHedg Fund Tracker, which track the trade of the top hedg funds, four compani individu saw aggreg sell in Q4 that equat to more than $800 million in market value. One of those four wasTh William Companies, a larg energi infrastructur player in the U.S. that saw $910 million in aggreg market valu selling, but it' not exactli one that would be refer to as a ""big-brand stock.""However, the remain three compani that billionair hedg fund manag surprisingli sold heavili dure the fourth quarter could rightli be call big-brand stocks.Amazon.comArgu one of the biggest surpris from the releas of 13F wa that e-commerc giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) wa the most heavili sold stock in Q4, with an aggreg of $1.022 billion of it share be evict from hedg fund portfolios, accord to S&P Global Market Intelligence' Hedg Fund Tracker.Som of you might be wonder whi on Earth some of the smartest money manag on the planet were sell the king of e-commerce? While we can't speak for the billionair themselves, a probabl reason is the weak seen in brick-and-mortar mall-bas retailers.Imag source: Getti Images.Th problem thatMacy's(NYSE: M) ha been face exemplifi the issu of retail broadly; it experienc a 2.1% declin in same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and ha announc it is lay off 10,000 employe and close approxim 100 stores. Hedg fund manag may have assum that the weak in mall-bas retail would carri over to e-commerc as well.Wer these billionair right to sell? The answer is no, consid that Amazon.com hit a fresh all-tim high on Wednesday. Base on the company' fourth-quart report, sale grew on a constant currenc basi by 24%, while oper cash flow increas by 38% to $16.4 billion. Amazon can seemingli do no wrong. It Prime program is keep it member close to the hip, and it grow push into content and high-margin cloud servic are provid ampl new channel for revenu and profits. Sell Amazon could prove a costli mistak for these hedge-fund managers.Anheuser-Busch InBevAnoth big-brand stock that wa exil from billionair hedg fund portfolio in Q4 wasAnheuser-Busch InBev(NYSE: BUD) . Accord to the Hedg Fund Tracker, $902 million worth of AB InBev stock wa sold last quarter.Whi did hedg fund manag run from ""America' beer"" dure the fourth quarter? The answer can be found in AB InBev' third-quart earn report. The compani wound up announc a 2% year-over-year declin in EBITDA, a 0.2% drop in global beer volume, and a $0.19 drop in year-over-year EPS. The culprit? Accord to AB InBev, blame Brazil, which ha been deal with commodity-bas hiccup and high level of inflation. Billionair who sold AB InBev in Q4 clearli expect the company' struggl to last longer than one quarter.Imag source: Getti Images.However, if investor look beyond Brazil, which shouldn't be difficult consid that AB InBev is a global brand, they'll see a compani with potenti bubbl long-term prospects. For instance, the company' premium brand beer are gain market share, which is improv it revenu mix and help to counterbal some of the weak in Bud Light sales.What' more, AB InBev ha been outperform it industri peer in both China and Mexico. Organ growth in Q3 total nearli 10% in Mexico, with EBITDA growth of 5.8%. EBITDA margin were lower by 2.6%, but that' understand given it commerci invest in the region.Most importantly, the recent complet acquisit of SABMil give AB InBev even greater advantag of scale in the beer business, which should ultim improv it margin and open new doors. SABMiller' busi Colombia, Peru, and South African are except profitable, and further cement AB InBev' geograph reach.AB InBev isn't a scream valu stock after it subpar Q3 report thi past fall, but it' a stock that hedg fund may regret part way with over the long run.Teva Pharmaceut IndustriesLastly, it wa a bit of a shock to continu to see billionair money manag pour out ofTeva Pharmaceut Industries(NYSE: TEVA) dure Q4. Accord to the Hedg Fund Tracker, $875 million worth of Teva share were sold off by hedg funds. While Teva doesn't have the same brand-nam influenc as say an Amazon or AB InBev, it' still the largest gener drugmak in the world, mean it' certainli not chop liver among investors.So whi no love for Teva? It more than like boil down to two key issues.Imag source: Getti Images.First, Teva Pharmaceutical' lead brand drug, Copaxone, an inject treatment for multipl sclerosi that' respons for a good chunk of it profits, is set to face gener competition. Wall Street is clearli worri that Copaxone' lost sale could materi impact Teva' top and bottom lines.

E-commerc sale rose nearli 30%, which wa in good part due to it acquisit ofJet.com.Thi bring me to an import point regard the current battl in retail. While the shift from brick-and-mortar sale channel to onlin sale ha been an obviou if not outright brutal trend over the past decad and a half, I believ we have reach a certain matur in thi trend where the next big winner in thi game will have both a substanti onlin as well as a physic presence.To be sure, onlin retail giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) last year start take initi step into a brick-and-mortar presence, and last year' aforement acquisit of onlin retail Jet.com by WMT is an exampl of brick-and-mortar retail invest further in it onlin presence.Whil the introduct of drone packag deliveri and ever more effici and innov way of onlin order is an unstopp trend, a complet replac of physic sale point is nearli unthinkable. The margin winner in retail into the forese futur in my eye will come from a great cross sell strategi between onlin channel and physic locations.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightA such, what I like from Walmart' latest quarterli report wa the continu of invest into e-commerce.

None more ambiti - and unforeseen - than stick it Alexa person assist in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonThat move ha paid off with a big lead in the race to becom the hub of the smart home, despit AMZN' complet lack of smartphon presence.P a report inTh Information, Amazon is readi anoth bold move. If sourc are correct, AMZN is prepar to take onMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft Offic andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl G Suit with it own cloud-bas product suite.Report: Amazon.com Is Work on a Product SuiteTh Informationbrok the news that Amazon.com iswork on it own product suiteto take on Microsoft and Google. The websit say AMZN' Amazon Web Servic - AW - unit ha told some of it ""larg corpor customers"" of it plan to offer a new suit of product app that will compet against the two domin players.7 REIT That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Offic ha alway been consid a cash cow for the company. The product suit quickli becam the industri standard, the applic of choic for enterprise, school and home PC users. To make it softwar seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycl between major version of Microsoft Office, and to address the grow threat of Google' free Googl App suite, five year ago, the compani began push Offic 365.Thi subscript version of Microsoft Offic brought recur monthli revenu and other advantages. Microsoft expand into Offic app for mobil devic likeAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell onlin storag for Offic 365 users, with OneDrive.Googl Apps/G SuiteGoogl wasn't sit still, though, refin Googl App intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Offic 365, with paid monthli subscript plan and onlin storag options. The compani ha also leverag Googl App and it lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebook - ultra-low-cost laptop that have been give Microsoft fits, especi in the educ market.That educ market is where the potenti for disrupt is realli play out. With it free Googl App and low-cost Chromebooks, Googl upend the educ market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all devic in U.S. classroom were Chromebooks. Thi ha repercuss beyond the classroom, as those student turn into young profession who are more comfort with Google' product softwar than with Microsoft Office.I'v seen the effect first hand. My kid do everyth at school use G Suite, despit Microsoft offer free Offic 365 subscript to student and comput lab full of Window PCs. They ignor Microsoft Offic and Apple' Pages/Numb on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suit for do homework.If Googl could quickli make wave in one of Microsoft' key strongholds, whi couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Whi Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThi is a key question. Take on the Googl and Appl in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sens becaus the smart speaker wa a Trojan horse. It offer a grow number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devic by voic command, or interact with onlin services.That rope consum into buy it. But Alexa is a voice-activ path to effortlessli order product directli from Amazon.com, and give an incent to buy other Amazon product and servic like Amazon Music Unlimit and Amazon Fire TV.Where' the win for AMZN in offer product software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Servicesdomin the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from thi divis is a big driver of Amazon' overal growth. Amazon alreadi ha the server in place and it ha sever of the compon need for a product suite, includ it WorkDoc and WorkMail app and the recent announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferenc software. Stitch these togeth with a few addit compon and Amazon could have it Microsoft Offic and Googl G Suit competitor.Googl charg $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Offic 365 ha sever tier option start at $5.99 per month.AMZN could charg a competit rate for it new offering, ad more subscription-bas revenu to it bottom line while take advantag of it exist cloud muscle. The base monthli fee could be supplement by charg for addit onlin storag for enterpris custom - someth it ha plenti of.Product softwar could also becom anoth free perk of Prime membership. Prime member that start use Amazon' product softwar could put pressur on their employ to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google' approach that see student graduat and look to their employ to provid G Suit access.Th Dow Jone Industri Averag Keep Rising, But a Correct Is ComingAMZN isn't comment andTh Information'ssourc say all of thi is still in the earli stages, but the move make sense. Amazon ha been aggress expand beyond it role as an onlin retailer, AW ha the infrastructur need to support the initiative, the compani ha been creep into enterpris softwar with app like WorkMail, and Googl prove that the Microsoft Offic behemoth isn't invulnerable.

Can Wal-Mart Compete With Amazon and Make Money?;2/27/2017;"Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ha gotten aggress in it battl withAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) for digit sales. The compani ha massiv increas the number of product it sell onlin while also invest heavili in improv it abil to fulfil web or app order through it warehous and stores. In addition, the compani ha taken the bold step of drop it $50-a-year Amazon Prime-lik ShippingPass program, which gave custom unlimited, free two-day shipping.Instead, Wal-Mart now offer free two-day ship on everi order of at least $35, in some way one-up Amazon' $99-a-year Prime offer, which includ free, two-day ship among other perks.Thes are dare move led by the company' new head of digit oper Marc Lore, who came to Wal-Mart when it bought hi Jet.com start-up for $3.3 billion. The e-commerc boss ha preach the idea of Wal-Mart think like a start-up. By that Lore mean make bold move (like the free ship offer) as a way to wrest market share from a well-entrench competitor.makeArticleAd();That strategi can work, but it' veri expensive. Start-ups, includ Jet.com, and even Amazon as it ha grown, lose money as they fight to attain and keep customers. Wal-Mart ha decid to take that path, and it' a road fraught with peril.Wal-Mart now offer free ship on order over $35. Imag source: Wal-Mart.Wher doe Wal-Mart stand now?""W continu to invest in e-commerc to acceler growth,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillion dure the company' Q4 earn call, which wa transcrib bySeek Alpha(registr required). ""We'r gain traction and move faster. We'r the second-largest U.S. onlin retail by revenue, one of the top three onlin retail by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top three app in retail.""""Invest"" is the oper word in what McMillion said. Wal-Mart ha to spend heavili on infrastructur and it now ha to eat the cost of two-day ship on elig orders, which drive margin down.Th compani ha been grow it digit business. In Q4 U.S. e-commerc sale rose by 29% and McMillion said that ""Black Friday weekend sale mark the first time the number of peopl shop onlin surpass peopl shop in stores."" Those are impress feats, but it' also worth note that the compani saw it earn per share (EPS) drop from $1.43 in Q4 2015, to $1.22 in the same period of 2016.What hurdl doe Wal-Mart face?Th compani alreadi ha scale when it come to purchasing. That' a big hurdl for most new entrant in the digit space where Amazon ha an inher advantag in the fact that becaus it buy more, it pay better prices.Purchas price, however, is onli one piec of the digit puzzle. Wal-Mart spent billion buy Jet.com and in some way that' just the tip of the invest iceberg. Digit technolog move fast and Amazon ha never hesit to put it profit into it next innovation. Whether that' it warehous network, it fleet of airplanes, or even it wild idea like drone deliveri and mobil truck 3D-print order on demand, progress cost money.Pay for endless innov while also have to pay for free ship drive profit down. In addition, the easi abil for in-stor or onlin custom to price check against Amazon could also forc some price lower.Not all of Amazon' revenu is from retail sales, but it growth ha been incredible. Chart source:YCharts.com.Can Wal-Mart make money online?Wal-Mart ha the money to be in it for the long haul and sinc buy Jet.com and put Lore in charg of it digit business, it seem to have the right people. Grow e-commerce, however, is go to drive profit down, at least for a while. Jet.com, it should be noted, onc charg a $50 membership fee and while drop it did increas sale ""the strategi ha caus Jet.com to lose money on everi shipment, someth that would not have been revers for anoth five years,""Th New York Timesparaphras Lore as saying.Wal-Mart ha the scale, some of the infrastructure, and much stronger abil to negoti price lower with vendor than Jet.com did on it own. That like mean the compani won't lose money on it digit oper long-term or even short-term, but it' go to make less profit on each sale than it tradit ha in it stores.That' fine if the compani can continu to grow it sale volum as it did in Q4. Amazon ha essenti built a busi where it live on small margins, but make it up in volume. Wal-Mart should be abl to do the same and it ha to becaus custom are move toward digital.

3 Surprising Big-Brand Stocks Billionaires Sold Heavily Last Quarter;2/27/2017;"We'r a littl more than a week remov from Valentine' Day, which for investor had a complet differ mean than ""amore"" thi year.

Though there are obviou limit to what we can learn from a 13F - for example, the snapshot they provid is 45 day old - they can nonetheless clue Wall Street and investor in about stock and trend to watch.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Billionair sold off some big-brand stock in Q4Accord toS&P Global Market Intelligence'sHedg Fund Tracker, which track the trade of the top hedg funds, four compani individu saw aggreg sell in Q4 that equat to more than $800 million in market value. One of those four wasTh William Companies, a larg energi infrastructur player in the U.S. that saw $910 million in aggreg market valu selling, but it' not exactli one that would be refer to as a ""big-brand stock.""However, the remain three compani that billionair hedg fund manag surprisingli sold heavili dure the fourth quarter could rightli be call big-brand stocks.Amazon.comArgu one of the biggest surpris from the releas of 13F wa that e-commerc giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) wa the most heavili sold stock in Q4, with an aggreg of $1.022 billion of it share be evict from hedg fund portfolios, accord to S&P Global Market Intelligence' Hedg Fund Tracker.Som of you might be wonder whi on Earth some of the smartest money manag on the planet were sell the king of e-commerce? While we can't speak for the billionair themselves, a probabl reason is the weak seen in brick-and-mortar mall-bas retailers.Imag source: Getti Images.Th problem thatMacy's(NYSE: M) ha been face exemplifi the issu of retail broadly; it experienc a 2.1% declin in same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and ha announc it is lay off 10,000 employe and close approxim 100 stores. Hedg fund manag may have assum that the weak in mall-bas retail would carri over to e-commerc as well.Wer these billionair right to sell? The answer is no, consid that Amazon.com hit a fresh all-tim high on Wednesday. Base on the company' fourth-quart report, sale grew on a constant currenc basi by 24%, while oper cash flow increas by 38% to $16.4 billion. Amazon can seemingli do no wrong. It Prime program is keep it member close to the hip, and it grow push into content and high-margin cloud servic are provid ampl new channel for revenu and profits. Sell Amazon could prove a costli mistak for these hedge-fund managers.Anheuser-Busch InBevAnoth big-brand stock that wa exil from billionair hedg fund portfolio in Q4 wasAnheuser-Busch InBev(NYSE: BUD) . Accord to the Hedg Fund Tracker, $902 million worth of AB InBev stock wa sold last quarter.Whi did hedg fund manag run from ""America' beer"" dure the fourth quarter? The answer can be found in AB InBev' third-quart earn report. The compani wound up announc a 2% year-over-year declin in EBITDA, a 0.2% drop in global beer volume, and a $0.19 drop in year-over-year EPS. The culprit? Accord to AB InBev, blame Brazil, which ha been deal with commodity-bas hiccup and high level of inflation. Billionair who sold AB InBev in Q4 clearli expect the company' struggl to last longer than one quarter.Imag source: Getti Images.However, if investor look beyond Brazil, which shouldn't be difficult consid that AB InBev is a global brand, they'll see a compani with potenti bubbl long-term prospects. For instance, the company' premium brand beer are gain market share, which is improv it revenu mix and help to counterbal some of the weak in Bud Light sales.What' more, AB InBev ha been outperform it industri peer in both China and Mexico. Organ growth in Q3 total nearli 10% in Mexico, with EBITDA growth of 5.8%. EBITDA margin were lower by 2.6%, but that' understand given it commerci invest in the region.Most importantly, the recent complet acquisit of SABMil give AB InBev even greater advantag of scale in the beer business, which should ultim improv it margin and open new doors. SABMiller' busi Colombia, Peru, and South African are except profitable, and further cement AB InBev' geograph reach.AB InBev isn't a scream valu stock after it subpar Q3 report thi past fall, but it' a stock that hedg fund may regret part way with over the long run.Teva Pharmaceut IndustriesLastly, it wa a bit of a shock to continu to see billionair money manag pour out ofTeva Pharmaceut Industries(NYSE: TEVA) dure Q4. Accord to the Hedg Fund Tracker, $875 million worth of Teva share were sold off by hedg funds. While Teva doesn't have the same brand-nam influenc as say an Amazon or AB InBev, it' still the largest gener drugmak in the world, mean it' certainli not chop liver among investors.So whi no love for Teva? It more than like boil down to two key issues.Imag source: Getti Images.First, Teva Pharmaceutical' lead brand drug, Copaxone, an inject treatment for multipl sclerosi that' respons for a good chunk of it profits, is set to face gener competition. Wall Street is clearli worri that Copaxone' lost sale could materi impact Teva' top and bottom lines.

While the shift from brick-and-mortar sale channel to onlin sale ha been an obviou if not outright brutal trend over the past decad and a half, I believ we have reach a certain matur in thi trend where the next big winner in thi game will have both a substanti onlin as well as a physic presence.To be sure, onlin retail giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) last year start take initi step into a brick-and-mortar presence, and last year' aforement acquisit of onlin retail Jet.com by WMT is an exampl of brick-and-mortar retail invest further in it onlin presence.Whil the introduct of drone packag deliveri and ever more effici and innov way of onlin order is an unstopp trend, a complet replac of physic sale point is nearli unthinkable.

Why Amazon Wins on a Trump Border Tax;2/26/2017;"Retail CEO fromTarget,Best Buy(NYSE: BBY) ,Gap Incand other nation chain flock to the White Hous last week to meet with Presid Trump. At the top of the agenda wa a potenti border tax that the retail sector ha wide protested, as it would like forc a signific price increase.Not featur at the meet wasAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , the country' biggest e-commerc company, and the second-biggest retail by sale behindWal-Mart Stores, Inc,(NYSE: WMT) , which wa also absent.Imag Source: Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo ha spar with Trump in the past. Dure the campaign, Bezo promis Trump a seat on hi spaceship after then-candid Trump threaten Amazon becaus he did not like coverag of hi campaign inTh Washington Post, which Bezo own separ from Amazon. Sinc the election, the two have mend fences; Bezo congratul Trump on hi win, and wa one of sever tech CEO to meet with Trump at Trump Tower while he wa the President-elect.Oddli enough, despit Trump' former promis of ""such problems"" for Amazon, the e-commerc giant could be a big winner from the border tax as an indirect beneficiary.What is the border tax?Though ani tax on import is far from finalized, Trump made such a tariff a cornerston of hi campaign and ha continu to tout such a move as president. In hi first week in the White House, he suggest implement a 35% border tax on good from Mexico as a way to make our southern neighbor pay for the border wall, but walk the idea back after a backlash.Now Trump and Congression Republican appear to be consid a 20% border tax as a replac for tax revenu from a corpor tax cut and as an incent to encourag American manufacturing. It' part of a tax overhaul plan that could also allow repatri of foreign profit and let compani deduct the entireti of capit expens instead of depreci them gradually.It' no surpris that big-box retail chain would be oppos to such a tax, as mani of them reli on foreign-mad product for much of their inventory. Accord to an RBC Capit Market analysi publish inTh Wall Street Journal, as much as 85% of Best Buy' merchandis come from abroad. For Wal-Mart, that figur is around 35%. For both companies, such a border tax would significantli eat into profits, turn net incom neg in Best Buy' case, and would like lead to signific price increas at retail across the board.Whi Amazon benefitsThough it' often overlook in financi discuss of Amazon, about half of Amazon' sale come from third-parti vendor oper through it marketplace. In that sense, the compani is oper almost like a retail franchisor. Much likeMcDonald'sfranchis restaurants, Amazon use it website, brand name, technology, and infrastructur to leverag it retail platform for third-parti vendors, give it similar advantag to a compani like McDonald's. Franchis remov much of the risk of oper the underli business, as Amazon can collect sale commiss and oper fee and sell servic like Fulfil by Amazon, which handl storage, picking, packing, and ship for it third-parti vendors, without the risk and hassl of actual sell the merchandise.That marketplac system also mean that Amazon itself would be protect from a border tax on about half of the merchandis sold on it website. The burden would instead fall on those third-parti vendors, give Amazon a clear advantag over brick-and-mortar retail that do not have the luxuri of pass the buck in such a way.Furthermore, Amazon deriv about 37% of sale from outsid North America, which would not be subject to such a border tax, and it cloud-comput segment AWS, which gener billion in oper income, would also not be affected.Amazon ha also made a habit of tax avoid in the past -- the compani avoid charg sale tax for sever year throughout much of the U.S., and onli earlier thi month began collect sale tax in Arkansas.Though the compani didn't deliber plan for such a border tax, it stand to benefit over it brick-and-mortar rival in much the same way. At a time when tradit retail are struggl with a myriad challeng from e-commerc and shift shop patterns, a border tax could put a knife in the back of mani of Amazon' competitors. While it' still unclear if the tax will be implemented, such a tariff would onli be one more reason to bet on Amazon' continu growth as it expand it competit advantag over physic retailers.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

It' a compani that fuse an ageless disciplin like sale and market with state-of-the-art intellig algorithms. Instead of draft an advertis campaign and hope that it reson with potenti consumers, FUEL elimin the guess game. Their advanc and in-hous technolog activ seek andidentifi viabl markets.

But for a younger crowd, they can afford to give it the benefit of the doubt.Stock Pick for Millennials: Johnson Control Intern (JCI)Anytim I see an oil compani pitch in a stock pick for millenni story, I cringe. It' more than just a person grievance. I just find it to be a lazi idea. Crude oil isn't just old - it' a throwback to the late 19th century. For all the talk about millenni be hip and trendy, ad oil to the mix is like tri to explain the former popular of an eight-track disco album.Thi is whi I loveJohnson Control Intern Plc(NYSE:JCI).First, JCI is a San Diego-bas company. After lose our belov Chargers, it' my oblig to rais our city' profile.Mor importantli though, JCI is on the cut edg of technology.

JCI batteri produc significantli higher effici than their counterparts, and thi is onli the beginning.A more industri make the switch to cleaner energy, JCI will becom one of the elit provid of next-gen solutions. I'm realli dig the fact that Johnson Control ha a verydivers business, which includ ""cyber-smart"" build and energi storag systems. Thi is a compani with which millenni can grow.

It' not that I'm a particular fan of GBTC. What Iama fan of is bitcoin and the concept of open-sourc finance.At the risk of sound like an infomercial, bitcoin is the future. Think about thi - almost everi facet of our live ha been improv by technology. The Japanes take thi concept to awhol new level.

If you want to own TSLA stock, but want to wait for it to dip below $250, you could sell the March $250 put for $6.78, or $678 per contract, collect the premium, and wait for the share to pull back.If Tesla doesn't trade below $250, you still keep the premium and can roll your target out to the next contract month and tri again.

Investor shouldn't dismiss the deal simpli becaus the price doesn't seem high enough to matter.Alibaba Stock Need Intern GrowthAt the moment, Alibaba' busi still reli on Chines e-commerce. In the company' third quarter (end Dec. 31), China commerc gener 80% of revenue, with ~96% of that figur come from retail. Other businesses, includ cloud comput and entertainment, make up the other 20%. But, those busi remain unprofitable; Alibaba earn remain depend on Chines commerce. That' a bit of risk on it own, given concern about the Chines economy. Financi isn't consolid onto Alibaba' P&L, and at the moment, BABA ha a profit-shar agreement and could take up to one-third of Ant' equiti in an IPO. But, even that minor ownership mean Alibaba can use Ant Financi as an entranc into intern markets, and that' where Moneygram fit nicely.To begin, Ant can target Chines expatri in the U.S. and elsewhere. Ant alreadi ha joint ventur and partnership worldwide, and Moneygram further support it payment infrastructure. Plus, Alibaba' other offer such as e-commerce, entertain and even cloud services, can follow Ant' lead.At a valuat of nearli $250 billion, Alibaba stock probabl can't hold up on the Chines market alone, consid the sheer size of that market. There are too mani concern about the macro environ in that country. Internet and e-commerc penetr is increasing, but still low rel to develop countries. Everi step Alibaba take toward becom a legitim intern presenc - and a real competitor to Amazon - support the bull case for BABA stock.Th Moneygram purchas is actual a big step in that direction.Alibaba Isn't Just a RetailerIt' hard to imagin what Amazon.com might look like had the compani decid to be ""only"" an e-commerc retailer. It' almost certain that AMZN stock would trade well below it current level of approxim $840 per share.Alibaba ha certainli learn lesson from it American peer. It' move into cloud as well, where the companyha built a viabl businesswith worldwid aspirations. Now, Alibaba is look to Hollywood for growth.Further, the compani ha the infrastructur for a worldwid payment business, at a time when the futur of that industri is in seriou flux. That' a signific opportun for BABA stock, even for a compani the size of Alibaba's, and even with the compani own onli a portion of Ant Financial.Payp Hold Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth more than $50 billion. Combined,Visa Inc(NYSE:V),Mastercard Inc(NYSE:MA) andAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) are valu around $400 billion.7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Flush With CashThat' not to suggest that Ant is the next Visa, or even the next Paypal. But, Ant' effort in payment servic can move the needl for Alibaba stock, even given BABA' $250 billion valuation. Plus, Visa and Mastercard don't have the ad luxuri of use a payment servic platform to grow retail sales.Al told, I continu to believ that BABA stock is undervalued. I don't know that the Moneygram acquisit chang that dramat in the near term, but it highlight the potenti of the long-term strategi here. Own a Chines e-commerc retail might seem to have a lot risk at the moment, but Alibaba isn't just a Chines e-commerc retail anymor - and that' good news for BABA stock.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Enter Danger TerritoryAppl Inc.

Together, Nissan and BMW had combin sale of just under 8 million last year, which is half of what Ford and Volkswagen sold togeth last year. Alphabet' Googl Assistant, on the other hand, will driveFiat Chrysler Automobiles' UConnect infotain system; FCA' sale last year stood at 4.7 million units.Amazon, therefore, could be well on it way to provid the platform of choic for automakers.

Though the report didn't specifi a split between the sale for each device, it indic that Amazon Echo will domin the market, as it offer custom the option to shop directli from Amazon.com.It seem automak will choos to go with a platform that is gain the most accept among consumers. Explod sale of the Echo smart-hom devic indic that Amazon is deliv on thi front.How Alexa can get into older car as wellAlexa' market is not restrict to new cars, thank to third-parti accessories.

That' whi it usual carri a triple-digit price-to-earn ratio. When revenu slows, investor scrambl for the exit becaus there' not a big rainy-day fund of cash sit around at AMZN.But the amaz thing is, Amazon isn't like Babe Ruth - home run and strike out king - it' more like Ted Williams, one of the greatest hitter to everi play the game.T Williams' consist wa so stun that even Warren Buffett built hi trade philosophi aroundWilliams' bat philosophy. Basically, it' about find your sweet spot and then stick with it.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowBezo ha continu to innov and disrupt use the tool he ha around him.

And so, Amazon Web Servic wa born - and is one of the company' major growth engin in recent years.Bezo wa the first retail to talk about deliveri drones.

Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) In a Dividend Aristocrat Bubble?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn May 23, 1719, one of the greatest financi bubbl in the histori of the world kick off when the Compagni Perpetuel de Ind wa grant a monopoli by the French monarchi over all the trade right of all French coloni worldwide.makeArticleAd();Th company' stock price quickli soared, from 300 livr per share to more than 1,000 just a few month later. It wa quit a jump. But the enthusiasm continu for more than 18-months.In fact there wa such a frenzi to buy share that it wasn't uncommon for the stock price to doubl in a singl day. By November, share price had surpass 10,000.Base on modern-day calculations, a share price of 10,000 livr would have valu the compani at more than the entir GDP of Franc at the time.That would be likeAlphabet Inc(GOOGL) orAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) have a $20 TRILLION stock market capit today. Insane.A with all bubbl throughout history, that one burst as well… quickli and violently. Call it 'revers to the mean'. Stein' Law. Or just plain old common sense.It' pretti simple- there are certain anomali that are too absurd to last. And natur alway find a way to correct them.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveWhil it' nowher near as extrem as the Compagni Perpetuel de Indes, the market today is also in a complet unsustain position.I'l show you what I mean-Tak a look atExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM); it' one of the largest compani in the world and a favorit among investor due to it 3.7% dividend yield.Quart after quarter, Exxon Mobil ha been pay dividend to it sharehold without fail for decades, even at the peak of the financi crisis.Not onli that, but the compani ha gener increas it dividend each year as well. To stock investors, that kind of consist is a gold mine. But there' a small problem.For the last sever years, Exxon ha been borrow money in order to maintain it dividend payments. Last month, for example, the compani report $26.4 billion in cashflow from it busi oper dure 2016.But in order to maintain the business, the compani had to spend $16.7 billion on what' known in financ as ""capit expenditures"" or ""capex"". Capex is critic to a big busi like Exxon Mobil; everi year they have to replac old machinery, purchas more land, etc.If they don't do these things, the busi will suffer and revenu will decline. So after subtract the capex, Exxon Mobil had $9.7 billion remain in ""free cash flow"".Not bad.Except that, accord to the company,they paid $12.5 billion in dividends.Hang on a sec. How is it possibl that the compani could pay $12.5 billion in dividend when they onli had $9.7 billion in free cash flow remain after the capex spending?Easy. They went into debt. Exxon borrow billion of dollar in order to pay it sharehold a healthi dividend. And they'v been do thi for years. Exxon Mobil is FAR from alone.Verizon Commun Inc.(VZ) is anoth shine example: in 2016, the compani earn $22.7 billion from it busi operations, but had $17.1 billion worth of capex. That left $5.6 billion remaining. Yet Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividends.Onc again, the compani took on billion of dollar in addit debt.Thi ha been a major trend across the biggest compani in the market.There' noth wrong with debt; sometim it can be a smart move that creat valu for the company.Our manufactur busi in Australia recent took on some debt to buy some new equipment, for example. It' been a great decision; we'r abl to gener more revenu with less cost, so the overal growth in our profit is multipl greater than the interest payment.But borrow billion of dollar just to pay out what amount to sham dividend is a complet wast of money… and irresponsible.It also mean that these record high stock price are artificial, base on debt-fuel dividend and share buyback instead of healthi free cash flow.Thi is total unsustainable.In addition, with an averag P/E ratio of 26.5, stock valuat are at their highest level sinc the financi crisis; it' yet anoth layer of risk in thi market.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayFew peopl ever got rich buy what wa popular and expensive.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI'm a firm believ inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the markets, there is an elit group of compani that defin their respect industries. For example,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) own e-commerce, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha forev chang social media. And for now,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the king of smart devices. But in my humbl opinion, GOOGL stock top them all.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDon't get me wrong as thi is not a slight against ani of the abov companies. Just let me forward a veri basic observ - all these other name essenti requir the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet repres their core market message.But what happen when you own the internet? That' a theoret question to everyon except GOOGL.A I mention in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engin is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whop 300%. It just get wors as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it' just not even worth considering. In ani other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an invest in life itself. Mani peopl thought that thenam changeto Alphabet - a play on the financi term ""alpha"" and the gambl term ""bet"" - wa cheeki and a bit ridiculous. But it also signifi that Alphabet Inc could do whatev it want becaus no one can stop it. GOOGL stock wa essenti either an asset or a threat, depend on your perspective.Volatil Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matter most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't alway shown it best stuff. True, it' earli into 2017, and so far, it' up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up everi month and you'r guarante a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc ha also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlac contributor Chri Tyler point out. For example, GOOGL wa look at close Januari at over 6%. Instead, it onli secur 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowOn a strictli nomin basis, that' not much of a swing. But on percentag basis, it' a much differ story. It ha been well over a decad sinc Alphabet stock introduc itself to the markets. The crazi dynam involv in a fresh tech compani should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and it subsidiari are compar toGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) if GE wa a littl more hip.But with great size come great envy. Alphabet Inc now face a fundament problem.Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) want to reengag acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issu is the company' gener use of Oracle' Java softwar in order to design the Android oper system. GOOGL contend that use Java - which is open-sourc - is fair game. Oracl contend that it violat the ""fair use "" compon of copyright law.For those that acquir GOOGL stock, it' an ugli situat that might be a legitim risk. Here' the thing - whether it' legitim or not doesn't matter. If the market think it' a problem, it' a problem. That make the sight of what appear to be a bearish head-and-should pattern (between earli Decemb until now) a curiou development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it' not the best idea to buy an invest with baggage. Certainly, it' not a good idea when the baggag is from a giant compani like Oracle. Ditto that for it 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someon you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock ha some challenges.3 Struggl Stock That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it' a coincid that the head-and-should pattern is emerg right now. If I'm look at Alphabet Inc pure as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at thi juncture. I expect share to at least test it 50-day move average, which stand just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide toward it 200-day move average, which is around $763.Again, that' look at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technic as it is fundamentally. Asid from some bump in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoy clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bump have never affect Alphabet Inc in a perman way.Th bottom line here is that I would be content hold GOOGL stock. Further, ani dip are justifi buy opportunities, not mere contrarian for it own sake. Alphabet Inc isgo to $1,000- just tri to ignor the turbul as best you can.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Consum Stock That Will Knock Your Sock Off7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeTh postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappear first onInvestorPlace."
My Top 3 Stock Holdings;2/23/2017;"One of my favorit go-to metric when weigh stock is total address market (TAM), show the total market that may exist for a product or service.

I use the platform becaus I have rel and friend scatter across the countri and it is an easi way to keep track of the import moment in their lives: births, engagements, weddings, and the like. I also see opportun in it address market.In it most recent quarter, 98% of Facebook' revenu wa from advertising. The more user it has, the better the monetization. The compani current ha 1.86 billion monthli activ user (MAU). Tri to determin it address market involv a certain amount of subjectivity. We could use the entir world as it TAM, but that wouldn't be realistic. Currently, onli about 50% of the popul ha access to the internet, so that' a good start point. With an internet popul estim at 3.5 billion, Facebook could roughli doubl in size. It also ha addit growth driver in the WhatsApp messag app and the Instagram photo-shar platform. WhatsApp current ha 1.2 billion MAU and Instagram ha 600 million MAU while Facebook Messeng top 1 billion activ user last year.Whil thi isn't meant to provid anyth near exact figures, and the TAM is like lower, thi exercis clearli indic that Facebook still ha a formid runway.Help the world shopWorldwid e-commerc leaderAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is anoth compani that I like and use quit often.

Wal-Mart's E-Commerce Business Is Booming;2/22/2017;"Retail giantWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) report solid fourth-quart result on Tuesday, with the U.S. busi produc anoth quarter of comparable-sal growth. But the star of the show wa e-commerc as U.S. onlin sale soar 29% year-over-year, an acceler driven by the company' invest in thi busi as well as the acquisit of Jet.com. E-commerc is still small rel to the brick-and-mortar operations, but that won't remain true for long.What a differ a year makesAccord to the Depart of Commerce, total e-commerc sale in the U.S. rose 15.1% in 2016, far faster than the 2.9% growth in total retail sales. It wasn't too long ago that Wal-Mart' e-commerc busi wa underperform the broad market, lose share despit be well behind leaderAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Dure the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which end in Januari of last year, Wal-Mart' global e-commerc sale increas by just 8% on a constant currenc basis.Fisc 2017, however, wa a transform year. After a slow start, sale growth began to pick up dramatically. Global e-commerc sale were up 7% in the first quarter, 11.8% in the second, and 20.6% in the third. Wal-Mart switch to report U.S. e-commerc growth in it fourth-quart report, but it' clear that the compani is make progress.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Wal-Mart.Th compani made two major move last year that help drive thi growth. The first wa the continu rollout of onlin grocery, a servic that Wal-Mart aggress expand in 2016 after successful, region testing. The servic allow custom to place an order online, includ not onli groceri item but gener merchandis as well, and pick it up curbsid at a Wal-Mart store, free of charge. A deliveri option is also avail for a small fee.Thi onlin groceri servic is now avail in variou citi across 31 states. The compani is eventest out a concept conveni storethat allow custom to pick up order without the hassl of travel to a supercenter. With the groceri busi like to see rapid chang in the come years, driven in part by Amazon, Wal-Mart is aim to stay one step ahead of the competition.Th second major move wa buy start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet launch in 2015 with some notabl innovations, includ it ""smart cart"", which deliv save to custom base on how much they buy. Price start out low, often price-match competitor like Amazon, and then addit save are layer on top.Wal-Mart paid a signific premium for Jet.com, but the acquisit accomplish two things. First, it brought Jet.com CEO Marc Lore onboard as the head of Wal-Mart' entir e-commerc business. After year of e-commerc play second fiddl to Wal-Mart' brick-and-mortar operations, an aggress leader wa necessary.Second, Jet.com give Wal-Mart a brand that ha a better chanc of click with those who have no interest in shop at Wal-Mart itself. It' unclear whether the compani plan to keep the Jet.com brand aliv in the long run, but I think it would be a wise move.Th downsideAl of these invest in e-commerce, as well as those made in stores, have knock down Wal-Mart' bottom line. Adjust earn per share wa $4.32 in fiscal 2017, down from $4.59 in fiscal 2016. Wal-Mart guid for adjust earn between $4.20 and $4.40 per share thi year, roughli flat at the midpoint.There' no question that effect compet with Amazon will be expensive. Margin in the onlin busi will like be lower than those in the store business, so earn growth go forward will be sluggish at best. But the altern -- not compet at all -- isn't an option in a world where retail is shift online.Wal-Mart' recent move to offer free two-day ship on all order over $35 is anoth aggress step that will both hurt profit and provid a boost to e-commerc growth. The compani scrap it Amazon Prime-lik subscript program in favor of thi simpler strategy, and CEO Doug McMillon note in the confer call that the compani wa alreadi see an uptick in it e-commerc busi as a result.Wal-Mart is no longer sit idli by as Amazon scoop up an ever-grow share of retail sales. The compani made some big move last year that turbocharg it onlin efforts, and thi year is off to a strong start as well. The bottom line will like remain pressur as Wal-Mart aggress pursu thi opportunity, but the compani is do what need to be done to remain relevant.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon Prime Instant Video Is a Huge Loss Leader;2/22/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ha been more forthcom with inform about Amazon Prime recently. The biggest piec of inform Amazon disclos is that itsretail subscript servicesbrought in $6.4 billion last year. While that segment includ more than Amazon Prime, it certainli made it easier to estim how much money Prime bring in for Amazon.Dig further into Amazon' 10-K allow us to estim how much revenu from Prime subscript Amazon put toward ship revenue, and how much it put toward everyth els it offer through Prime (video, music, etc.). Estim for Amazon' spend on video and management' comment can help us piec togeth how Amazon view the econom of Prime Video.It should be no surpris that Prime Video is a loss leader.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Amazon.Let' do some mathFor 2016, Amazon report $6.39 billion in retail subscript servic revenue. About 90% of that revenue, $5.75 billion, came from Prime subscribers, accord to analyst estimates.Amazon also report net product sale of $94.67 billion for the year. Net product sale includ ""revenu from the sale of product and relat ship fees,"" accord to Amazon' 10-K. Amazon also report that retail product gener $91.43 billion for the year later in the 10-K, where it broke out subscript revenue. Retail product includ regular ship charges, but not subscript revenu from Amazon Prime. Those go toward the aforement retail subscript services.So, it look like $3.23 billion of ship revenu in ""net product sales"" came from Prime subscriptions. That leav around $2.52 billion in Prime subscript revenu for everyth else, includ Prime Video. (Keep in mind these are still just estim base on Prime account for 90% of subscript revenue.)$2.5 billion is significantli less than the $8.8 billionNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) gener last year. Still, Amazon is success compet against Netflix for content both origin and licensed.How much is Amazon spend on content?Amazon doesn't give exact detail on how much it spend on video content. Industri estim put the number at $3.2 billion for 2016, though. That impli Amazon is take at least a $700 million loss on Prime Video after account just for content costs. It also ha distribut and market expens for the product. For comparison, Netflix plan to spend $6 billion on content in 2017. It also spent nearli $1 billion on market last year.Amazon will certainli spend more on content thi year. It doubl it content spend and relat market expens in the second half of last year, and investor should expect spend to remain elev after it expand to 200 countriesat the end of last year.It' clear Amazon is take a signific loss on Prime Video, but it' easili subsid by the increas shop the averag Prime subscrib doe on Amazon.com. Prime ha fuel both Amazon' retail product sale and it third-parti seller service, which grew to $23 billion last year, up 44% year over year.What thi mean for stand-alon Prime VideoLast year, Amazon launch Prime Video globally, includ in market where it doesn't includ the ship benefit of Amazon Prime. Stand-alon Prime Video subscrib will pay $5.99 or 5.99 euro ($6.36) depend on their market. That repres a signific discount from the $99 annual fee ($8.25 per month) U.S. Prime subscrib pay. It' also less than the $9 per month for stand-alon Prime Video in the U.S.Th good news is that Amazon is current alloc less than half of Prime subscript revenu toward video. Last time I checked, $6 per month is more than half of the averag Prime subscript price. (Just double-checked. It' still more.)That mean Amazon' stand-alon product might repres a bargain compar to Netflix, but it doesn't mean Amazon is go to take a loss on it. It' just not nearli as profitable.

The Benefits Of Investing In Companies With A High Rate Of Discretionary Disclosure;2/22/2017;"ByStefano De Caterina:Corpor disclosur and shareholders' valu creationTh posit outcom of discretionari disclosur are variou and can benefit both compani and their shareholders. I will focu here on the benefit for the latter.Whilst the mandatori disclosur is impos by legisl or regul (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S. and the European Transpar Direct in the E.U.), the discretionari disclosur consist of ani addit inform a company' manag intend to provid the investor with.makeArticleAd();Most of the studi show that a disclosur increas creat valu for the shareholders. For instance, a studi conduct by Standard & Poor' show (see the chart below) that compani with higher transpar and disclosur (measur by the S&P transpar score) have a higher P/BV ratio.Source: Standard & Poor'sTh S&P transpar score take into account the quantiti of disclosure: the more inform is given (i.e. inform about ownership structur and shareholders' rights, inform about board and manag process, financi and oper information), the higher the score is. The same research also prove that firm with high disclosur and transpar have a lower market risk as show in the chart below:Source: Standard & Poor'sOth studi focus on event such as the introduct of regul (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) also verifi and confirm that disclosur either mandatori or discretionari creat valu for the shareholders.A crucial role in convey the disclosur to the investor is play by the Investor Relations.Th Nation Investor Relat Institut (NIRI) defin the Investor Relat as the:""Strateg manag respons that integr finance, communication, market and secur law complianc to enabl the most effect two-way commun between a company, the financi community, and other constituencies, which ultim contribut to a company' secur achiev fair valuation"".Bas on thi definition, we can assum that if a compani suppli it sharehold with a complete, timely, reliable, punctual and adequ flow of financi inform relat to it business, it will definit help investor make better invest decis and allow it stock price to align progress with it fair value.In thi sense, investor relat help share price to achiev a fair valuation. Valu gap between market valu and fair valu tend to diminish becaus investor believ manag can accomplish what it say through the disclosure(manag credibility).A flat or neg quarter will not be an automat sell signal becaus investor will seek for explan by the manag and, when convinc that fundament are still strong and growing, they will be more like to hold their share or even increas their posit becaus they trust the company' manag and, today more than ever, in the fallout of financi crisis, market run more on trust than money. As a matter of fact, the 2008 financi crisi and the ensu five year of econom turmoil clearli reveal the insuffici of disclosures, especi in the case of financi institutions.Mor transparencyFirst of all, make more financi inform avail mean more transpar for it investor who can make more appropri and accur invest decis base on a larger amount of data to evalu and compare.Voluntari disclosur decreas the investor' inform asymmetri to the extent of it usefulness. The degre of it use depend on it relevance, reliability, timeliness, and clarity.Moreover, the market tend to valu more compani present clear and easy-to-understand financi statement than those file complex and opaqu ones.Mani are the commun channel through which investor relat can convey the company' disclosur to the financi community. The main channel employ are the press releases, investor and analyst meetings, earn guidelines, investor presentations, and the Investor Relat page on the company' website.Investor are often concern not with past earnings, but rather with futur ones, thu the way a compani commun that financi inform through the commun channel mention abov might convinc or not the investor to buy it stocks.In addition, invest in busi which implement an effect voluntari disclosur polici mean invest into firm manag by credibl and reliabl managers; in other words, transpar lead to credibl and trust.Mor liquidityTh implement of an effect disclosur polici aim to reduc the inform asymmetri between manag and investor will entail a higher liquid of the share and increas the company' visibility, therebi attract more analyst to cover the stock and more institut investor to buy the company' share whose price will eventu go up with a clear and obviou advantag for all the investors.A more liquid stock also mean a reduc bid-off spread (the empir measur of market liquidity) for the investors, which mean a cheaper cost of trading. In conclusion, an effect disclosur polici reduc inform asymmetri and increas liquid in the equiti market.Low debtIncreas liquid also bring about a lower cost of capital, thu the compani will have to bear a smaller burden of debt, which is great news for the company' investors.Th major of studi have confirm that the cost of capit decreas as the company' risk percept dissip within the market and, as a consequence, the firm will be abl not onli to financ it invest at a lower cost, but also rais equiti capit more easily. Ultimately, disclosur facilit extern financing, investments, and growth, which will be eventu reflect in the rise of the stock price.Bi no surprise, the lead IT consult firm Infosi (INFY) rank among the three top compani for disclosur on it domest market (BSE100) ha approxim a 5.90% weight averag cost of capit vs. a 45.20% return on invest capital. In other word it can gener excess return on the invest 7.6 time more than it cost of capital. Besid that, Infosi can sport a 10-year track record of consist growth in sales, profits, free cash flow and dividends.Stock price appreci and lower volatilityFirm with high level of disclosur have a higher associ with stock price increas than those with low level of inform disclosure.A veri interest studi publish in the ""Financi Management"" journal compar an invest made in high-disclosur compani with an invest made in low-disclosur companies, and it show that the high-disclosur portfolio outperform the low-disclosur portfolio by an averag of 7% per year over a period of 14 years.Oth studi have prove that more transpar firm benefit from a reduct in the volatil of return which for the investor mean less risk and more stabl return over time.Th increas of liquid attract more institut investor who gener more volum and therefor push the stocks' price up. In addition, the increas of the analyst coverag and the set up of target price might also contribut in put further upward pressur on the stocks' price.Thestatu quoof disclosur and transpar in the corpor worldIn 2014 Transpar Intern ((TI)), the watchdog that monitor the intern corrupt among countri and corpor publish a rank of the top 10 most transpar compani and the least transpar firm in the world among the 124 largest publicly-list compani base on an index which take into account anti-corrupt program adopt by the rank compani and their overal organiz transparency. Seven of the top compani are from Europ while eight of the bottom 10 compani are from Asia.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)TI also publish a report whose find are veri interest but also surprising.In term of sectors, telecom and oil/ga compani lead the way whilst consum services, financial, tech and healthcar firm are the least transparent. Geographically, EU compani score highest in organiz transpar with an averag of 54% and U.S. firm score the lowest at 24%.U.S. tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Appl (NASDAQ:AAPL), Googl (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) all score less than three out of 10.Anoth American famou firm, Berkshir Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B), Warren Buffett' conglomerate, also had a bad performance, rank among the last 10.""Tech compani are drive chang that are make our societi more open and accountable. They should be set an exampl for other compani on transparency"" said Cobu de Swardt, TI' manag director.Th report also show the posit impact of strong legislation, with U.K. compani score 90% on averag compar to 20% in China.Accord to the report, financi sector compani still should be more transpar and account to the public if they want to win back public trust which is yet faltering.Th report urg multin compani to seek more transpar by disclos the subsidiari through which they oper in differ countri which are often imposs to trace. Obtain thi inform through a country-by-countri report is import sinc it would help peopl understand the impact of multin compani in their own country. In addition, through a full disclosur of corpor holdings, investor can gain more knowledg of financi flow such as intra-compani transfer and payment to governments.Whil all the evalu German compani disclos all their subsidiari abroad, no Chines compani disclos ani financi data in ani of the 59 foreign countri where they operate.In the country-by-countri disclosur ranking, more than 50 compani score an embarrass 0% and onli three perform abov the 50% level, the pre-tax profit be the least disclos financi inform while the revenu be the most disclosed. Amazon, Apple, Googl and IBM all fail to publish a full list of countri in which their subsidiari operate.Th watchdog in it report also highlight the import for the investor to be awar of the anti-corrupt polici establish by the compani they want to invest in sinc thi inform will help them evalu better the risk associ with the investment. U.K. compani perform best on anti-corrupt whilst Chines and Japanes compani are the poorest perform in both dimensions.In conclusion, invest in compani with a high rate of discretionari disclosur and transpar can dramat increas the overal shareholders' valu and substanti reduc the risk associ with the investment.Se alsoTh iShar MSCI Malaysia ETF Is A Specul Buyon seekingalpha.com"

3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years;2/22/2017;"Lockhe Martin(NYSE: LMT) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) make the short list of top stock with the kind of stay power necessari to reward investor for 50 year -- or longer! These big compani are industri titans, and they'v reward investor handsom in the past. Here' how they can keep deliv long-haul return in the future.Th biggest, longest revenu stream you'v ever heard ofRich Smith(Lockhe Martin):It' a truism on Wall Street that investor love ""visibility."" When you know in advanc how much revenu a compani is expect to take in over the next year, the next five years, and the next decad -- and when you can estim how much profit the compani will earn on that revenu -- it make it a whole lot easier to figur out how much the stock is worth, and whether it is safe to buy.IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.makeArticleAd();Th problem is that for most stocks, it' realli hard to figur out how well busi will go even one year into the future, much less five years. Ten years? That' practic unheard of. And yet, I happen to know of one compani offer revenu visibl for the next50 years.It name is Lockhe Martin.Nearli 10 year ago, I introduc investor to the incred profit potenti of Lockhe Martin' F-35 Lightn II fighter jet. Accord to then-Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Admir Mike Mullen, Lockheed' F-35 wa destin to be ""the last man fighter"" that the U.S. would ever build. What' more, the F-35 wa design to remain in servic through 2065 -- nearli 50 year into today' future.Ov that time, between money made build the plane and sell them to the U.S. militari and it alli around the world, money made servic the plane, and money made upgrad the F-35 to keep it modern and relev in a chang world, analyst estim that Lockhe Martin' F-35 will gener well in excess of $1 trillion in revenu for Lockheed. That' roughli $20 billion per year, orhalfth revenu Lockhe Martin book as recent as 2015. And if -- as Adm. Mullen predict -- the U.S. will never build anoth fighter to compet with Lockheed' F-35 franchise, then thi revenu stream should remain secur and unassail dure that entir 50-year time frame.Wil the predict come true? Maybe. Mayb not. One thing' for sure, though: The longer Lockhe Martin build F-35 fighter jet without competit -- be that 50 years, 40, or even just 10 -- the more Lockheed' competitors' skill in build compet fighter jet will wither, and the more domin Lockhe Martin will become.Th best is yet to comeTim Brugger(IBM):Sharehold are final reap reward for their patience. IBM stock ha soar 50% in the past 12 months, includ 9% thi year. The reason for investor optim is IBM' deliv on it strateg imperatives. Strateg imper are a group of segment focus on fast-grow markets, includ the cloud, big data analytics, cognit computing, mobile, and security.Collectively, strateg imper are perform ahead of CEO Ginni Rometty' goal of reach 40% of IBM' total sale by 2018. IBM end 2016 with $32.8 billion from the all-import units, equal to 41% of it $79.9 billion in total revenue.But it' not what IBM ha accomplish in the past year that warrant it spot on a list of stock to buy and hold. The market IBM' strateg imper target -- as big as they alreadi are -- have bare scratch the surfac of what the opportun represent.Th public cloud alon is expect to reach an estim $195 billion in 2020, and IBM is alreadi near the top of the provid heap, given it $13.7 billion in sale last year -- a 35% improv over 2015. Big data and secur are also expect to soar as the world becom digitized.IBM' long-term ace in the hole could prove to be it Watson artifici intellig (AI) comput wonder. With each pass day, IBM' Watson unit seem to announc yet anoth major ""win,"" be it in healthcare, data security, or even tax preparation. As great as the past year ha been for IBM, the best is yet to come.Thi big compani is onli get startedTodd Campbell(Amazon.com):I bet that with all the onlin shop you did thi past winter, you think that Amazon.com ha alreadi reach it full potential, but the realiti is thi e-commerc giant still ha plenti of room left to grow.Amazon.com is alreadi a go-to sourc for million of onlin shoppers, but accord to Censu Bureau data, e-commerc sale still onli repres a tini 8.4% of all retail sales. That' pretti amazing, especi when we consid that breakneck growth ha alreadi turn Amazon.com into a household name, with $136 billion in revenu last year.What might be even more impressive, however, is that while it get increasingli difficult to deliv double-digit growth rate as compani get bigger, Amazon.com' full-year sale still grew a whop 27% last year. Importantly, surg sale are get leverag against fix costs, and as a result, Amazon.com' profit is grow even more quickly. In 2016, manag report oper incom of $4.2 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 2015.Amazon.com' CEO, Jeff Bezo (who is perhap one of the best CEO in America), isn't about to take hi foot off the growth ga pedal, either.

Amazon vs. Wal-Mart: Which Has the Better Shipping Deal?;2/22/2017;"Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) made a bold move last month when it drop it annual membership that cost custom $49 a year for unlimited, free two-day shipping, instead offer that perk to anyon order $35 in elig items.Th retailer' previou program, ShippingPass, wa a blatant attempt to undercut the price ofAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime, the onlin retailer' incred success membership program. Prime began as a servic that offer free, two-day ship on million of item in exchang for an annual fee. Now a $99-a-year (or $10.99 a month) Prime membership come with all sort of perk beyond two-day ship includ Sunday deliveri in mani markets, the company' stream video and music services, earli access to some deals, and unlimit photo storage.Pow by the free ship offer, Prime grew to 65 million member in the Unit State enter Q4, 2016, accord to an analysi byConsum Intellig Research Partners(CIRP). Those member make up a littl over half of Amazon' audienc in the U.S. and they are incred import to the retail because, accord to CIRP, they spend an averag of about $1,200 per year, compar to about $600 per year for non-memb customers.makeArticleAd();Wal-Mart drop it membership program is both an admiss that it can't catch up to Prime and a bold attempt to win over customers. In theori the physic retailer' offer should be veri attract to anyon who is not a Prime member and the lack of a membership fee could get some peopl to consid drop Amazon' service.Wal-Mart' new program offer free ship on all elig offer over $35. Imag source: Wal-Mart.Compar Amazon and Wal-MartEven though Wal-Mart ha one-up Amazon by go fee-free, the two ship program are not identical. Prime may cost $99 a year while Wal-Mart doesn't charge, but it' not quit that simpl an equation. There are argument in favor of both compani even with the physic retailer' new price advantage.Th major differ -- and for some peopl it may be enough to make Prime worth it -- is that Amazon Prime cover ""over 50 million elig items,"" accord to itsweb page.Wal-Mart' free two-day ship offer onli cover ""more than two million items,"" the compani said in apress release.Th Wal-Mart program, which also let consum have their order ship to stores, focus ""on the item custom shop the most, includ household essenti such as babi necessities, pet products, food, like cereal and peanut butter, clean suppli and beauti favorites, as well as top electron and toys,"" the compani said. Amazon Prime offer all of those stapl as well as pretti much anyth els you can think of becaus the free two-day ship deal appli not just to item the compani sell directli to consum but also order it ship directli from it warehous sold by variou vendors.In addit Amazon offer free, though slower (5-8 day busi days) ship on ani order of book over $25 and ani overal order of $35 in elig items. That' veri slow delivery, but it might appeal to consum who want to buy someth they can't find in stores.Amazon use a mix of robot and peopl in it warehouses. Imag source: Amazon.Which compani ha the better ship deal?For consum who don't buy onlin veri often. Wal-Mart ha a veri compel offer. The retailer' free ship offer take away the risk of pay $99 for Prime and then find you don't use it veri often. In addition, while it offer onli a coupl of million items, the compani clearli know what consum buy and ha built it program around those items.Still, while Wal-Mart may win busi from non-Prim member and from peopl who let their membership laps due to lack of use, it' hard to see the averag Amazon devote who spend $1,200 a year opt to make a change. That' becaus Amazon' program cover so much more that use Prime becom a reflex for mani members. The differ between over 2 million item and over 50 million is massive, and like enough for Amazon to protect it turf, especi when you consid the other benefit Prime offers.For less-devot onlin shopper howev Wal-Mart ha a better deal. On a veri basic level free is simpli better than $99 a year, even if Amazon ha more items.Thi is an earli battl in what is like go to be a prolong war. Wal-Mart' offer should win it some custom and it may slow down Prime' growth. There are like to be more ship move made by both companies, but Wal-Mart ha shown that it' seriou about becom an onlin player. If it grow the elig item in it free ship program it could eventu erod the valu of Prime, at least for peopl who join mostli for free shipping.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Two top Wall Street analyst have lent their voic to the bullish sentiments.Thi articl seek to explor where equiti are actual head amidst the din of unend stream of analysi from differ comment on the wisdom/foolish of chase the rally.Whi are Investor Worri About Equities?If we were to go by the voic of 'reason' U.S. stock should have been struggl to stay afloat sinc Donald Trump won a surpris victori dure the 2016 election. Prior to the election, Wall Street had larg been worri about the potenti implic of a Trump presid for the stock market.Analyst were worri that a Trump presid could lead to an unpreced level of uncertainti in the global market.Interestingly, Trumpwon the electionand stock have been on a massiv ralli ever since. The chart below show how stock have fare sinc Trump won the elect last year until Wednesday Februari 15.The perform of U.S. equiti wa particularli bullish on Wednesday Februari 15. TheS&P 500mark 87 consecut session through which it didn't record a 1% declin - the index ha book a decent gain of 9.80% sinc Trump' victory.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveTheDow Jone Industri Averagei up 12.43% sinc Trump' victori and it ha cross the elus 20,000 mark.

The fact that stock are rise when Wall Street analyst had larg expect it to fall is enough reason to be worri that the ralli is too good to be true.In fact, someLionexo binari optionstrad have start call the current ralli the ""Icaru Rally"" becaus it is resplend of a Greek mythlog in which Icaru flew start fli higher and higher on a wing of wax until he flew too close to the sun.

Amazon Forced to Backtrack on Free Shipping Minimum;2/21/2017;"One year ago, nearli to the day,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) rais the free ship minimum order size for non-Prim custom to $49, up from $35. Thi increas not onli aim to keep a lid on Amazon' ship costs, which have been grow faster than revenu in recent quarters, but it also made Amazon Prime more attract on a rel basis.Amazon ha now, without ani sort of announcement, backtrack on that increase. The compani ha lower the free ship minimum back to $35, a boon for custom unwil to fork over the $99 annual fee for Amazon Prime. But thi move is unlik to be a simpl case of Amazon put the custom first. The e-commerc giant is begin to face a level of competit that it ha yet to experience, withWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) lead the charge.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Wal-Mart' big bet on free shippingWal-Mart spent two year test a Prime-lik servic of it own, but the compani recent scrap that idea and instead adopt a simpler strategy. Wal-Mart now offer free two-day ship on order over $35, with million of elig item and no fees. Thi match the polici of Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquir last year for $3.3 billion.Th time of Amazon' retreat, less than one month after Wal-Mart' shift in strategy, is unlik to be a coincidence. Wal-Mart' e-commerc busi is far smaller than that of Amazon's, but it growth ha reacceler in recent quarters. Global e-commerc sale grew by 20.6% year over year dure Wal-Mart' third quarter, up from just 7% growth dure the first quarter. The addit of Jet.com as well as major initi like onlin groceri have fuel the resurgence.With Jet.com CEO Marc Lore now in charg of Wal-Mart' e-commerc operation, it should be no surpris that the compani is get aggressive. For Wal-Mart free two-day ship on order over $35 will be expensive, but it make Amazon' non-Prim free ship offer look far less generous. Even with the lower $35 minimum, Amazon' free ship still promis deliveri in five to eight busi days.Thi move from Wal-Mart also make Prime appear less attractive, although Prime includ a long list of perk that have success kept subscrib on board so far, and it ha no minimum order size. Wal-Mart is bet that a $35 minimum is low enough to convinc shopper that the benefit of Prime don't justifi the cost.Imag source: Wal-Mart.Amazon still ha some major advantages. It select of product is far larger, with 50 million item elig for Prime, up 73% from 2015. Prime Now give subscrib free two-hour deliveri on a varieti of item in select cities. And Prime Video ha becom extens enough to pose a legitim threat to stream giantNetflix.But for shopper onli want the lowest price and fast free shipping, Amazon Prime ha lost some of it luster thank to Wal-Mart.How doe thi end?Amazon' strategi of continu make Prime more feature-pack ha work wonder so far. But as the gap between Prime' ship benefit and those offer for free by Amazon' competitor shrinks, one ha to wonder whether the compani can keep it up. While plenti of Prime member wouldn't dream of leav due to the ad benefit beyond free shipping, whether those perk will be enough in a world where free two-day ship is becom tabl stake is anyone' guess.Wal-Mart' move will undoubtedli forc other retail to make their own free ship offer more generous. And while Amazon' respons so far ha onli affect it non-Prim shipping, I won't be surpris if the compani ramp up it effort to make Prime appear like a better deal. A quicker roll-out of Prime Now, perhaps.On thing Amazon is unlik to do is make it non-Prim free ship much better.

Own Amazon Stock? Here's What You Need to Know About FedEx and UPS Earnings;2/21/2017;"What'sAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) plan with it deliveri and logist network? It' well known that the e-commerc compani is expand it deliveri servic -- but is it mere to complement the exist servic it get fromFedEx Corporation(NYSE: FDX) andUnit Parcel Service(NYSE: UPS) , or will Amazon end up directli compet with the packag deliveri giants? The question of the threat from Amazon come up on almost everi investor present given by FedEx and UPS.However, what' less discuss is that e-commerc growth is creat challeng for both companies. If Jeff Bezo think Amazon could compet with FedEx and UPS, the evid from their latest result suggest he might be in for a rude awakening. Here' why.E-commerc growth come at a priceIt' well known that servic e-commerc deliveri requir investment, but the amount of invest need ha surpris UP and FedEx in recent years. Consequently, both compani -- whose manag team have decad of experi between them -- have had to increas capit expenditur in order to servic growth.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti ImagesFor example, at it investor confer in Novemb 2014, UP predict that capit expenditur would be just 4.5%-5% of revenu in the 2015-2019 period. More than two year on, the realiti is significantli different. UPS' capit expenditur wa $2.965 billion in 2016, repres 4.8% of it report revenu of $60.9 billion -- but that' set to increas to more than 6% in 2017 in order to expand network capac for e-commerc deliveries. In addition, the tradit increas in U.S. domest packag profit from the third to fourth quarter hasbeen impactedbi the strain of e-commerc deliveri dure peak season.It' a similar stori at FedEx, where increas capit expenditur areimpact profitability. In reality, FedEx ha dealt better with the burgeon e-commerc growth than UP -- possibl becaus it oper separ air and ground networks, while UPS' integr network ha troubl deal with peak deliveri surg -- but on the flip side, it capit expenditur tend to be rel higher, and it return on invest capit tend to be lower than that of UPS.FDX CAPEX to Revenu (Annual)data byYCharts.A ll told, the warn is clear: If Amazon realli plan to compete, it could find itself make significantli higher capit expenditur than manag may want to make right now.Not all e-commerc deliveri are equalUP and FedEx are both face the issu of margin compress as e-commerc custom increasingli want the deliveri of less profit and ineffici pack items. A trampoline, for example, may be an ideal Christma present, but it' not a particularli profit one for deliveri companies. In addition, overs but rel light packag also put pressur on profitability. In response, UP and FedEx have hike price andtaken a raft of measur in order to influenc custom behavior.Th key point is that it' not just about chase e-commerc deliveri growth: It' about chasingprofitablee-commerc deliveri growth, someth Amazon might not find it so easi to do. In addition, UP and FedEx make money from deliveries, while Amazon also ha the goal of retain customers. In other words, make less profit deliveri might make sens to Amazon, so Bezo might find hi compani make increasingli less-profit deliveri in the futur -- particularli as UP and FedEx price such deliveri away from their networks.Oth retail might not want to use Amazon' networkFinally, Amazon is in direct competit with other e-commerc companies, and they may not want to use deliveri servic from Amazon as a consequence. If Bezo want the compani to becom a packag deliveri compani in it own right, it will have to build scale, and for that it would need to deliv for competitor -- even competitor from market Amazon enter in the future.Amazon isn't like to be a threatPut all of thi together, the evid from UP and FedEx suggest that new entrant into the market -- Amazon be the most like candid -- might find servic e-commerc growth to be problematic.In reality, Amazon' network expans plan are like to be more about tri to cut some ship cost and move it inventori around more efficiently. Thi doesn't mean the compani is a futur existenti threat to the incumb deliveri companies, but rather a custom look to build a complementari deliveri service.10 stock we like better than FedExWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Shoot 20% Higher;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt still amaz me that few investor actual understand howAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) make money. And that lack of insight suggest that BABA stock - despit alreadi outperform the market - remain consider undervalued. For reason I will discuss, Alibaba stock ha a clear shot to reach $120, net new all-tim highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen you mention retail and e-commerce, the nameAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) immedi come to mind. And while BABA is often refer to as ""China' Amazon,"" both compani - though they share some similar - also have glare differences.Notably, unlik Amazon, Alibaba doesn't store much of what it sells. Instead, BABA' main busi model, as it ""marketplace"" suggests, involv facilit busi transactions. It main goal is to bring consum togeth with million of small produc and retail around the world.How Alibaba Stock Set Itself ApartEssentially, Alibaba stock is closer to, say,eBay Inc(NASDAQ:EBAY) than Amazon. Yet, investor continu to make the mistak of worri about the BABA' profit margin as if they were significant. That is not to suggest that Alibaba' financi and cash flow aren't important, but to the extent that profit margin should determin the direct of BABA stock, it doesn't make sense. At least not until billionair chairman Jack Ma make margins, which have been all over the map, a key focus.What' more import to focu on is the manner in which users/consum are embrac the marketplac and the rate at which new small busi are join the company' market place. Specifically, Alibaba stock investor should ask whether can the compani continu to gener record revenu and how well can it diversifi the busi into fast-grow area such as the cloud? Keep in mind that thi is an area where Amazon andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), hold the No.1 and No.2 spot in market share, respectively.Th 10 Best Oil Stock to Buy Now for Big-Tim GainsBut BABA is on it' way to join the club.Alibaba' cloud platform Alicloud, which post a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue, ha becom a forc to be reckon with.

Not onli are BABA' pay custom grow at an impress rate, but the compani is also find way to get custom to pay more.Bottom Line for BABA StockAnalyst have yet to take Alicloud seriously, given that it account for onli about 5% of Alibaba' total revenue, but with the compani look to expand Alicloud beyond China, revenu growth will accelerate. And from a valuat perspective, BABA stock is price at just 23 time fiscal 2018 estim of $4.29 per share, which call for YOY earn growth of 23%.When appli a reason price-to-earn ratio of 28 to those estimates, I arriv at $120.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is the Perfect VALUE Play;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI love growth stock as much as the next guy, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorit at the moment. That' becaus GOOGL stock ha someth that a lot of other high-growth dynamo simpli don't have:makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockAni valu left whatsoever.I'm prudent when it come to hyper-growth stock such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). I'v miss out on some great run as a result, but I also haven't gotten burn when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focu on ""growth at a reason price,"" or GARP - and I believ GOOGL stock fall into thi category.Go With GARPWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earn ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x it earn growth rate, if earn are grow at 15% annual or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock ha a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depend on the earn growth rate.GOOGL stock trade at 29x FY16 earn and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analyst see five-year annual growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seem to qualifi as a GARP pick.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut there' even more good news.Thi doesn't consid the net cash posit of GOOGL stock. See, I valu a compani net of it net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch use to do. With $86.4 billion on it balanc sheet, that pull the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.On $19.5 billion in net incom for FY16, we suddenli find that Alphabet stock trade at 24.6 time FY16 earn and onli about 17.5 time FY17 earnings.That' the first step for me in even determin if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involv in.How Is Alphabet' Business?Th next thing I examin is how healthi Alphabet Inc' actual busi are.I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basic a giant digit advertis billboard with a ventur capit arm. However, I can't deni that Google' search enginehold an astonish 80.47% market share. As long as four out of everi five search are conduct on Google, advertis will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monument proportions, or some incred innov new method of searching, to chang thi significantly.Alphabet' 17% year-over-year increas in advertis revenu to $22.4 billion come as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantast Aggreg paid click up 36%, paid click on Googl properti up 43%, and paid click on Network properti up 7%. A lot of peopl freak out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the abov categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realiz that thi is becaus more advertis is be push to mobile.A for Other Bets, which is basic the company' VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollar in the quarter. But consid free cash flow wa $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL ha that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it take is one of these VC bet to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.Thi brief glanc tell me that Alphabet is an advertis busi with domin market share that is liter print money. I mean, it gener $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, mean it can do whatev it want with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat' even after spend about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continu to examin other part of the busi if I were look to includ GOOGLin someth like my forthcom stock advisori newsletter, The Liberti Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investor continu their own due dilig and strongli consid GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?;2/21/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recent introduc Chime, an enterpris collabor servic for onlin meetings, video conferencing, voic calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime' app work on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchron across all platform via Amazon Web Servic (AWS).Chim come in three version -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voic and video call and chat; Chime Plus, which add screen share and the integr of compani directories; and Chime Pro, which add tool for scheduling, hosting, recording, and person meet for up to 100 people.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Thes featur indic that Amazon is take aim at collabor tool likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rival alreadi too deepli entrench in the enterpris market for Amazon to disrupt? Let' take a closer look at Amazon' game plan to find out.Ent the crowd Saa marketAmazon' AWS, which ha an annual run rate of $14 billion, is the biggest cloud infrastructur platform in the world. It' sever time larger than it closest competitor, Microsoft' Azure. But while AW domin the cloud platform (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which host storag space, process power, and other tool for compani and develop -- it doesn't have a major presenc in the Saa (softwar as a service) market yet.Th Saa market is the crowded, consumer-fac side of the cloud, which includ servic like Microsoft' Offic 365, Dynam CRM, and Skype. The lion' share of Microsoft' commerci cloud revenu run rate of $14 billion is gener by those Saa product instead of Azure. Microsoft ha also been expand Skype' capabl as an enterpris collabor tool with Microsoft Teams, which enhanc Skype' cloud-bas commun featur and tightli integr the servic into Offic 365.Microsoft Teams. Imag source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, network giant Cisco aggress bundl softwar and secur product with it routers, switches, and unifi comput systems. Those bundl includ collabor tool like Spark, the cloud-bas platform for messages, meetings, and call it launch in late 2015. Last quarter, Cisco' collabor revenu rose 4% annual to $1.06 billion -- make it it third largest busi after it core busi of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the onli player in the crowd field of cloud-bas collabor tools.Alphabet' Googl ha been promot Hangout to enterpris custom over the past year,Boxha ad collabor tool on top of it cloud storag platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix' GoToMeet video conferenc platform for the same purposes. However, all these challeng notabl lack Microsoft and Cisco' clout in the enterpris market.That' whi Amazon believ it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also ha leverag -- the grow import of AW to enterpris customers. Amazon like believ that by offer Chime as an extens of AW (especi with it 30-day free trial) to it enterpris custom base, it can gain a foothold in the crowd ""unifi communication"" platform market.Amazon previous launch enterpris Saa product like WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever releas offici growth figur for those products. However, most industri watcher believ that those product are still dwarf by compar solut from Microsoft and Cisco. Thi strongli indic that AWS' domin of the PaaS/Iaa market doesn't guarante that Chime will becom a Skype or Spark killer anytim soon. Chime Pro also cost more than Skype for Busi -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plan to undercut it way into the market.Th key takeawayChim sound like a logic way for AW to straddl the PaaS/Iaa and Saa markets, but it' easier said than done. The market for cloud-bas unifi commun platform is incred crowded, and it' doubt that a new servic -- even one bundl with AW -- can claim a meaning slice of the market.

What To Expect From Wal-Mart's Q4 Results;2/20/2017;"Wal-Mart (WMT) is schedul to announc it fourth quarter result on Tuesday, Februari 21. The compani post mix result in the third quarter, as it bottom line beat analyst expect but revenu missed. The retail giant' net revenu increas 0.7% year over year (y-o-y)to $118 billion, while adjust earn of 98 cent per share were down 5% y-o-y, but well within the company' guidance. In Q3, the compani benefit from growth in the domest market due to it marketplac offer and benefit from Jet.com, partial offset by the neg impact of food deflat and foreign currenc fluctuations. We expect thi trend to continu into the fourth quarter as well.Wal-Mart also post three straight quarter of posit compar sale in fiscal 2017, which valid the company' invest in e-commerc and market initiatives. However, we expect it earn and cash flow to see some pressur due to these increas invest go forward. Wal-Mart is in the process of upgrad it 4,648 U.S. stores, and at the same time invest heavili in it e-commerc platform to counter the challeng pose by onlin retailers. In fact, Wal-Mart plan to invest more than $1 billion to improv it pre-exist store technolog and custom services. The company' capit expenditur are expect to be reach approximately$11 billionin fiscal 2018.makeArticleAd();Holiday SeasonExclud the gasolin station component, total retail and food servic sale for the 2016 holiday season were up 3.9% y-o-y, while holiday spend in non-stor retail jump 12.8% y-o-y. Thi signifi that the tradit retail have had a tough time, as e-commerc competitor captur a bigger share of the holiday sell season, which is veri import for retailers. So overall, we expect Wal-Mart to post mix holiday sale results, as it still still reli on store sales, which could be neg impact by the ongo custom shift from store to onlin shopping. Although Wal-Mart is invest heavili in it e-commerc initiatives, it will like take time for the company' onlin growth to have a signific impact on it overal results. In Q3 fiscal 2017, the company' onlin sale grew 20.6% y-o-y.Futur OutlookWal-Mart rais it full year adjust EP guidanc rang to between $4.20 to $4.35, up from $4.15 to $4.35 previously. It now expect it full-year effect tax rate to rang between 31% and 32%. For the upcom quarter, the compani expect compar sale growth for Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam' club (ex. fuel) to rang between 1.0% to 1.5%. Wal-Mart also expect adjust earn per share in the rang of $1.18 to $1.33 in the fourth quarter.

Is This the Next Industry Amazon Wants to Conquer?;2/19/2017;"Just day after announc it 2016 fourth-quart results,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) issu apress releasewith a bold headline: ""More than 33 Million Custom Have Use Amazon Payment to Make a Purchase."" The releas wa seemingli out of left field. In the confer call for the previou quarter -- held less than a week befor the press releas wa issu -- Amazon' manag fail to mention Amazon Payment even once.Imag source: Amazon.com, Inc.makeArticleAd();That' not to say the rare detail look Amazon manag gave us into the number wasn't impress -- it was. The releas gave plenti of updat stat on it Pay with Amazon service, a platform that allow shopper to make purchas from third-parti websit use the payment inform from their Amazon account. As the headlin proclaimed, more than 33 million custom have now use Pay with Amazon to make a purchase. The platform' payment volum doubl in 2016. Activ merchant accept Amazon Payment grew 120% year over year. More than 50% of the custom who use the platform were also Amazon Prime members.How doe Amazon Payment compare?Amazon Payment is the latest payment platform that allow custom to pay for onlin purchas from a number of differ websit use one account. It joinsPayP Hold Inc(NASDAQ: PYPL) andAppl Inc's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Appl Pay as other popular digit wallet with a built-in custom base.In Apple' 2017 fiscal first-quart confer call, CEO Tim Cook had some veri posit thing to say about Appl Pay. Among other things, Cook said that dure the past year the number of Appl Pay user had tripl and transact volum for the quarter wa up 500% year over year.Imag source: Visa Inc.Whil it' hard to make an apples-to-appl comparison (pardon the pun), PayPal is the unquest leader in thi space. In it most recent report quarter, PayPal had 197 million activ accounts, each averag a shade more than 31 transact per month. The company' total payment volum wa report at more than $99 billion, a 25% increas year over year.Th reason whi these number don't easili compar is becaus Appl and Amazon are still in the nascent stage of their effort and, as such, are work from much smaller bases. PayPal' activ account repres custom who are make regular purchas or transactions. In Amazon' press release, the trumpet 33 million custom were just custom who had use the platformonce, a far differ metric than custom who are regularli engag with the platform.Onlin merchant coverag -- the avail of a company' payment process servic -- is anoth arena where PayPal hold a big lead. In a Septemb 2016surveyconduct by PYMNTS.com, of the top 965 onlin merchants, 652, or roughli 68%, featur PayPal' ""Buy"" buttons. In second place wa Amazon, with 101 websit featur it button. No other compet payment servic wa featur on more than 10% of the websit surveyed. Sinc that wa the same month Appl Pay user could begin use it servic to make payment on the web, stat were not yet avail for it merchant coverage.Furthermore, while the percentag gain in users, transactions, and payment volum for both Appl Pay and Amazon Payment were certainli impressive, they were come off much smaller base than PayPal' much higher numbers. That doesn't mean these two compani might not overtak PayPal as the domin digit wallet one day, just that it is far too earli to make such a prediction.PayP is still the top dog -- for nowPayP still emerg as the top digit wallet among consumers. It base of almost 200 million activ account and impress onlin merchant coverag will be a tough moat to overcome, even by rival with such deep pocket as Amazon and Apple. Furthermore, PayPal show no sign of slow growth. The company' number of activ accounts, payment transactions, and total payment volum were all up by double-digit percentag in it most recent report quarter.Nor is PayPal rest on it laurels. Innov and popular new product like One Touch arepow mobil growthand it continu to increas market share in thegrow e-commerc movement.But none of that should take away what Amazon Payment and Appl Pay have the potenti to accomplish in thi space. Appl Pay ha legion of loyal iPhon users. Last quarter alone, Appl sold more than 78 million iPhones.Amazon ha a loyal base of about 63 million Amazon Prime members. Thi give it a lot of room for growth with custom who alreadi use their Amazon.com account for onlin purchases. Amazon' biggest challeng might be convinc more merchant to give them access to what their custom are buying. With all the data Amazon alreadi ha on digit spend trends, compet merchant might be reluct to give up more data to the onlin retail giant.At the end of the day, it is hard to recommend buy Amazon or Appl sole on their effort in payments. Both compani sport some of the largest market cap in the world and featur lot of move parts. But the impress growth their respect payment platform are see should not be overlooked, and should probabl be consid as yet anoth catalyst for both businesses.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Be readi to chang your busi model at the drop of a hat is a hallmark of great long-term investments, and Netflix ha thi qualiti in spades.What start as a simpl pay-per-rent DVD servic with a primit version of the icon red mailer soon becam a game-chang subscript servic instead. From there, Netflix move on to provid the first seriou digit video-stream busi -- includ as a freebi with the standard DVD-mail plans. Now the DVD and stream servic have separated, and Netflix ha move on to co-produc it own premium content.Thi will not be the last stop on Netflix' ever-chang busi model, either. I don't know what' next, but can't wait to find out.2. In fact, usuallyleadingthat changeWhen Netflix start that DVD-by-mail subscript service, it wa a complet novel idea. Blockbust tri to copi it but failed, destroy it own balanc sheet in the process. Retail giantWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) tri too, but end up just back out and sell it mail-ord subscrib list to Netflix.Th stream servic wa year ahead of similar plan from Hulu andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Netflix built that market from scratch, start as a freebi befor suffici broadband speed were broadli available.Likewise, Netflix dip it toe into high-qual content product with award-winn likeHous of CardsandOrang Is the New Blacklong befor Amazon and other stream rival start play the HBO game. Thi compani doesn't sit around and wait for market chang to just happen -- it lead the charg whenev possible.Sure, thi progress attitud add risk to Netflix' business. But those well-plan gambl have play out beauti so far, and I expect the win streak to continue. These guy know what they are doing.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Imag source: Netflix.3. Qualiti managementYeah,theseguys. CEO Reed Hast and content VP Ted Sarandos, just to name a few, have proven themselv to be top-shelf leaders. The servic platform they built have upend tradit entertain system more than once, and destroy mani would-b rival along the way.Hast is run hi busi like the train engin he is, base on high-qual data and a great sens for tomorrow' evolv technologies. Sarando add a data-driven human touch to the build of an attract content portfolio.4. ...own their mistakesNetflix make mistakes.Th most obviou exampl would be the ham-fistedQwiksterintroduct in 2011, split the stream servic out as a complet separ busi and rebrand the DVD servic you knew and love -- and charg a separ fee for each of these plans.That shocker went over like steak sauc on ice cream. Hast soonkil the Qwikster name, kept both of the separ servic under the proper Netflix umbrella, and apolog for the mess he made. The company' subscrib count and financi figur turn turbul for a while, befor settl back into massiv overal growth.Re Hast could definit have handl thi episod much better, but the final result wa pretti much exactli what he want all along. Did you know that the Netflix DVD servic now is known asDVD.com, manag through it namesak web address? The whole Qwikster plan ha actual work out, just a coupl of year late and under a differ name -- and larg out of the media spotlight.5. Grow quicklyTh U.S. stream segment is still ad plenti of new subscribers, to the tune of 4.7 million net new custom in 2016. But the far bigger growth stori today is found abroad. There, Netflix ad 14 million new subscrib last year while cover nearli the entir globe in stream services. The two divis are nearli the same size at the moment, but intern subscrib will soon outnumb the domest custom list.What' more, the oversea growth stori ha onli just begun and will have leg for year to come.Imag source: Netflix.6. ...at a crucial moment in timeAt the same time, the global market is onli just becom readi for seriou digit video servic like Netflix. Accord todata(link open PDF) from the Intern Telecommun Union, more than half of the world' popul is not yet use the internet -- but onlin access is explod in place like Africa, Latin America, and underdevelop part of Asia.Broadband access is still a rariti in Africa, reach less than 1% of the continent' popul today. Thank to increas invest in mobil broadband networks, a consortium of African commun minist hope to have broadband connect for 80% of the popul by the year 2020. That' more than 1 billion peopl becom potenti Netflix users, just a coupl of year from now.It' the perfect time for digit busi to set up shop worldwide, as Netflix did a year ago with Amazon Prime Video follow suit a few month later. If you build a great service, the oversea custom will come.7. One more thing -- and thi is importantNetflix critic often focu on the company' narrow bottom line. Net margin stop at 2.1% in 2016, a modest increas from 1.8% in 2015. Free cash flow are negative, and will remain so for the next coupl of years. Content licens can be expensive, especi on a global scale. In-hous product are even more costly, at least up front. As a result, Netflix plan to financ it oper mostli via rais new debt for the forese future. For mani investors, thi lack of capit is a deal-breaker.I would point out that debt is avail at histor low interest rate these days, and mani compani are sell bond or take out term loan for no other reason than to add leverag to their balanc sheet at attract rates. If there wa a perfect time to take out some fresh debt, thi would be it.Imag source: Netflix.Moreover, today' massiv cash expens are expect to turn into profit gener a few year down the line. Hit show such asStrang ThingsandTh Crownar expens to make, weigh down the cash flow sheet right now. Unlik third-parti content licenses, origin product cost can't be treat as amort cost over sever year -- it' all cash, right up front. But Netflix will still own them five year from now, enjoy a larg and grow subscrib base thank to yesteryear' premium content choic even as the product bill fade into distant memories.Y gotta pay money to make money. Here, the cash payoff will come five year from now, or mayb more.

The compani will report it quarterli number befor the market opens, with the consensu call for earn of $1.30 per share, on revenu of $130.97 billion. The stock ha risen a modest 0.3% on the year.Techn AnalysisWMT wa recent trade at $68.87, down $6.32 from it 12-month high and $6.52 abov it 12-month low.

The stock receiv S&P Capit IQ' 5 STAR ""Strong Buy"" ranking.Analyst' ThoughtsWMT share have been trend higher over the last month, but in order for the stock to build on it recent gain the compani will need to show solid result for it fourth-quarter. Brick and mortar retail have been punish in recent year by grow e-commerc competition, most notabl from Amazon.com (AMZN), but Wal-Mart ha made big stride in recent year to improv it onlin business. The compani ha invest a lot of money in it onlin business, and Wall Street want to see ongo improv in the company' onlin business. Last quarter the compani report a 21 percent jump in onlin sales, much stronger growth than the 12 percent gain it enjoy the previou quarter. Wall Street will pay close attent to the how strongli onlin sale grew in the most recent quarter. In addit to the compani invest heavili in it e-commerc business, it ha also been invest a lot in it employees, with addit train and wage hikes, which most analyst agre is start to result in higher custom satisfaction, but the invest are hurt the company' bottom line in the short term. Earn are expect to fall by 5.9% thi year, befor remain rel flat in 2018. The earn declin ha been price into the stock, which now trade with a P/E of just 14.9, so as long as the compani is abl to post result at least in-lin with the consensu the stock should continu to make back some of it recent gains.Stock Onli TradeIf you'r look to establish a long stock posit in WMT, consid buy the stock under $69.00. Sell if it fall below $62.10 or take profit if it get to $79.25.Bullish TradeIf you want to set up a bullish hedg trade on WMT, consid an April 60/62.50 bull-put credit spread for a 20-cent credit. That' a potenti 8.7% return (50.4% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 9.0% to caus a problem.Bearish TradeIf you want to take a bearish stanc on DE at thi time, consid a June 75/77.50 bear-cal credit spread for a 30-cent credit. That' a potenti 13.6% return (41.8% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 9.3% to caus a problem.Cov Call TradeIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basi on a new position, you may want to consid an April $70.00 cover call.

The Best Investments for an IRA;2/18/2017;"An IRA is a fantast way to build long-term wealth, but it can be tricki know which stock or ETF are best to own in one. There are thousand of publicli trade compani and ETF to choos from, and they don't all deserv a spot in your portfolio. How do you separ the good from the bad? It can help to establish some ground rules. For example, are you a growth investor, incom investor, or valu investor? Or are you a littl bit of each? OurIRA centercan help you figur out what approach is best for you, and then, it' time to get down to pick investments. To help get you started, here' one growth, one income, and one valu invest I think you ought to consid buy in your IRA.Get in on growthIf your time horizon is 10 years, 20 years, or longer, invest in compani that are reshap big and grow industri can be savvy. Disrupt compani can deliv signific revenu and profit growth that can fuel market-b gains. For example,Alphabettransform how we search and use information,Pricelineturn the travel market insid out, andNetflixre-envis how we consum video entertainment. In each of these cases, investor savvi enough to tuck these stock into their IRA were reward with massiv returns: Sinc 2004, these three compani are up 745%, 6,879%, and 8,121%, respectively.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Whil ani one of those stock could still be worth buy in IRA today, I thinkAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) might be an even better bet. Amazon is reshap retail, and I think there' plenti of room left for sale to climb. Why? Because, accord to the Censu Bureau, e-commerc sale account for just 8.4% of total retail sales, and that' despit their grow 15% in the past year. I think e-commerc compani will continu chip away at tradit retail, and if I'm right, then perhap there' no compani better posit to benefit than Amazon. The company' alreadi the biggest e-commerc compani out there, and in 2016, Amazon' net sale increas 27% to $136 billion. That' pretti amaz growth for a compani it size, but it may onli be the tip of the iceberg. After all, Amazon' revenu is still onli one-third ofWal-Mart'srevenue.Amazon also manag data in the cloud for mani of the country' biggest companies, and it Amazon Prime servic is carv out an import presenc in entertainment. If you'r still not convinced, simpli consid that Amazon' virtual assist -- Alexa -- may onli hint at how Amazon think it can transform our live in the future.Dividend heroesHistorically, stock that pay dividend outperform their non-dividend pay peers, and becaus IRA are tax-advantaged, those dividend payment can compound over time and potenti boost your retir nest egg.A a refresher, tradit IRA are fund with pre-tax dollars, and dividend paid to investor on invest held in tradit IRA aren't tax until they'r withdrawn in retirement. Alternatively, a Roth IRA is fund with after-tax dollars, so dividend paid on invest held in them may never be subject to incom taxes, as long as you follow the rule regard withdrawals. Additionally, unlik tradit IRAs, investor don't have to make withdraw from a Roth IRA dure their lifetime, so owningdividend stocksin Roth IRA can realli make a lot of sense.If incom invest sound like your cup of tea, one way to go about own dividend-pay compani in your IRA is to buy theProshar S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat ETF(NYSEMKT: NOBL) . Thi ETF own about 50 mid- and large-s compani that have increas their dividend for at least 25 consecut years. If you buy thi ETF, you'll gain exposur to household name likeClorox,McDonald's, andWalgreen Boot Alliance. You'll also get exposur to mani lesser-known top dividend stock like steelmakerNucor, Inc.Buy a bargainWhen it come to buy valu stocks, I'm a fan of buy top-notch compani at fair prices. Thus, it may not be surpris that I think investor should own top-shelf healthcar stock in their IRA, likePfizer, Inc.(NYSE: PFE) .With over $50 billion in sale and about $15 billion in adjust incom annually, Pfizer is a world-class leader in drug develop and marketing, and sinc 76 million babi boomer are get older and live longer, the demograph argument for own Pfizer' share is compelling.Admittedly, drugmak have gotten a lot of bad press late becaus of their decis on drug prices, but that bad press mean investor can get thi top stock at a 12% discount to it price last summer. Importantly, becaus new drug and savvi acquisit are fuel growth, rise earn mean investor are onli pay about 12 time forward earn estim to buy Pfizer' shares.Pfizer' dividend is anoth reason whi thi stock could be a smart buy for an IRA. Last year, the compani return $12 billion to investor via share buyback and dividends, and in December, Pfizer' board of director declar a $0.32 first-quart dividend that' 7% higher than last year. With a healthi dividend yield of 3.93%, I think thi stock make a lot of sens for IRAs.10 stock we like better than PfizerWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Does Thinking About Your IRA Give You Heartburn? Let Us Help;2/17/2017;"An IRA is a fantast retir save tool, but mani American don't take advantag of it, and when they do, they fail to make the most of it. If you'r among them, don't worry. Here are some rule to help you build a bigger nest egg with an IRA.What are IRAs?A a refresher, you can get big tax benefit by save money for retir in a tradit IRA or a Roth IRA.In 2017, you can set asid up to $5,500 of your earn in either a tradit IRA or a Roth IRA or a combin of the two. If you'r 50 year old or older, then you can save up to $6,500 of your earn in an IRA.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.Tradit IRA can be fund with pre-tax money, which mean that money you put in now isn't tax at your current tax rate. Instead, that money, and ani futur gains, are tax when it withdrawn. Becaus of thi feature, tradit IRA can make sens if you think your incom tax rate in retir will belowerthan it is today.Alternatively, Roth IRA are fund with after-tax money, which mean you'r pay tax on your contribut now so that you can withdraw them -- and futur gain -- tax-fre in retirement. Becaus of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make sens if you expect your incom tax rate in retir to behigherthan it is today.Som import IRA withdraw rulesIn the case of a tradit IRA, if you don't wait until you'r at least 59.5 year old, the IR will charg you incom tax on ani money that you withdraw, plu a 10% penalty, unless you qualifi for an earli withdraw exempt (more on that in a minute).In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contribut tax-fre at ani age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA ha been establish for at least five years. However, ani gain that you withdraw prior to reach age 59.5 can be subject to incom tax and penalties.Both tradit IRA and Roth IRA do allow penalti free, earli withdraw in specif instances. A full list of these exempt can be foundhere, but the big one to know about includ purchas a first home (up to $10,000), or payingcolleg tuitionfor you, or an immedi relative, such as a spous or child. The rule for take advantag of these exempt can be quit complex, so make sure you consult a tax profession befor take ani earli withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want is a surpris at tax time!Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think you'll need to withdraw contribut five or more year from now, and you won't be 59.5 year old or qualifi for an earli withdraw exempt at that time.Navig the IRA incom capsIn order to qualifi for a tax deduct on a tradit IRA contribution, your modifi adjust gross incom ha to be below set limit if you, or your spouse, are cover by a retir plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribut to a Roth IRA, your modifi adjust gross incom need to be below set limit too.Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job at explain adjust incom limit for IRA'shere, but in short, if you'r singl and you are cover by a retir plan at work, you can take the full deduct on a tradit IRA contribut if your adjust incom is below $62,000 in 2017. You can qualifi for a partial deduct if your adjust incom is between $62,000 and $72,000.If you'r single, you can make a contribut to a Roth IRA as long as your adjust incom is less than $118,000. You can make a partial contribut if your adjust incom is between $118,000 and $133,000.If you'r marri file jointli and cover by a retir plan at work, then you can take a tax deduct on your tradit IRA contribution, as long as your adjust incom is below $99,000. A partial deduct is possibl if your adjust incom is between $99,000 and $119,000.If you'r not cover by a plan at work but your spous is, then you can make a tax deduct contribut to tradit IRA if your adjust incom is below $186,000 or a partial deduct if your adjust incom is between $186,000 and $196,000.If you'r marri file jointly, you can contribut to a Roth IRA as long as your adjust incom is below $184,000. A partial contribut can be made if your incom is between $184,000 and $194,000.If you think you'r close to these limit and you'r unsur of how to calcul your modifi adjust gross income, you can read up on the subjecthere.How to invest in an IRAOnc you'v contribut to an IRA, you'll need to pick some investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think care about your age, your health, and the number of year you have until you begin withdrawals.If you'r young, in good health, and have plenti of year to ride out the inevit recession, then an IRA that includ stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual fund can make sense. Usually, buy and hold stock and ETF for long period of time is cheaper than buy an activ manag mutual fund, so make sure that you balanc the potenti return, risk, and expens associ with these choices.Som investor may prefer own individu stock for the long term, such as disrupt growth compani likeAmazonorAlphabet. Other investor may prefer own an S&P 500 ETF that track the stock market' return more closely. If so, a low-cost S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is theVanguardS&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . It ha an annual expens ratio of just 0.05%.It may also pay off to own dividend-pay stock in an IRA. Becaus IRA offer tax advantages, dividend payment can compound over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potenti tax-free. Historically, dividend-pay stock have outperform non-dividend-pay stocks. However, the perform ofdividend stockstend to be lower dure period of rise interest rates, when they have to compet with bond for incom investors' attention.Overall, build a diversifi IRA that includ exposur to stock and stock ETF can provid financi secur in retirement. For example, if you'r 30, and you contribut $5,500 per year for 35 year and earn a hypothet 6% return per year, then you'll have a nest egg valu at $612,886 at age 65.

Should you sell those stock too?makeArticleAd();Bail on brick and mortarWarren Buffett ha been a longtim owner of Wal-Mart Stores, but he' been sell share in the retail giant sinc last spring, and in Q4, Berkshir Hathaway reduc it posit in Wal-Mart by 89% to 1.4 million shares.Imag source: Wal-Mart Stores.On reason Buffett may be sell Wal-Mart is becaus the compani ha been under fire from onlin retailers, and maintain market share against those retail ha been hard.Wal-Mart is nowher near as troubl as some other tradit retailers, but retail sale figures, and Wal-Mart' own financi suggest Wal-Mart' best day may be behind it. Accord to the U.S. Censu Bureau, e-commerc industri revenu jump 15.7% year over year in Q3, 2016, and it now repres 8.4% of total retail sales.Wal-Mart' most recent quarterli earn report from Novemb show investor just how tough it been to compet against onlin retail likeAmazon.com. In Wal-Mart' fiscal third quarter, it sale grew by an anem 0.7% to $118.2 billion, and through the first nine month of fiscal 2017, it sale also grew by just 0.7% to $355 billion. For perspective, consid that Amazon.com' net sale surg 27% to $136.0 billion in 2016. Base on that comparison alone, it' understand whi Buffett no longer want Wal-Mart to be one of hi biggest holdings.Farm for profitWarren Buffett wa bet that Deer & Co. could recaptur some of luster last year, and it seem the farm machineri maker live up to hi expectations.Deer & Co.' share came into 2016 trade in the $70's. But, after a big run up, they finish the year trade at over $100. With Deere' share ralli to all-tim highs, it appear Buffett decid not to push hi luck. In the third quarter, he sold 874,185 shares, and in the fourth quarter, he sold hi remain 21.1 million shares.It' anyone' guess if Warren Buffett will buy share in Deer & Co. again, but if he does, it' probabl not go to be for a while, unless of course, Deere' share sell-off, or farm incom climbs. In 2016, farm incom wa the lowest sinc the recession, and that caus Deere' net revenu to fall 8% to $26.6 billion.Deer & Co.' abil to turn a profit despit slow equip demand is impressive, but the outlook for 2017 doesn't provid a lot of convict to buy Deere' share at lofti levels. The USDA net farm incom forecast for thi year put it at the lowest level sinc 2002, and Deer is project that equip sale will dip by anoth 1% in 2017. Thus, Deer & Co. may be worth buy onli if share price retreat Until then, patienc is probabl best.Wrong numberVerizon may be the country' biggest wireless carrier, but that fact alon wasn't enough to keep Warren Buffett a shareholder. Berkshir Hathaway sold almost all of it stake in Verizon last quarter.W may never know exactli whi Buffett sour on Verizon, but sinc Buffett ha ownedVerizon sharessinc the middl of 2014, it' possible, depend on the exact time of hi buy and sells, that he wa abl to book a double-digit percentag profit on hi invest in Verizon, and if so, then that gain might have been enough to convinc him to sell into grow industri uncertainty.Last year, Verizon decid to buyYahoo!to merg it with it AOL business, but after a high-profil data breach, pressur ha mount for that deal to be renegoti to reflect damag to Yahoo!' brand. Rumor are that Yahoo! may agre to a $250 million haircut to appeas Verizon, but even at that lower price, it' not a given that thi deal will be a big win.Ad to Verizon' uncertainti is the fact that it might need to do more deal just to keep pace withAT&T. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, and thi week,Tim Warnersharehold approv AT&T' $85 billion acquisit offer. As competitor push deeper into video, Verizon could have to make it own big splash, and that could be costly. Depend on how costly, that could be enough to send investor to the sidelines.10 stock we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sorry, Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Not a Short!;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock isn't cheap, to be sure. Even with TWLO more than 50% off late Septemb highs, the stock still trade at over seven time the midpoint of it 2017 revenu guidance. And that multipl exclud the company' $300 million in cash. Meanwhile, the price-earn ratio for Twilio stock is infinit becaus the compani is unprofitable, and rather sharpli so. 2017 guidanc impli an oper loss of $13 million to $17 million on a non-GAAP basis.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrIn other words, for everi dollar of revenu Twilio gener thi year, it expect to lose at least 4 cents, plu anoth 3 to 4 cent in stock-bas compensation. (That dilut is exclud from Twilio stock' non-GAAP figures.)So ifAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is overvalu at 62 time earnings, TWLO stock must be even moreso. And that should make Twilio stock a tempt target for short sellers.But it' not that simple. TWLO is a growth stock after all, and growth stock can stay elev for a long time. Short seller inde have target TWLO stock, one reason share have declin so sharpli of late. But as those same short seller say, ""Valuat is not a catalyst."" And recent histori prove them right.Yes, The Number MatterValu investors, in particular, often critic stock like TWLO, with more than a bit of frustrat in their voice. ""I guess, for growth stocks, the number don't even matter."" (AMZN sharehold sure are familiar with that sentiment.)Th 10 Best Stock to Buy and Hold ForeverBut that' not the case. A compani like Twilio isn'tsupposedto be profit yet. It' not even a decad old, which isn't a long time in the competit tech space. It' invest money in attract new custom to it cloud commun service, which is what it should be doing. There' no need to forego that spend for profit now, when that spend can drive far more profit later.Pur from a valuat standpoint, it' too simplistic, particularli in the PaaS/Saa space, to look at profit without context. It' better for Twilio to spend a dollar on sale and market now - even if that add to it net loss - if that dollar is worth $3 in sale later. And the reason cloud stock have been so hype - and so highli valu - is that $1 upfront doesn't just lead to $3 later … Rather, it lead to $1, or even $2, for year and year and years.So there are investor who are take the long term - and, dare I say, fundament - approach toward Twilio stock. TWLO' valuat is base not on what it' do in 2017, but what it can do in 2020, or 2025. That lead to quit a bit of volatility, as seen in TWLO' short time on the public markets. But that volatil doesn't mean TWLO long aren't pay attention, and it doesn't mean TWLO is failing. Most notably, for short seller consid TWLO, it doesn't mean Twilio stock willkeepgo down.Senti MattersOf course, there are fundament argument for TWLO stock to continu to tumble. Unlik more well-known cloud plays, Twilio ha rel low gross margin sinc it still ha to pay network provid who transmit call and text messages. Revenu growth is guid to slow in 2017, to 33%.With similar deceleration, sale wouldn't doubl again until 2020. $700 million-plu in sale at even 15% oper margin still impli bare $100 million in oper profit. That, in turn, probabl put EP under $1 - and TWLO stock' 2020 P/E multipl abov 35.But investor should look at recent histori in the cloud space. Pretti much everi high-fli Saa or Paa stock ha had similar concerns. And pretti much all of them have held up just fine.Workday Inc(NYSE:WDAY) bottom in earli 2016 near $50; it' sinc rebound sharply, and now trade at over 10x revenue.Veeva System Inc(NYSE:VEEV) wa a popular short seller target in 2015; it' at all-tim highs, with sale multipl similar to that of TWLO.Splunk Inc(NASDAQ:SPLK) is near a 52-week high - and trade at over 8x revenu on an enterpris basis. A high valuat doesn't mean a bad stock - at least in the short term.Bottom Line on TWLO StockSo there are two concern when short a stock like TWLO. The first is that as long as near-term perform is enough to keep bullish investor happi on the long-term prospects, the stock is unlik to come down. With Twilio come out of a strong Q4 that beat expectations, that sentiment seem like to stay posit for at least the next coupl of months.Th second is that a short seller on TWLO can be right and still lose badly. ""The market can stay irrat longer than you can stay solvent,"" the old saw goes. But the market also can berationaland just flat-out wrong. A short seller, however, onli profit when the market realiz it' wrong. And that can take a long time.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Readi for a BreakoutTo be sure, short seller continu to target Twilio stock. But it' a danger game. Just ask short seller of WDAY, VEEV, SPLK or, most notably, AMZN. Time is key. And right now, the time doe not look right, at all, for a short of Twilio stock.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Dow Jone Stock That Are Weigh You Down3 Cheap Lithium Stock to Buy That Will Energ Your PortfolioTh postSorry, Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Not a Short!appear first onInvestorPlace."

This Is the Biggest Risk Facing Costco;2/17/2017;"Costco(NASDAQ: COST) ha been remark steadi in a climat where other retail have struggl as more consum move at least some of their shop online.That' at least partli becaus whileAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and other digit retail may offer compar (or even better pricing) they can't equal the warehous club' shop experience. Certainli mani consum go to Costco becaus of price, but other shop there becaus of the fun of discov what deal may be offer that day or what limited-tim season merchandis may be on the chain' no-fril shelves.Of course, some peopl also visit the warehous club becaus of the free samples, while other enjoy the abil to get a cheap meal befor or after shopping. It' a mix that ha kept the chain grow despit it have a veri limit onlin business.makeArticleAd();Costco post a decent 3% increas in Unit State compar store sale inDecemb 2016and a fairli impress 6% gain inJanuari 2017. Those may not be Amazon-lik growth numbers, but they are increas that the vast major of retail would be thrill to have.Th problem the chain face -- and it' a big risk go forward -- is that peopl are shop in store less and less. Eventu it' possible, mayb even probable, that Costco' immun to thi trend -- which ha impact so mani other retail -- will end.Imag source:YCharts.com.Wher are peopl shopping?Whil it may feel like a massiv amount of the total retail sale have move online, in reality, digit sale onli account for 8.4% of all sale in Q3 2016, accord to data from the U.S. Censu Bureau. The problem for retailers, as you can see on the chart above, is that the number ha been steadili climbing.Th Q3 2016 data repres a full 1% increas year-over-y from Q3 2015. Onlin sale have not made massiv gain each year, but consum are migrat and given the increas eas of buy thing online, there' everi reason to believ the trend will not onli continue, but accelerate.Thos increas may not impact Costco at first but they are clearli hurt other retailers. A number of chain includ Sport Authority, Linens-N-Things, Border Books, Circuit City, and other have gone out of busi over the past few year while a hand of top name are teeter on the edg in 2017.It' possibl that some of those loss actual have help Costco, but at some point the death of physic retail will push more consum online. With less physic shop choic consum may simpli decid that shop is someth they mostli do onlin and some, mayb many, could fall out of the Costco habit.A other retail close Costco could gain custom or peopl could decid to shop onlin more. Imag source: Getti Images.How can Costco fight this?Th warehous club chain ha commit to beef up it digit presenc and it ha shown some strong earli results. On a global basi in Q1 2017, ""total onlin sale were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis,"" accord to CFO Richard Galanti in the company' earn call with investors. The CFO also point out that dure the week of Thanksgiv and the two that followed, digit sale rose by the low-to-mid teens.Galanti reiter that the compani would be invest in improv the digit experi by do thing like make it easier to check out and improv the return process.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Heading to $160 on Video Capabilities;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMak excus to not likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and avoid FB stock is just plain dumb. Ahead of the company' fourth-quart earn report, I gave FB stock a Strong Buy rate with a 12-monthpric target of $150. With the earn report now in behind us, I'm inclin to rais that target to $160.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIndeed, FB stock is no bargain when share are near all-tim highs, but the company' revenu growth engin are certain to significantli impact the bottom line. Although manag didn't scale back on plan to increas capit spending, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the social media giant wa aim for shorter-form content, ha made clear that FB intend to domin video, which is where the bulk of it capex will go.And, that spend ha alreadi begun.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fli to $1,000 in 2017Last week Facebook hire Mina Lefevre, former head of script develop atViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIA). Thi hire can onli be for one reason: to increas Facebook' transit toward develop origin content. Contrari to popular opinion, Zuckerberg is not push Facebook to becom a televis network, nor doe he envis the compani compet withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). Hi drive to becom a ""video-first"" compani ha everyth to do with sell more ads.From my vantag point, the reason Facebook must spend money is becaus it ha begun to experi a problem thatTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) craves: It ha run out of ad space on it news feeds. But, Facebook doesn't want to sacrific the user experi without first know what sort of video user will want to see - and how to make them less intrusive.To that end, Lefevre, whose track record at Viacom-own MTV Network includ produc teen-focus content, is a solid hire. To the extent Facebook' shorter-form content can put it into the realm ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertis juggernaut YouTube, it would have been money well spent.7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeIn that regard, given Zuckerberg' Midas-lik qualities, it would be a mistak to avoid FB stock sole on the fear of high capex. It would make more sens to focu on the return Facebook can realiz from it investments.Bottom Line for FB StockFacebook - as it promis in the third quarter - ha signal that it will be in a period of transition. Investors, however, are now take their time to see how the increas spend balanc out with management' warn of slow ad growth. While thi might put FB stock in limbo, now is also the time to look at the big picture.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Labor Issues Could Cause Problems for TSLA Stock;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is pull back after near all-tim highs, and it' possibl that concern about Tesla' labor forc are part of the reason for the modest declin in TSLA stock. Last week, it wa report that TSLA factori worker had contact the Unit Auto Worker about creat a union.makeArticleAd();Source:Windel Oskay via Flickr (Modified)On Tesla workerpost an essay online, critic work condit at the company' facil in Fremont, California. Tesla CEO Elon Musk repli angrily, state that,""I find thi attack to be moral outrageous.""For it part, the UAW ha said that the decis to creat a union is up to Tesla workers.Fundamentally, the impact of a potenti Tesla union on TSLA stock like won't be veri signific - at least not directly. But, the kerfuffl over union highlight the potenti polit pitfal that Musk and Tesla must navigate. In an increasingli polar country, consum are start to act like voter - everi day, and that impli some potenti risk for Tesla stock.Th Fundament Impact of a Tesla Union on Tesla StockIt' tough to pars out what a Tesla union would do to TSLA earnings. Manag doesn't break out precis wages, for instance. But, we can get close to a reason estimate. In 2014,Tesla told the state of Nevadathat it Gigafactori would employ 6,500 employees, with annual total wage of $353 million.Th compani ha almost the same number of worker (6,200) at it Fremont plant, accord to a Decemb report, with plan to expand that plant and add anoth 3,100 jobs. A rough assumpt that wage are rel similar would impli that (post-expansion) potenti Tesla union worker would earn at least $500 million per year in wages.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveConsid Tesla' current shipment status, that' a larg sum. Trail 12-month sale are less than $6 billion. But, even with TSLA stock base on where Tesla is going, a wage hike could justifi a materi chang to TSLA' valuation. Even a 20% hike would add $100 million-plu in costs, or approxim $65 million per year after tax. That' roughli 40 cent per TSLA share per year;at a 30x multiple, higher wage could take as much as $12 off the fair valu of Tesla stock.However, that' an imperfect estim for a number of reasons. Tesla' focu on technolog like mean the compani will requir fewer worker over time. Plus, TSLA can find other cost to cut to offset wage pressure, as mani compani do.Still, fundamentally, there is reason to believ that a Tesla union could have a modest impact on Tesla stock. It doesn't look like union would ruin the company, as some comment believ happen toFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) befor the financi crisis. But, there is the possibl of a Tesla union have an impact on long-term earnings, and, as such, the long-term price of TSLA stock.Th Percept of Tesla and Tesla StockWher the issu get dicier for Tesla, in my opinion, is rel to the company' perception. Sinc last year' presidenti election, consum increasingli vote their polit with their pocketbooks. Liber against Presid Donald Trump have boycottedAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Macy' Inc(NYSE:M) (includ subsidiari Bloomingdale's, Inc.) and mani others.Conserv have shunnedPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP),Kellogg Company(NYSE:K) and a myriad of other companies, includ Amazon. (Evidently, though, the AMZN boycott aren't hold veri strongly.)That leav Musk, and Tesla, in a tough spot. Thi isn't the first time TSLA ha face report of underpay it labor. Last May,Th Mercuri Newsreport that the companypaid worker a mere $5 per hourdur a construct project. Manag respond by point out that it hadpaid it subcontractor $55 per hourfor the labor. And, of course, there wa yet anoth polit storm when Musk met with Presid Trump soon after the inauguration, despit howl of protest from some supporters.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteTh catch for both Tesla and TSLA stock is that the compani can't divorc itself from politics. It' a ""green"" company, which draw admir from the left. It is emphat in it intent to be ""Made in America,"" which like endear the compani to Trump. But, Tesla and Musk need to walk the line veri care to appeal to both groups.Bottom Line on TSLA StockA Tesla union could put Musk in a bit of a jam. He need to keep the pro-labor left happy, while also protect TSLA stock shareholders, and hi company' cash as it build out hi infrastructure. Push too hard against the workforce, and liber will see Musk as anoth heartless capitalist. Give too much, and investor will see Tesla as a compani run for it employees, not it sharehold - and potenti the next 2008-era GM.It' a difficult dance, and if anyon can do it, it' like Elon Musk. But, he will have to danc veri carefully.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear Strike7 Stock Warren Buffett Is Buy or SellingWhi Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Beaten-Up Cheap Stocks: Are They Bargains?;2/16/2017;"The market is not a perfect value-weigh machine. Sometimes, stock trade at dirt-cheap or sky-high valuat for good reason. In other cases, there' a plot twist just around the corner and Mr. Market never see it coming.Today, I'll take a look at three incred cheap stock and figur out whether their low valuat are reason or unfair. The compani under the len for examin areFitbit(NYSE: FIT) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , andMacy's(NYSE: M) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Fitbit ha lost a stepFitbit share have plung a massiv 57% lower in 52 weeks, includinga 30% drop in a singl daytrigg by weak fourth-quart guidance.Th stock is trade at just 14 time trail earn and 19% over Fitbit' book value. About 42% of all share were sold short a month ago, as if investor are wait for the other shoe to drop -- hard.So is thi a dramat overreact that could lead to a soar bounce, or is Fitbit in seriou trouble?In the latest earn call, Fitbit CFO Bill Zarella admit that consum demand for the company' health-monitor tool is softer than expected. The compani is a leader in a once-promis market, but the market opportun is turn out to be smaller than Fitbit thought.In other words, today' step counter and puls tracker might just be a fad without stay power. It' quit possibl that a real market for these featur won't emerg until the hardwar can be found as a freebi in your next cereal box, or thrown in as a no-cost bonu in anoth product. If so, there' no real valu to be found in fit tracker -- at least none that will stick around for the long haul.Fitbit' strongest asset is it solid balanc sheet. Back out $3 of cash per share, the stock would actual be trade at just 3.9 time trail earnings. Arm with $672 million in cash and short-term invest but no long-term debt at all, the compani ha a few years' worth of financi support that let manag take risk and tri drastic strategi shift in order to relight the growth fires.Personally, I would hardli back up the truck to the Fitbit window. A small, specul invest might be appropri becaus the compani might be abl to find new markets. I could also be wrong about the faddish natur of fit trackers.But one-hit wonder never catch a second wind, and I wouldn't be surpris to see Fitbit fall into that wist category. If Fitbit is a bargain, it' a terribl riski one. Keep your buy small, and be fulli prepar to lose it all. Thi is a gamble, not an investment.First Solar is wait for a moment in the sunLik Fitbit, First Solar ha seen share price crash in recent months. The stock ha plung 43% lower in 52 weeks. Also like Fitbit, thi stock is object cheap -- First Solar trade at just seven time trail earnings, or 2.7 if you back out $20 of net cash per share from the share price. Furthermore, both compani use to sport rambuncti sale growth figures, but have slow down consider in recent years.But that' where the similar end.Rath than a potenti fad, First Solar work in a field of explos growth opportunities. Solar product and instal costshav fallen 90% in a decade, make the technolog a seriou altern to oil, coal, and natur gas. First Solar' stall sale growth will continu in 2017, or mayb even turn neg for a varieti of polit and oper reasons. But the long-term valu here is undeniable, and First Solar is a proven leader in thi industry.Solar stock in gener are prime for a rebound today -- andFirst Solar more so than most.Yes, thi is a genuin bargain. You can quot me on that.Macy' bricks-and-mortar messRetail veteran Macy' can't quit match First Solar' or Fitbit' extrem one-year market drops, but share price have inde plung 55% lower in about 18 months. The fall of 2015 wa not kind to Macy' investors.Mind you, 2016 realli should have rough the stock up even further. Here' why:M Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.Macy' ha seen it revenu slide south over the last four quarters, which wouldn't be a huge problem if profit margin wa on the rise. Instead, the store chain' profit is plunging. Managementrec close down 100 locations, even in profit markets. Same-stor sale fell over the holidays. There isn't much good to say about Macy' these days. Like most of it bricks-and-mortar peers, the retail is fight for it life against onlin retail led byAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Thi compani doe seem open to tri new ideas, such as the Backstag discount-store-within-a-stor concept or the smaller-s BlueMercuri beauti outlets. But the age of big-box retail is draw to a close, and none of these admir move will do much to delay the inevitable.Macy' had better embrac the onlin retail market wholeheartedly, befor it' too late. A hand of old-lin depart store will make it, but most will die defend the outdat busi model they hold too dear to kill.Sadly, Macy' seem destin for the great outlet store in the sky unless manag make some drastic attitud changes. Manag still insist that the in-stor experi alway will form an effect weapon against onlin sellers. The company' financi report don't even break out onlin sale so they can be discuss or analyzed.It' not too late to turn the sink ship around, but it'd be an unlik and difficult turnaround battl -- and Macy' isn't even think about the core problem in the right term yet. Until further notice, then, Macy' low share price is more of a fall knife than an invit bargain.10 stock we like better than First SolarWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com Is Giving Us a Closer Glimpse of Its Prime Subscriber Numbers;2/16/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) doesn't like to give Wall Street more inform than it ha to. It took a long time for the compani to show investor the financi of Amazon Web Services, it cloud comput platform, and it wa alreadi a $4.6 billion busi by the time Amazon did. But Amazon' report a new revenu categori for it retail oper that give us a small glimps into how big Amazon Prime is.In it latest 10-K filing, Amazon report a line item call ""retail subscript services."" The segment includ ""annual and monthli fee associ with Amazon Prime membership, as well as audiobook, e-book, digit video, digit music, and other subscript services,"" accord to the SEC filing. Those servic brought in $6.4 billion in revenu last year.Th number could give us a hint as to how mani Prime member Amazon has.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Amazon.com.Th minimum number of Prime membersOv the past few years, manag ha given us some hint as to how mani Prime member Amazon has. Here' what manag said, and what it impli for Amazon' membership numbers.YearWhat Manag SaidMinimum Number of Prime Member Implied2013""W now have ten of million of member worldwide.""20 million2014""Worldwid paid membership grew 53% last year.""30.6 million2015""Worldwid paid Prime membership increas 51%""46.2 million2016""Ten of million of new paid member join the program in just thi past year.""66.2 millionHow do those number compar with subscript revenue?What' interest about these impli number is that subscript revenu grew at the same rate as Prime member last year -- 43%. Subscript revenu grew 62% in 2015, faster than the 51% growth in Prime membership. So while Prime is definit the biggest factor, it' not the onli thing contribut revenue.Audible, with it ""million of subscribers"" pay at least $14.95 per month, is a sizabl factor as well, at least 5%. Add in a few Kindl Unlimit subscrib and some Amazon Music subscribers, and it' possibl Prime account for as much as 90% of Amazon' subscript revenue, asMorgan Stanley' Brian Nowack estimates.That impli the averag global Prime member pay at most $86.93 per year, if we presum Amazon ha at least 66.2 million of them.That number seem a bit high, consid two-third of Amazon' sale come from outsid the U.S., where Prime is usual less expensive. For example, over 10% of total sale came from Germani last year, where Amazon charg just 49 euro ($52) per year for Prime last year. Japan account for about 8% of sales, and Prime cost just 3,900 yen ($34) per year. Prime in Canada is just 79 Canadian dollar ($60.50).Consid the impact of lower-pr Prime subscript around the world and regular promot in the U.S., it' like the averag Prime member pay closer to $80 per month. At that rate, there are as mani as 72 million total Prime member around the world. A more conserv estim might be the midpoint -- 69 million.But the number could be even higherAmazon doesn't count all the cash it receiv from Prime member as revenu when they sign up for the service. Instead, it amort the yearli fee over the 12-month membership length. Each month it transfer a certain amount fromunearn revenueto it revenue.A such, estim use revenu from all of 2016 can onli provid an averag number of Prime member for the full year. And sinc the number is go up, Amazon' current Prime membership number are certainli higher than it averag membership number from last year.Consid the holiday season is prime time to sign up for Prime (pun intended), sign-up are like backload in Amazon' fiscal year. The result is Amazon ha significantli more Prime member than what it number can tell us. While Amazon gave us a glimps at how much revenu it Prime member are producing, it' still obfusc the actual number of member itself.Regardless, it' a veri big number, and it' still grow rapidly. That' as much as Amazon investor can ask for, and it should make them veri happy.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

An incom investor who got in on the 1999 IPO, pay $14 per share, is now collect $10 per share in dividend each year.Som of the capit gain are a trick of the light. BlackRock did not particip in the ""dot-bomb,"" the collaps of Internet stock that began in earli 2000 afterTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) gave AOL 60% of it equiti in a merger.

And, even dure that crisi - where it market cap wa cut in half and other compani collaps complet - BlackRock did not cut that dividend.America' Best Banker?CEO and co-found Larri Fink is not often mention in the same breath as banker like Jami Dimon ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein ofGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS); he just doe better for hi investors.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveBlackRock wasfound in 1988with oper capit from Pete Peterson of the Blackston Group, from which it separ in 1995 after a disput withStephen Schwarzmann, orchestr withPNC Financi Servic Group Inc(NYSE:PNC), whose invest arm came into BlackRock in 1998.

It' current buy First Reserv Energi Infrastructur Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-produc energi project like mid-stream pipelines, grab for Trump' infrastructur moneywith both hands.Fink is skeptic of the Trump rally, and of the President' plan for the dollar. Fink still love the Mexican peso and is worri about the futur of the global economi in the age of Trump. But, BlackRock keep polit and busi separate, it respons to the travel ban mainli a letter to employees.BlackRock' ETF busi hasmor than $1 trillion in assets.It consid Russia a buy, but is skeptic of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequ Georg Osborn join BLK as an adviser.Trad Apple, Inc. or Own It?

It brought approxim one-third of revenu to the net incom line becaus most of it money came in the form of invest advisori fees, from administr fee and secur lending.Bottom Line for BlackRock StockWhen BlackRock plung into a stock, it can hold up, despit real busi pressures.

Amazon Plans to Drop Packages With Parachutes From Drones;2/16/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ha long teas consum with the idea that it would someday deliv packag via drones.Th compani ha pursu the idea even though it' not current legal to use unman fli vehicl for most commerci activ (includ packag delivery) in the Unit States. And while that could eventu change, the Feder Aviat Administr (FAA) ha so far been wari of the retailer' vision that someday the sky could be fill with package-bear drones.Thos signific implement hurdl howev have not stop the onlin retail from advanc the develop of what it call Prime Air. The goal of that effort, accord to the company, is ""to safe get packag to custom in 30 minut or less use unman aerial vehicles, also call drones,"" accord to Amazon'sweb pagefor the service. The compani see drone as have the potenti to allow it to improv it servic and deliveri time while also increas ""the overal safeti and effici of the transport system.""makeArticleAd();Exactli how the retail intend to do that ha remain a bit of a mystery. Would drone fli up and knock on your door? Would they bring packag to window or drop them from the sky? Now, a newpat filingfrom Amazon show at least one method the compani could use -- drop packag on parachut from drones.Amazon plan to use drone like thi one to deliv packages. Imag source: Amazon.What is Amazon doing?In it patent file the onlin leader explain that it plan a packag deliveri system that would launch a packag from a drone or unman aerial vehicl (UAV) while it' in motion. The drone would be abl to control the descent of the packag in a number of way which the compani laid out in it filing.Th packag deliveri system can appli the forc onto the packag in a number of differ ways. For example, pneumat actuators, electromagnets, spring coils, and parachut can gener the forc that establish the vertic descent path of the package. Further, the packag deliveri system can also monitor the packag dure it vertic descent.Essenti a parachut and/or other control mechan would help guid the packag to Earth. It/they would also be abl to steer the packag around obstruct or help it regain stabil if someth disrupt it flight.Whi doe Amazon want this?Th onlin retail ha built warehous all around the U.S. and setup ship oper which allow it to offer two-day deliveri across the country. In some market it ha improv on that with same-day delivery, but use trucks, people, and even courier to make deliveri is expensive. Use drone would, at least with some deliveri in some markets, make get packag to consum cheaper and more efficient.Amazon explain in it patent file that the use of UAV can overcom some of the ineffici of tradit deliveri method ""bi leverag more flexibl aerial transport path between destinations, rather than reli on rigid road infrastructure."" In theori drone can travel more direct rout and deliv more packag than tradit methods. The onlin retail doe acknowledg that drone come with their own problem becaus at some point they have to drop off the package.""Traditionally, thi involv the UAV land at the destination, releas the package, and then take off to it next destination,"" wrote the company. ""The sequenc of land and take off for each packag deliveri creat time and energi resourc inefficiencies, which negat at least a portion of the benefit of adopt a network system of UAVs.""Us parachut solv that problem. It' like that a parachute-bas solut would onli work with certain products, in select area (it' hard to pictur parachut fall in Manhattan) and thi patent is onli one possibl way Amazon would use drone for deliveries.I thi go to happen?It' easi to see the busi reason Amazon want to use drones. If it can offer near-immedi deliveri in broad coverag area the onlin retail take away the last advantag brick-and-mortar store have. The challeng in do that remain solv the problem of the last mile -- get item from a nearbi warehous to the consumer.Dron may be part of that solution, but it still may be a long time befor broad use of UAV becom legal or even practical. There' a point where use UAV with parachut may make sense, but the process would have to be effici enough to make financi sens for Amazon. That' someth the compani need to work on and it' a challeng that' equal as daunt as the signific legal hurdl that current keep drone deliveri from be a reality.Someday drone deliveri will be a real thing, at least in certain situations. That day howev remain in the distant future.

Attunity Ltd. - Big Data Enabler With 84% Upside;2/15/2017;"ByCobiaman:Shar Price - $8.00Market Cap - $140 millionEnterpris Valu - $131 million2016 Revenu - $54.5 million2017 Revenu - $66.9 million (23% growth)2018 Revenu - $82.5 million (23% growth)EV/2016 Revenu - 2.4xEV/2017 Revenu - 1.9xEV/2018 Revenu - 1.6xAttun Ltd. (ATTU) provid softwar to enterpris use to replic and integr heterogen data sourc into a singl data lake, which provid the basi for creat data warehous use for Big Data analysis. The compani ha been in exist for 20 years, first provid softwar use to integr mainfram data and then ad more data sourc as they becam avail in the market. Current data sourc includ Oracl (Oracle), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Amazon Redshift (AMZN), Teradata (TDC), Hadoop, and modern stream data sources. The compani ha OEM relationship with Microsoft and Amazon where the compani emb Attunity' solut into their own when data replic is call for.Attunity' revenu grew quickli in the 2014-2015 time frame, with 43% growth in 2014 and 36% growth in 2015. Thi growth wa driven by the need to gather data from variou corpor sourc and assembl it into data warehous for analysis. Attun ha a simpl but power solut that enabl a much faster time to analysi for it customers. Attun is admittedli a smaller player in the market face bigger competit in Informatica (INFA) and IBM (IBM), but it solut is robust and ha proven success for it custom base. In 2014 and 2015, Attun mostli sold into smaller opportun of $1 million or less with six to nine month sale cycles. By 2016, Attunity' success and increas name recognit began to attract larger deal with longer sale cycl and differ sale team requirements. The compani found that some of it sale forc wa not up to the task and revenu onli grew 11% as some larg deal slip dure the year.makeArticleAd();Attun manag acknowledg the problem and swap out 15 of it weaker sale hand and replac them with more experienc enterpris softwar sale people. Our work suggest that the company' problem in 2016 wa inde company-specif as the market for it type of softwar remain robust. Manag is convinc that the worst of it sale issu are behind it and thi wa born out by a beat and rais Decemb quarter. The compani notch sale of $15.6 million versu expect of $14.3 million. Guidanc for 2017 wa set at $62-65 million, abov consensu of $60 million.W believ that after the company' tough 2016, manag is guid more conserv for 2017 than it did last year. The market seem to be support of growth rate seen in 2014 and 2015, yet neither the manag team nor the analyst want to get ahead of themselv at thi point. Given the veri high gross margin in thi busi (90%), there is a ton of oper leverag onc revenu get moving. Manag guid to 5-8% oper margin in 2017 but these could go much higher, especi in 2018, if revenu ramp ahead of plan.W valu ATTU on an enterpris valu to revenu basi base on 2018 numbers. Base on our current 2018 revenu forecast, ATTU trade at 1.6x revenue. We believ it should trade at a substanti higher multipl of 3x. The closest public comp, Talend SA (TLND) trade at 4x 2018 number and oper in essenti the same market. At 3x, ATTU would be worth $14.72, or 84% higher than it current trade price.In term of an endgame, Attun could grow organ for an extend period in thi larg market, but it could also present an interest acquisit target for a larger strateg or financi player. The CEO, Shimon Alon, is the largest sharehold with 8% of the stock, so he ha a consider financi interest in the company' future. Interestingli Microsoft, as an OEM partner, ha right of first refus for ani acquisit propos by anoth party. Thi demonstr the import of ATTU to Microsoft and presum to it other OEM partner.Attun is a bit of a relic in it perpetu licens revenu model. While most softwar compani today are in the Software-as-a-Servic ((SAAS)) model, Attunity' custom base demand ownership of it softwar products, so it sell to them in a perpetu fashion. Thi busi model is a two-edg sword as revenu above/below forecast drop to the bottom line and caus larg EP beats/misses. The main risk for Attun is that some deal slip out of a quarter caus a revenu and earn shortfall.Se alsoBuffett Flee Wal-Mart: Begin Of The End For The Giant Retailer?on seekingalpha.com"

Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks;2/15/2017;"When I first start investing, I judg dividend-pay stock sole on their yield. In my mind, the higher the yield, the better.Thankfully, I quickli learn that invest in incom stock base on their yield alon is a huge mistake. In fact, a super-high yield can often be a sign ofdanger. That' whi I'v been refin my process for dividend stock select for years, and I now focu on sever other factor befor make a buy or sell decision.So what are those factors? Below, you'll find the checklist I use to put a dividend-pay stock to the test.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Test No. 1: Predict revenueI'm convinc that the bestdividend stockshav control over their top line. After all, compani that depend on factor outsid of their control for revenu can see their profit evapor when the market take a downturn.A shine exampl of a compani with predict revenu isBroadridg Financi Solutions(NYSE: BR) . Broadridg help other compani with record keep and investor commun by handl bore but mission-crit financi paperwork such as proxi statement and prospectuses. The busi wa spun offADPin 2007 and it truli domin it industry, boast a market share of roughli 80%. Sinc compani need to remain in contact with their investor through all market conditions, Broadridge' financi statement arehighlypredictable.Bi contrast, consid the offic suppli retailerStaples(NASDAQ: SPLS) . With a massiv yield of 5.2% (more than twice the S&P 500' averag dividend yield of 2.2%!), the old me would have been foam at the mouth to buy the stock. However, Staples' revenu ha been declin for year due to the signific pressur from e-commerc compani such asAmazon.com.Hav a look at what ha happen to these two compani top-lin over the past five years.BR Revenu (TTM)data byYChartsWhil Staples' managementha a planto help revers the trend, I don't have ani confid in thi company' abil to gener predict top-lin result from here, so I would urg investor to look elsewher for opportunity.Test No. 2: A sustain payout ratioTh next must-know metric for ani dividend stock is itspayout ratio. Thi figur is calcul by divid the company' dividend payment per share by it earn per share. For example, if a company' annual dividend payment is $1 per share and it earn are $4 per share, then it payout ratio is 25% ($1/$4).In general, a low payout ratio suggest that a dividend is sustain sinc it provid the compani with financi flexibl in case someth bad happens. Thus, ani stock with a veri high payout ratio -- say, abov 80% -- should be approach with caution, even if it pass the first test.For that reason, I'v taken a pass on the cigarett and real estat companyVector Group(NYSE: VGR) . That might come as a surpris sinc thi company' top line is highli predict and ha been grow for years. With a dividend yield of 7.1%, what' not to like?VGR Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.That' all great, but Vector Group ha sport a payout ratio abov 100% for sever years, mean that it dividend payment exce it net income. The compani ha pull off thi trick by turn to the debt market to fund the difference. While thi strategi ha work for some time, it current payout ratio of 262% is a big caus for concern.Bi contrast, Broadridg offer up a much smaller dividend yield of 1.9%. However, Broadridge' payout ratio is onli 48% of trail earning, which suggest that it dividend is far more stabl than Vector Group's.Test No. 3: Strong growth prospectsThebest dividend stocksnot onli sustain their current payout but canincreasethem over time, too. That whi I exclud compani that pass the first two test but are not expect to grow much over the come years.ConsiderFirstEnergy(NYSE: FE) . As a utility, it revenu is highli predictable. In addition, it low payout ratio of 51% suggest that it dividend yield of 4.6% is quit sustainable.However, FirstEnergy' age power plant run primarili on coal, so it expens have been on the rise as it work to reduc it carbon emissions. When mix with slow but steadi declin in revenue, it profit have taken a big hit over the last few years.F Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.Wors yet, market watcher believ thi trend will continu for the forese future. Analyst project that the company' profit will declin by more than 5% annual over the next few years. While the Trump administr ha taken a pro-coal stance, the long-term outlook for the industri istoo toughto ignore. That lead me to believ that thi is a stock to avoid.Yet again, thi is a test that Broadridg Financi pass with fli colors. The combin of organ growth and acquisit should allow the compani to grow it top-lin by singl digit over the next five years. Better yet, modest margin improv and share buyback are expect to fuel 12% earn growth over thi time frame.Given all of the above, perhap it isn't surpris to learn that I think that Broadridg Financi is a top-notch dividend stock. With a predict revenu stream, a sustain payout ratio, and solid growth prospects, thi compani pass my test with fli colors. That make Broadridg a strong dividend stock that ani incom investor could learn to love.10 stock we like better than Broadridg Financi SolutionsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Worry About Oracle;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAl too much like Jame Cameron' 2009 sci-fi flickAvatar, just when you think the feud betweenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is over, you find out it' not.* Last week, the icon databas compani told the icon search engin compani it wa appeal a rule made against Oracl - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owner either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it' the latter, it' not terribl surprising. The compani formerli known as Googl is su on a regular basis, often by parti with weak case just look for a payday.GOOGL sharehold may want to take a closer look thi time around though. While success appeal case are tough, Oracle' argument hold slightli more water than the typic long-shot caselik the one Vringo levi (and ultim lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have signific repercuss for other outfit in the heat of similar argument about open sourc software.GOOGL: Here We Go AgainWarning: You may need to read through the intricaci of thi case twice to fulli understand what' go on, and even then, there' no guarante it will make complet sense. Here' the crux of the argument though … Oracl say Alphabet use a littl too much of it Java softwar - which is free, open-sourc softwar - in it Android oper system.Th suit larg hing on what constitut ""fair use"" of open-sourc and freely-avail software.7 Stock to Buy for the Futur of TVWhile Oracl offer Java for ani consum to download and ani develop to util piec of, the compani contend it wa never intend for wide swath of the code to be cut and past and util as part of a commercial, revenue-bear system.Th complaint specif read:""Th undisput evid show that Googl verbatim copi the heart of Oracle' creativ work for an entir commerci purpos without ani chang to Oracle' express content or message, took far more than necessari to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harm the market for Java.""Th strength of Oracle' copyright on it applic program interfaces, or APIs, wa particularlyemphasizedbi the compani in the prior juri trial.Alphabet' counterargu is simpler -CEO Larri Page said, ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""If all of thi ring a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there' a reason. Thi argument ha been wage in a courtroom a few times, go back as far as 2010. The current stage for thi battl of the titan is an appeal of last year' loss suffer by Oracle. That case' loss like save Alphabet Inc from be forc to pay the $9 billion in damag Oracl wa seeking.Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and OthersOwn of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worri about here. The court side with the compani in the most recent case, and appeal - a revers of a prior judgment - are veri difficult win.Th case, though, will have far-reach consequ beyond the Alphabet/Oracl tiff. In essence, thi contest could larg help affirm just how ""open"" open sourc code realli is even if it user end up commerci it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhap in a bigger sens though, thi trial will onc again serv as an indict on decenc (or lack thereof) and common sens (or, again, lack thereof).Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fli to $1,000 in 2017While not a legal matter rais dure ani of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror' mind were apt to be ask themselv whi Oracl would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commerci use - if it didn't want it to be use thi extensively.Anoth relev but unask question is whi Java' origin developer, Sun Microsystems, support Android' use of the platform befor Oracl acquir Sun, but Oracl switch gear on the stanc after buy Sun Microsystems. And, perhap if Oracl had been more clear about how it rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harm the market for Java"" when it' not realli otherwis monetized, a judg and juri could have been a littl more sympathetic.A it stand though, the Oracl argument look to be found more on regret and frustrat and less on merits. The court so far seem to be pick up on that.Broadli speaking, it all bode well for other entiti that have somehow commerci open sourc softwar and APIs.* Avatar, while a stunningli success film, wa a three hour epic, and could have easili end at two point in the film befor the third (and actual) ending.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy Today10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatTh postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holder Shouldn't Worri About Oracleappear first onInvestorPlace."
How Amazon Payments Could Be The Next Big Thing;2/15/2017;"While retail seem like an old-school business, Amazon ha integr it with innov and advanc technology, creat a compani that challeng player across industries. Amazon.com (AMZN) doesn't just domin the U.S. e-commerc marketplac - it’ among the top cloud comput platforms, and is well known for it cargo plane and drone too.To further expand and strengthen it ecosystem of product and services, Amazonlaunchedit payment gateway – ‘Pay with Amazon’ in Octob 2013 with an aim to provid an uninterrupt shop experi to it custom and affili onlin merchants. However, number of custom engag with ‘Pay with Amazon’ trail behind it e-commerc users.A per a surveyreportbi Channel Advisor, when compar marketplaces, “more than 60% of respond said Amazon is gener the greatest sale volum for their products.” However, when it come to payments, about 70% of respond name PayPal as the most commonli use payment method by custom after onli debit/credit cards. 15% go with Amazon Payments.makeArticleAd();Whil thi is reflect of Amazon’ struggl in a highli competit payment market, it is also indic of the huge opportun that lie ahead for Amazon Payments. Here’ whi Amazon Payment could becom a signific revenu gener for Amazon chang it ‘underappreciated’ statu go forward.Grow E-Commerc MarketWhil the e-commerc marketplac is expand fast, it continu to be a small segment of the total retail market. In the U.S., the retail e-commerc sale for the third quarter of 2016 were just 8.35% of the total retail sale that were estim at $1.21 trillion as per areportbi the U.S. Censu Bureau of the Depart of Commerce. eMarket estim that the worldwid retail e-commerc sale will increas to $4.05 trillion in 2020, make up 14.6% of total retail spend that year.Th scope to penetr further into the e-commerc segment provid Amazon with a big opportun and give a fair chanc for hundr of merchant to join the onlin bandwagon. Thi indirectli open a vast ground for it affili payment servic which nearli doubl the payment volum in 2016.Beyond The Top MerchantsAmazon’ payment servic enabl custom visit websit of partner compani to pay use their Amazon account (shipment address, card information, etc.). However, due to fear of reveal custom data to Amazon, mani e-commerc entiti have avoid the adopt of ‘Pay with Amazon’. Thi trend ha benefit PayPal, ApplePay, Googl Wallet and other payment providers.Interestingly, there is enough room for Amazon to grow beyond the top e-retail by rope in second and third-tier onlin merchant in the U.S. and worldwid who aren’t intimid by Amazon (with mani sell good through Amazon) and valu the trust provid by Amazon payment gateway.Such partnership need not be limit to e-retail but ani servic provid use digit payment (such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, taxi services). By ad the ‘Pay with Amazon’ button, these merchant make spend much simpler for the 300 million plu user base of Amazon on their portals. Dure 2016, more than 33 million customersusedAmazon Payment to make a purchase.Connect CarsAmazon is make it way into the connect car space by team up with automobil compani to integr it cloud-bas voic servic Alexa to enabl custom to play audiobooks, check weather, control Alexa-en smart home and even shop. Amazon’ current tie-up includ brand such asFord,Hyundai,Volkswagen,BMW,GenesisandINRIX.Whil thi is just the begin and most of the featur are limit to remot command to car from home and vice versa, such collabor would add new custom by offer them a new way to interact with their car and shop at Amazon.com especi for regularli bought items. Thi could strengthen it clientel for Prime and ‘Pay with Amazon’ to build a strong sens of trust and service.Fin WordAmazon is by far the largest e-commerc compani in the U.S. and the 8thbiggest retailerbi revenu (wa 15th in 2012) and is rapidli spread it wing in Europ and Asia. With Amazon’ expans into newer segment such as connect cars, increas number of Prime member which constitut half of it ‘Pay with Amazon’ users, and more and more busi go online, there’ high probabl that Amazon Payment will steadili garner a bigger market share and emerg as a strong revenu driver for the compani in the future."

Strong Econ Data to Sway March Fed Decision?;2/15/2017;"Wednesday, Februari 15, 2017makeArticleAd();New econom data relev to a possibl Fed interest rate decis next month ha hit the tape prior to today' open bell. Retail Sales, the Consum Price Index (CPI) and the Empir State Manufactur Survey have report figur higher than expect by analysts, point toward inflat build within the U.S. economy.Retail Sale beat expectations, come in at +0.4% on the headlin number. Key within thi report is when one strip out auto sales, that number jump to +0.8%. Year over year, Retail Sale are up 2.3%; you'd have to go back to 2008 to see a higher read than that. Even though retail overal struggl dure the 2016 holiday season, at least some of thi rest on headwind from competit from AmazonAMZN. What we instead see through report like thi is actual inflat creep into the retail space.Speak of Retail, Presid Trump meet with top execut from retail major such as TargetTGT, GapGPS, Best BuyBBYand J.C.

Better still, revenu as well as profit per share of MGM stock took a decid turn for the better dure the third quarter of 2016, suggest the casino oper wa final shake off the funk from a 2015government crackdown on China' gambl enclav … Macau.makeArticleAd();Wa Q3 just a stroke of luck, or is MGM Resort realli on the mend? Owner of MGM stock will get an answer to that question befor the market open on Thursday morning.Here' what investor need to know.MGM Resort Earn PreviewIt hasn't been an easi coupl of year for MGM Resort International. Although the stock is well up sinc Februari of last year, the bulk of that gain ha been made more on hope and less on actual results.Th company, along with other casino names, ha been digest the impact of a government-induc slowdown in Macau - onc consid a panacea for casino oper - and a growth slowdown in gambl activ here in the Unit State asonlin and offlin altern continu to proliferate.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayAnd yet, just as the industri begin work on rekindl growth of the U.S. market, in Januari Macau' casino' log a sixth straight month of year-over-year improv in game revenue.At the same time, while oper in the Unit State seem to be fight more competitor for fewer dollars, owner of MGM stock can celebr the fact that the compani can expand it footprint, profitably. In it first full month of oper (January),MGM Resorts' Nation Harbor casino in Oxon Hill, Maryland becam the state' most play game venue.In other words, MGM Resort is head into it fourth-quart report with a tailwind.A of the latest look, analyst expect the casino and resort outfit to report earn of 20 cent per share of MGM stock on revenu of $2.46 billion. The compani lost six cent per share on $2.192 billion in sale for the same quarter a year earlier. MGM Resort blew away it Q3 expectations, underscor three quarter worth of much-need progress.In fact, MGM hastop earn estim in each of it prior three quarters.Thre Thing to Watch for MGM StockWhil MGM Resort ha been and continu to be a multi-facet company, the forese futur for MGM stock larg depend on three specif matters. In no certain order …MacauWhil Macau' casino industri is on the mend, there' still plenti of repair work that need to be done. Case in point: While Macau' Januari revenu wa up a healthi 3.1%, that still fell short of expectations. MGM need Macau' growth potential. The region onli make up about a tenth of the company' business, but it could be much more if the Chines enclav continu to rebound.Onlin GamingWhil MGM is increasingli compet with onlin alternatives, don't think it' not in the busi itself. MGM Resort now complet own Atlant City' Borgata,which give it access to the state' legal onlin gambl market. Last year' onlin revenu for New Jersey wa a pittanc to the now-par company, but with a stronger name to leverage, MGM may well make thi grow venu a viabl one. And that' just one state where onlin game is now allowed. Sever more offer it, repres a new opportun for the casino operator.JapanTh idea first surfac late last year, and the chatter hasn't abat … Japan may be on the verg of legal casino gambl the way Macau did. If that happens, look for that nation' casino scene to becom the next Macau. Onli bigger. The compani ha alreadi said it'sreadi to commit $10 billion to establish a presenc there, and there' no reason to think it won't pull that trigger to be the first one to set up shop.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fli to $1,000 in 2017Bottom Line on MGMRegardless of how thing pan out on Thursday, MGM Resort Intern is a compani on a turnaround path, and it remain one of the more compel prospect in the industry. As JPMorgan' analystsput itearli in the month:""W continu to believ that MGM possess the best risk-reward in gaming, with ~65% of it cash flow come from the La Vega Strip (and onli ~10% exposur to Macau), a market with no new suppli growth and group/convent momentum, which should allow it to garner continu attract (and abov U.S. lodg industry) overal room price and non-gaming, out of the room spend growth aid by increment EBITDA come from the T-Mobil Arena and Park relat investments.""In other words, MGM Resort is do well where it need to - La Vega - while other name in the busi likeLa Vega Sand Corp.(NYSE:LVS) remain bog down by anover-commitmentto a still-tough Macau market. Macau (and then Japan and onlin gaming) is just a littl gravy.

The strength of Amazon ha unavoid weigh on the share price of more tradit retail that find themselv strung with slow sale and inescap costs.Ther is no doubt that consumer is aliv and well in the heart of the American economy. Which is whi it’ worth consid if the pendulum of momentum will eventu swing back in the direct of numer stalwart retail competitors.On way to gaug and potenti invest in thi trend is through diversifi exchange-trad fund (ETFs) that track a basket of retail stocks. TheSPDR S&P Retail ETF(XRT) is by far the largest and most wide follow ETF in thi space. XRT own approxim 100 share of publicly-trad retail compani that are primarili domicil in the Unit States. Thi includ industri sub-sector such as apparel, automotive, food, depart stores, drug stores, specialti retail, and electronics. The fund current ha $850 million in total asset and charg a net expens ratio of 0.35%.makeArticleAd();Th most interest featur of XRT may be it equal-weight composition.

LendingClub Corp (LC) Stock Isn’t Doomed After Q4 Earnings, But …;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsHead into the company' fourth quarter earn report, thing were look up forLendingClub Corp(NYSE:LC). LendingClub did dip a bit ahead of it Q4 earn release, but LC stock still wa up by more than 80% from it May low below $4. A solid Q3 report, plu a billion-dollar fund deal, establish that the busi had stabilized.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Simon Cunningham via Flickr (Modified)That didn't mean LendingClub' problem were fixed, of course. LC stock still trade well off post-IPO high abov $25. LendingClub itself is unprofitable, if modestli so. But it appear that the worst of the company' problem were behind it - hopefully.New manag wa rebuild investor trust - particularli after a scandal involv former CEO Renaud Laplanche. Funder were back, includ the recent $1.3 billion invest from a subsidiari of theNat Bank of Canada(OTCMKTS:NTIOF). And LendingClub origin nearli $2 billion in loan in it third quarter, in line with it plans. Some of those origin requir LendingClub to pay incent to entic lender to stick with the platform, which took $11 million off Q3 earnings. But those payment stop in Septemb - further evid that the busi had normalized.LendingClub earn on Tuesday even seem to support that narr - yet LC stock sold off by 9% on Wednesday regardless.But the neg reaction make some sense. LendingClub may have stabil it operations, but thi is where the hard work begins.Whi LC Stock Declin After Q4 EarningsLendingClub' fourth-quart earn did beat analyst expectations. An adjust net loss of 2 cent per share beat the Street by a penny. A revenu declin of 4% wa five point better than the consensus.But the number also illustr a compani still work to rebound from it 2016 struggles.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteWhil loan origin increas against the previou quarter (albeit by less than 1%), they were down 23% year-over-year. Revenu yield (revenu as a percentag of originations) rose sharply, but mostli due to higher fees. Adjust EBITDA revers from posit $25 million a year ago to a loss of over $2 million in Q4 2016.The larger issu appear to be 2017 guidance. In the LendingClub earn release, the compani forecast revenu of $565 million-$595 million. That figur came in below analyst estimates, which averag $597 million. LC doe expect to return to EBITDA profitability, with that figur project at $40 million-$55 million after a full-year loss in 2016. But even those level suggest a declin from 2015, when LendingClub earn almost $70 million on that basis.Al told, there' a bit of a ""sell the news"" feel to the market' reaction.Investor have bid up LC stock over the past few month in advanc of the busi stabilizing. That stabil appear to have occurred. Bank have return to the platform, fund 31% of loan in Q4 against just 13% in Q3. Origin were just shi of $2 billion, in line with compani targets. All told, LendingClub earn show a compani that is past the worst of it problems.Th catch is that LendingClub stock is price for a bit more than that.LendingClub Stock In 2017Even account for $800 million in cash, and assum LendingClub hit the high end of 2017 guidance, the stock still trade at about 30 time next year' adjust EBITDA. That figur includ some $91 million in stock-bas compens - nearli twice the midpoint of project profitability.Guid also suggest a GAAP loss for the full year, and narrow profit (~8 cent per share at the high end) on an adjust basis.LC stock still is price in a reason amount of growth. To be sure, revenu guidanc suggest a solid increas year-over-year of about 17%. The concern is costs. Exclud one-tim and non-cash effect (but includ share-bas comp), oper expens increas 43% in 2016. Sale and market deleverag in Q4 as well, accord to the LendingClub earn call. And the compani expect ""elevated"" market spend in the first half of 2017 -along with continu EBITDA losses.Part of the immedi reaction to LendingClub earnings, then, like come from manag essenti push expect out to the back half. But from a long-term standpoint, that hardli break the bull case for LendingClub stock. Some of the first-half pressur is come from effort to improv long-term growth. Expens relat to the rollout of auto refinancing, higher marketing, and tighter credit all are pressur first-half margins.Trad of the Day: Thi Nvidia Corpor (NVDA) Stock Dip Is a BuyInvestor bet on a long-term turnaround in LC stock, then, shouldn't necessarili be dissuad by the Q4 report.LC Stock: Buy It or Sell It?Th concern I have is that, even with LendingClub stock well off it all-tim highs, the stock still isn't cheap. It' not even close.On the LendingClub earn call, CFO Tom Casey said it wa import to exit 2017 with adjust EBITDA higher than stock-bas compensation. That perform - should LC get there - is a far cri from support an enterpris valu that still is more than $1.5 billion at earli Wednesday prices.Similarly, a goal of 20% margin at $565 million impli just ~$115 million in EBITDA, or about $25 million less 2017 share issuance. That impli a 60x-plu multipl at current levels, and mean LendingClub need to show a lot more growth to keep LC stock abov even $6.From that perspective, the reaction to LendingClub earn make some sense. Yes, the compani appear to be on the right track. But Q4 earn and 2017 guidanc show just far LC ha to go.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhi Amazon.com, Inc.

How Safe Is Wal-Mart Stock and Its Dividend?;2/15/2017;"Retail giantWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ha long enjoy a signific competit advantag thank to it massiv scale. Wal-Mart is abl to get the best price from it supplier and pass those save onto it customers, make it next to imposs for tradit retail to compet on price.But the continu rise of e-commerc ha chang the equation, put Wal-Mart in a posit where it' play catch-up withAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Wal-Mart ha gotten far more seriou about e-commerc in recent years, acquir Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3 billion, roll out an onlin groceri pick-up and deliveri service, and just recent launch free two-day ship in an effort to undercut Amazon Prime. But it remain well behind the e-commerc leader.Imag source: Wal-Mart.makeArticleAd();Wal-Mart' U.S. store busi is still perform well, produc a long streak of posit comparable-sal growth thank in part to initi like higher wage and better train for employees. But that busi will no doubt begin to feel pressur as onlin sale grow as a percentag of total retail sales. Profit have taken a dive as Wal-Mart invest in e-commerc and in-stor initiatives, and an earn recoveri will requir these invest to pay off in the long run.With the retail busi chang rapidly, is Wal-Mart stock a safe bet? And what about the dividend? With slump profits, is the quarterli payout at risk?A solid dividendWal-Mart ha not histor been a great dividend stock, in part becaus the stock price wa soar right along with the dividend prior to 2000. The yield wa consist below 1% until the mid-2000s, when the stock price began to stagnate. The yield ha steadili risen sinc then, current sit right around 3%.WMT Dividend Yield (TTM)data byYCharts.Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat, mean that it ha rais it dividend annual for at least 25 years. In Wal-Mart' case, the dividend ha been increas annual sinc the veri first payment in 1974. Thi long track record doesn't guarante that the dividend will continu to increas go forward, but it show that the compani ha been disciplin over the year in regard to capit allocation.Wal-Mart' current quarterli dividend is $0.50 per share, with a total annual payout of $2 per share. Base on it adjust earn guidanc for fiscal 2017, result for which the compani will report on Feb. 21, the payout ratio is current around 47%. Thi give Wal-Mart some breath room, even though earn will be down compar to previou years.Wal-Mart' dividend growth will like be slow as the compani divert it resourc to build out it e-commerc business. But I suspect that it will remain a dividend aristocrat for the forese future.Elev risksTh risk of futur profit declin is certainli higher today than it wa befor the compani need to care veri much about e-commerce. Not onli is there the threat of declin in-stor sale as consum shift online, but Wal-Mart is compet in e-commerc against a compani that ha been oper with razor-thin margins, and sometim no margin at all, sinc it founding.Amazon gener lower margin than Wal-Mart, but Amazon also spend prodigi on everyth from content for it stream servic to a $1.5 billion air hub to help shuttl around merchandise. Wal-Mart will almost certainli be more focus and disciplin with it e-commerc investments, which should help keep the bottom line intact.Th worst-cas scenario for Wal-Mart would be a failur to grow e-commerc sale rapidli despit it major invest coupl with declin in-stor sales. That scenario would almost certainli lead to earn stagnat or decline, eventu put the dividend at risk. The best-cas scenario, strong e-commerc sale growth and solid store performance, would eventu lead to earn growth.Wal-Mart stock trade for around 16 time the company' guidanc for full-year adjust earnings. That' not bargain territory, but it doe repres a discount to the overal market. Ani compani go through a major transit is inher risky, but it look like the step Wal-Mart is take are the right ones. Wal-Mart stock come with risks, but not nearli as mani as most other retailers.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, I constantli see investor fail to do so in the financi sector, which natur is sensit interest-r levels. In other words, when the Fed sound hawkish, bank stock (especi in thi environment) tend to pop. A dovish Fed ha a tendenc to lead to lower interest rates, and thu weigh on financials.And that bring me to our analysi of Well Fargo.WFC Stock ChartsLook at the multiyear weekli chart of Well Fargo shares, we see that the post-elect ralli thi past Novemb cleanli broke the stock back abov it 50-week (yellow) and 200-week (red) move averages.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteThi also coincid with a breakout of the big bull flag-lik pattern that I mark with the two purple-dot parallels.Click to EnlargeWFC stock then slip into a sideway pattern (mark by the blue box), which thu far thi week it ha margin broken out of to the upside.From thi angle, WFC stock now look pois to overtak it 2015 high and push toward $60 as a next upsid target (bar ani quick bearish reversal, of course).On the daili chart, we see that dure the two-month consolid phase, Well Fargo in mid- to late Januari and through earli Februari continu found support at it rise 50-day move averag (yellow).Click to EnlargeThi support ultim help WFC stock attempt a breakout of the consolid phase on Monday.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI'v said it before, and I'll say it again:Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will take over the world. While the gener public obsess over bad hair and the color orange, I think we face a bigger threat. Amazon' drone and their uncanni way of do busi will fundament alter commerc as we know it. Note that I didn't say ""e-commerce."" When you domin as much as AMZN stock has, your industri no longer requir a qualifi prefix.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnybodi that doubt that AMZN stock could hit the$1,000 marksimpli need to perus theircustom serviceoptions.If you ever encount an issu use Amazon, the compani will take care of you promptly. Should you need immediate, on the spot assistance, AMZN will take you to a special menu screen. From there, you enter your phone number, and liter within seconds, you will be direct to a compani representative.W all know firsthand how frustrat most custom servic experi are. I wouldn't be surpris if some compani deliber promot poor servic just so you won't call them. Thi of cours is just anoth reason whi Amazon stock is so special. They could rest on their laurels. They could kick back and relax, know that their statu as king is unchallenged. Yet they still have the same hunger that they did back in the late 1990s.Mayb that' whi AMZN stock is one of the greatest invest in history, while gener internet peersNetscapeandLycosarehistory.AMZN Stock Tee Up for An Explos 2017I can go on a full-blown rant list all the reason whi everi investor should at least consid Amazon stock, but a recent develop in the market realli solidifi the bullish argument. As you know, AMZN stock didn't do so well when Donald Trump won the gener elect on Nov. 8. Within a few days, share had fallen by as much as 9%. Thi is understand consid the bitter and contenti polit campaign season.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayEven by the end of 2016, AMZN stock wa conspicu lower than it pre-elect result close. However, that chang dramat at the start of the new year. Amazon stock gain some much-need traction, and shot abov the $800-mark. Sinc breach that psycholog barrier, AMZN ha yet to fall back below it. And for January, Amazon saw a robust 9% return.Thi is import becaus Januari is typic not a good time for Amazon stock. Of all the open month go back to 1998, share averag an extrem pedestrian 0.6%. However, annual return from 1998 through 2016 averag 84%.Such huge discrep made me wonder - are there indic in Januari that predict how AMZN stock will do later?Click to EnlargeTh answer is a resound yes.Thi past January' perform for AMZN stock wa the fourth best overall. Of the three other time that Amazon stock post better open months, investor later saw averag annual return of 120%. Inclus of everi posit January, AMZN still net an amaz averag annual return of 100%.That' not all. Of the seven year in which Amazon took a loss, six had Januari that also incur red ink. The one except occur in 2001, dure the immedi aftermath of the tech bubbl bursting. As long as Januari hold up, it' highli unlik to be on the lose end.Amazon' Fundament Look Great Too!I don't recommend make a decis on an opportun on the basi of a sole metric or indicator. The same can be said about statist data. Even the best-reason and logic calcul can't account for everi variable. Just like the elect of Presid Trump, there are certain element of unpredict that can and will bite you.Anoth Take - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?However, with AMZN stock, I think investor have a littl more buffer to play with thank to it solid fundamentals. Primarily, Amazon is still innovating. We saw a bit of that dure the Super Bowl commerci featur Amazon Prime Air. It' also a domin player in cloud computing, frustrat compani likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).And while I acknowledg it' riski for AMZN stock if it doesn't work out, I like Amazon' ventur into groceries. Granted, I'm not crazi on possibl rumor that the compani is think about roll out2,000 stores. But if they do thi right - particularli in trendi place like their Seattl hometown - AMZN could have anoth winner on it hands.Thes underli driver provid the confid for investor will to bet that Amazon stock will hit quadrupl digits. However, what can't be deni is the momentum. When AMZN get hot, it almost alway stay hot. For many, that will be the nudg they need to make their final decision.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani Minute12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenTh postWhi Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon.com Gives a New Clue About Prime Member Numbers;2/14/2017;"One ofAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) most close guard metric is how mani Amazon Prime member there are. For years, Amazon ha mere refer to it Prime member base as be in the ""ten of millions."" The compani ha use that languag sinc 2013, leav investor to specul where in the 20 million to 90 million rang the figur actual sits.But third-parti research firm are alway happi to suggest some estimates. Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) regularli put out estimates, with the most recent be from Octob 2016, peg Amazon' Prime member base at 65 million. Meanwhile, we know that Amazon should have at least66 millionPrim member by now, base on the growth rate and figur that Amazon ha disclos over the years.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Well, the compani ha final start to give clearer clue as to it Prime member base.Say more while still say nothingAmazon recent file it 2016 10-K, and for the first time it ha start disclos a new categori of sale call ""retail subscript services,"" which includ ""annual and monthli fee associ with Amazon Prime membership, as well as audiobook, e-book, digit video, digit music, and other subscript services."" Thi metric total $6.4 billion last year, and ha grown significantli over the past three years.Data source: Amazon 10-K. Chart by author.If we were to take the figur at face valu and do the super-compl math of divid sale by Prime' cost of $99 per year, that would impli about 64.5 million Prime members. But it' not so clear-cut for a few reasons.For starters, theaveragemembership fee is imposs to calculate. Amazon offer discount membership for students; Prime receiv regular promot that reduc the fee, like a Black Friday deal in 2016 that knock off $20; Prime is avail in mani countries, each with vari (and often lower) fee that are subject to volatil currenc translation; some member may pay monthli instead of yearly, which cost more ($132 instead of $99).Additionally, Amazon sell all sort of subscript that like fall into thi category, from digit content to dog food.Amazon also account for the Prime membership fee it collect in differ ways, alloc portion to product sale and servic sale while amort those amount over the subscript term; some of the revenu remain deferred, while the new metric onli includ recogn revenue. Anoth portion of the fee is even alloc as ship revenue.In other words, while Amazon' new disclosur around retail subscript revenu provid yet anoth data point for investor to scrutin and analyze, the compani ha done a good job of split up the alloc of Prime fee for account purpos in a way that still obfusc how mani Prime member there are. It' safe to say that membership are in the ballpark of 65 million to 70 million at thi point, and at the rate that Amazon is ad Prime members, it'll be less than two year until it chang it languag from a vagu ""ten of millions"" to a still-vagu ""over a hundr million.""Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

That slowdown wa mainli caus by a govern crackdown on mislead ad (especi for healthcar products) across it sites, aswap of it stakein onlin travel agencyQunarwith it rivalCtrip, and the overal slowdown of the Chines economy.But onc those headwind fade, Baidu' top line is expect to grow 20% in fiscal 2017. That growth will like be fuel by it invest in new and adjac markets, like O2O (online-to-offline) servic which integr new servic into it core mobil app, driverless vehicles, and artifici intelligence.Amazon' revenu rose 20% in fiscal 2015, 27% in fiscal 2016, and is expect to rise anoth 22% thi year. That consist growth can be attribut to the rapid growth of it core marketplac busi and the growth of AW (Amazon Web Services), the biggest cloud platform in the world. Dure fiscal 2016, AW revenu surg 55% and account for 9% of it top line -- compar to 7% in 2015.How profit are Baidu and Amazon?Most of Baidu' revenu come from ads, which have much higher margin than Amazon' main marketplac business. However, Baidu' oper margin have gradual declin over the past few years, due to the ramp up in it spend on O2O servic and other businesses.

Analyst expect AWS' top line growth and it steadi oper margin to boost it net earn by 49% thi year and 75% in fiscal 2018. That impress bottom line growth will give Amazon more freedom to use loss lead and low-margin strategi (like addit Prime services, Echo, Fire TV, Dash buttons) to expand it e-commerc ecosystem. However, investor should be awar that an ongo price battl in the cloud platform market ha forc AW to repeatedli lower it price -- so the unit' bottom line growth could still hit a few speed bump in the near future.What the valuat tell usBaidu trade at 14 time trail earnings, which is much lower than the industri averag of 50 for internet inform providers.

Don’t Buy Into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Until You Consider All Angles;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhen I look at the analysi of my fellow InvestorPlac colleagues, I see a recur pattern. They'r bullish onAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA), and exceedingli so. Dana Blankenhorn is on record say that BABA stock willhit all-tim highs. Jame Brumley believ that Alibaba stock willdo the impossible- outperformAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). I, on the other hand, am not too convinced.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThi isn't to say that I don't think those metric can't come true. For example, I can easili see a case where the Alibaba stock price hit an all-tim high. The market are in a care optimist mood right now. Presid Donald Trump, while still be the self-anoint king ofTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR), is say just the right words. Plus, theiShar FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (ETF)(NYSEARCA:FXI) is near double-digit year-to-date.Therefore, don't be surpris if BABA stock outduel AMZN for a few cycles.So what is my issu with Alibaba stock? There are two concern that I have: the first, a broader perspect that is rare discussed, and the second, the lack of technic enthusiasm.BABA stock Can Turn on a DimeLet' tackl the broader concerns, but to do that, I will need to wade into a polit sensit area. Sinc our kindergarten and elementari school years, we'v been taught that we are all the same. As we becom adults, we find that such platitud - while well-mean - are not veri helpful. Peopl are different. And Asian market are a lot differ than American or western markets. Becaus of this, compar BABA stock to an American counterpart is also not helpful.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowTh reason for thi is that the gambl cultur is so integr in Asian cultur that it' not realli defin as a social problem. Onli when Asian immigr come to the U.S., for example, dogambl behaviorsbecom quantifi as problems. Accord to numer Asian-American research interview byPsycholog Today, individu cultur throughout Asia activ promot a gambl ethos.What doe thi have to do with Alibaba stock? Investor need to be awar that BABA can make you rich, or it can make you poor in a hurry. Thi is especi true becaus we just saw a massiv collaps in the underli Chines markets. Sure, the benchmark FXI is up over 10% thi year. However, it' also down more than 23% from it 2015 highs.Plus, we'v alreadyseen thi showbefore. Back in the late 1980s, mani fear Japan would take over the world. Thi wa one of the subtl theme of Hollywood blockbust likeBlack Rain.Then the collaps happened, and Japanes market have never look the same. True, China and Japan have differ fundamentals, but it' worth consid when look at BABA stock.Alibaba Stock Isn'tThatImpressiveI will further argu that a correl exist between the Asian gambl cultur and Alibaba stock' technic performance.Consid the averag annual return of BABA. On paper, it' realli not that impressive. Between 2014 (which wa not a complet year) and 2016, the averag is a mere 1.2%. Peopl love BABA stock for it surg in momentum, but that' about it. As a prime example, share are up 15.5% YTD, but onli after drop 12% between Nov. 8 and the end of December.Click to EnlargeOverall, the histori of Alibaba stock isn't that favorable. On the day of it initi public offering, BABA stock close at $93.89. Presently, share are trade slightli over $101. That' just an 8% net profit after all thi time. The math is pretti clear - BABA is one choppi mess.In China and other Asian markets, they live for thi kind of volatility. In America and the West? Not so much.And if we'r in the busi of compar Chines stock to American stocks, consid Amazon' perform rel to where BABA is now. On it 605th day of trading, AMZN wa up almost 4,400% sinc it first close price. Of course, that wa smack dab in the middl of the tech bubble. But even dure the immedi aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, AMZN wa up more than 216% from it open drive.Know the Risk Befor Buy BABAThi lead me to ask an unavoid question. If Chines consum are truli ring up the cash regist for discretionari items, whi isn't BABA do better? They'v alreadi beaten their region rival likeJD.Com Inc(ADR)(NASDAQ:JD). Plus, everybodi ha present otherwis excel argument for it immin rise higher.Whi Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Still Need to Prove ItselfIf you were to hold BABA stock long-term, it realli didn't do you ani good. If you trade it, and trade it well, however, it' a differ story.Thi bring me to a sensit conclusion. When you talk about Alibaba stock, you have to look at it from all angles, especi the cultur one. BABA can work for you, but boy, you have to know what you'r get yourself into.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceut Stock to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveTh postDon't Buy Into Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Until You Consid All Anglesappear first onInvestorPlace."

Thi is despit the well-docu cost, effici and secur advantag of the Bitcoin payment network for both consum and busi alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-bas startup compani aim to chang thi through an effort to acceler the everyday use of Bitcoin for consum worldwide. Launch in May of 2016,iPayYoui an onlin platform and digit wallet that promot the viabil of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immedi saw earli success through a uniqu featur known as Pay-by-Twitt — the first onlin platform site for peer-to-p payment over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliv a caffein jolt to the retail sector, iPayY thi past Decemb introduc Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck (SBUX), a new way for coffe aficionado to pay for those espresso and other drink through the use of Bitcoin.Thi featur allow user to seamlessli transfer bitcoin from their exist iPayY Bitcoin wallet to their Starbuck mobil app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer befor prompt Bitcoin Direct to Starbuck to automat withdraw that amount from their iPayY account. Onc deposit into that person’ Starbuck account, purchas can be made via the mobil app at ani Starbuck location.Thi latest addit to the iPayY platform come on the heel of iPayYou’ recent gift card integration, allow Bitcoin to be use for instant gift card purchas from retail like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTun (AAPL).Thes creativ payment applic are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwid Director of Amazon Associates. With extens experi in the world of commerce, includ promin posit at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner develop iPayY with the intent of establish a easy-to-us Bitcoin wallet with simpl featur and low costs.Regard the strateg collabor with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader signific of thi move is that iPayY is abl to encourag Bitcoin to be spent in way that it creator intend — for everyday purchas from popular merchant without need a bank account to do so. Thi arrang with Starbuck allow coffe lover to replenish their primari Starbuck account with their Bitcoin holdings. We’v accomplish thi feat without Starbuck have to directli accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through thi demonstr Starbuck will soon begin accept Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In term of advantag for Starbuck regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not onli a great invest but is also becom quit use in everyday life. Becaus so mani of us are addict to coffee, be abl to use Bitcoin to purchas anyth at Starbuck is an enorm win for everyday consumers. And Starbuck will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin user who will now becom customers.”Ov time, Kavner believ that initi like thi will encourag merchant accept of Bitcoin. “Probabl the most import metric that everi merchant look at when decid what method of payment to accept is how mani new custom will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adopt of Bitcoin ha been the rel limit amount of peopl who want to use Bitcoin for PO transactions. Now, I believ that more and more will.”In term of what’ next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’r go to continu to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more use over 2017 and beyond. We are plan on expand to enabl more merchant adopt as well as ad mani featur that everi Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simpl to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin alreadi but for the everyday consum who may not even know what Bitcoin is. We’ll continu to innov to make Bitcoin easier and more use for everyone.”"

In a countri where consumpt of pirat content is rampant, Netflix need to get it price right befor anyon els in order to drive adopt of it service. Accord to a survey by Irdeto, 66% of poll custom watch pirat content in India, though 56% of them could be convinc to pay for content.Imag source: Netflix.However, whoever design Netflix' strategi seem to have forgotten the gap in the GDP per capita between India and the company' home market. Netflix price it basic monthli plan at INR 500 (roughli $7.50) -- almost equival to the price of the basic plan it charg in the U.S. The premium plan cost INR 800, almost $11.99 at the current exchang rate, which is ident to what Netflix charg in the U.S. However, India' GDP per capita wa just $1,750 in 2015, wherea the U.S. stand at about 30 time that. Netflix should have taken thi gap into consider as it current subscript plan limit it reach to wealthier audienc only.Then, there' the problem of slow internet speed and data costs. Accord toAkamai, India ha the slowest averag internet speed in Asia-Pacif at 3.5 Mbps. Additionally, consult firm Analysi Mason point out that an averag Indian custom spend 2.6% of her annual incom to pay for 1 GB of data a month. Thi is more than the 0.2% to 0.4% of annual incom custom in develop countri spend to get the same service.High internet cost and sluggish data speed make Netflix' subscript plan especi costli as custom will need to also spend money on a bigger data package. Most content consumpt in the countri will take place on smartphones, but an averag smartphon in India gener just 559 MB of data each month in 2016, which a Netflix stream would consum in just 90 minutes. Therefore, to consum more Netflix content, a user will have to buy more data and shell out more money abov and beyond subscript costs.Amazon and Hotstar are eat Netflix' lunchNetflix need to think about India from a longer-term perspective, as mobil data consumpt in the countri is expect to grow at a rapid pace. TheEricssonMobl Report indic that India' mobil data consumpt will grow to 7 GB per smartphon in 2021 thank to a drop in data cost and the growth of high-spe networks.Th compani need to keep it subscript cost low until data cost in India go down. Unfortunately, Netflix fail to do so and is now lose the market to the like of Amazon and Hotstar, who have kept their price significantli lower.Amazon launch Prime Video in India in Dec. 2016, and the compani sell it as a part of the Prime package, which cost INR 499 (approxim $7.46) annually. Therefore, Amazon' annual subscript can be had for the same amount a custom would pay for a month of Netflix. Even if Amazon rais it Prime membership to INR 999 a year (approxim $15), as expected, it would still be much cheaper than Netflix' annual cost.What' more, Amazon doe not discrimin in the video qualiti it provid to customers. User can enjoy both HD and ultra HD for a flat subscript fee at Amazon, while Netflix charg a premium for each category. Amazon also provid expedit deliveri and earli access to deal as a part of the Prime package, give custom good valu for their money.Whil Amazon is beat Netflix on pricing, Twenty-First Centuri Fox' Hotstar is beat Netflix on content -- especi sports. Hotstar' premium subscript is price at just INR 199 (just under $3) a month, though there is a free model as well that give delay access to content and also carri advertisements.In fact, Hotstar is the top video stream app in India accord to App Annie, with Amazon Prime and Netflix occupi fifth and ninth positions, respectively. There are two key factor work in Hotstar' favor: strong local content and sports. Sinc Hotstar is under the umbrella of India' biggest televis hous -- Star TV -- it ha good access to local content such as popular TV show from local channels.Mor importantly, Hotstar give user access to live sport as a part of it subscript plan, which is a key differenti for it compar to Amazon and Netflix. The app give user access to a wide rang of sport from cricket to footbal to tennis, along with HBO show such asSilicon ValleyandGam of Thrones.Thi divers content, along with reason pricing, is one of the major reason for Hotstar' success in the region, while Netflix is lack on both of those fronts. Thi is whi a new entrant such as Amazon, which launch almost a year after Netflix, is alreadi in a better position.Unless Netflix adapt it busi model for the Indian market, it won't find as much success in the countri as it ha in so mani other markets. The competit will continu to leav it behind, which should be caus for concern sinc India' onlin video subscrib are expect to exceed 100 million by 2020 (from just 12 million in 2014).10 stock we like better than NetflixWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It charg a monthli fee for it core service. On top of that, it offer addit servic such as payment process and shipping, for which it take a cut of each sale.Shar of Shopifi are up about 27% sinc the compani report it third-quart earn results. The share price is now trade around it all-tim high. Investor are expect strong result from the company, whose revenu growth ha been huge, but which ha yet to turn a profit. Here' what investor should expect from Shopify' fourth-quart earnings.makeArticleAd();Data source: YCharts.Analyst expect and Shopify' outlookTh consensu on the Street is that Shopifi brought in around $121.69 million in revenu for the fourth quarter. That' on the high end of management' rang of $120 million to $122 million.Analyst expect that revenu to translat into a $0.02 loss per share. That' also in line with management' outlook for an adjust oper loss of $1 million to $3 million. Shopifi also provid a GAAP outlook of $10 million to $12 million in oper loss for the quarter.But Shopifi ha consist outperform it revenu outlook over the past year.QuarterOutlookActualQ4 2015$59 million-$61 million$70.2 millionQ1 2016$65 million-$67 million$72.7 millionQ2 2016$79 million-$81 million$86.6 millionQ3 2016$93 million-$95 million$99.6 millionQ4 2016$120 million-$122 million?Data source: Shopifi quarterli reportsGiven Shopify' histori of conserv outlooks, the Street may be underestim the company' fourth-quart results. It wouldn't be a huge surpris if Shopifi onc again beat analysts' expectations.Imag source: ShopifyKey metric to watchTher are sever import oper metric for investor to pay attent to. First and foremost is the company' total merchants. The number pass 325,000 in the third quarter, up from 200,000 the year before.In the fourth quarter last year, Shopifi ad around 43,000 new merchants, an extrem strong quarter. Manag said thi year' fourth quarter will be strong onc again, but it temper expectations, note that it report mileston throughout the year (e.g., 325,000) instead of exact numbers. Depend on when it pass those mileston within the quarter, it could make fourth-quart addit look smaller.Anoth factor to pay attent to is the split between subscript solut revenu and merchant solut revenue. Subscript revenu is driven by the grow number of merchant on the platform, and it' grow more slowli than merchant solut revenue. Merchant solut (payment processing, shipping, and the like) should surpass subscript revenu in the fourth quarter, especi consid retail sale tend to increas dure the holidays.It' worth note that merchant solut revenu carri a lower margin than subscript revenue, so Shopifi may experi some margin pressure. Ultimately, however, wide adopt of merchant solut from it merchant should support subscript solut as it make the product stickier for Shopify' customers.On last metric to consid is gross merchandis volum and what percentag of that volum is process through Shopifi Payments. Dure the third quarter, GMV reach $3.8 billion and Shopifi Payment process $1.5 billion, or 39%. Befor that, Shopifi didn't provid exact detail but note on it second-quart report that ""the percentag of GMV process through Shopifi Payment continu to grow,""Qualit updat from managementIn addit to those key metrics, investor should watch for management' commentari on it recent deal to integr withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) marketplace, further strengthen Shopify' partnership with the retail giant. The new deal make it easier for Shopifi merchant to list their product on Amazon. Amazon previous shut down it Amazon Webstor servic and sent it user to Shopify.Imag source: ShopifyInvestor should also look for comment on the continu growth of Shopifi Plus, it enterprise-level e-commerc solution. Ani updat on the progress of Shopifi Ship and Shopifi Capit -- two high-margin product -- could be valuabl as well.Overall, Shopifi look set to produc yet anoth earn beat, but the stock is price as though the market expect as much. Anyth short could hurt the stock price, but depend on what caus the shortfall, some pullback in the stock could present a long-term buy opportunity.10 stock we like better than ShopifyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Netflix is My Biggest Stock Holding -- and That Isn't Changing Any Time Soon;2/13/2017;"Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ: NFLX) is by far my largest holding. Not becaus it' the one I invest the most in -- far from it. I onli invest 1.5% of my origin invest fund in Netflix. It ha sinc grown to an astound 20% of my portfolio thank to 3,000% gains. Some might argu that is too much to have ride on a singl compani and would'v sold off some of the posit to lock-in those gains.Not me. Even after the massiv run the stock ha gone on, I see a busi with sever big growth opportun that can meaning move the needle.makeArticleAd();Netflix avail across all your devices. Imag source: Netflix, Inc.Netflix wa my first invest back in 2007, just as the compani wa introduc it onlin streaming. I wa one of the disillus custom of Blockbust -- now own byDISH-- that found Netflix a coupl of year earlier, when I wa charg $40 in late fee for a movi that I could have purchas for $20. I cut up my Blockbust card, join Netflix and never look back. I saw then what I see now: a compani that is provid an unbeat servic at a reason price. I love the programming, my person deal with it custom servic have been seamless, and these experi as a consum (plu some big busi levers) have made me a more confid investor.Readi to take on the worldIn addit to provid a great custom experience, Netflix ha a larg un-tap pool of potenti customers. It total address market, base on fixed-lin broadband subscrib is estim at 765 million home worldwide. Thi number is expect to grow to 925 million by 2020. Even exclud an estim 300 million potenti custom in China, a countri Netflix itself admit would be difficult to enter, the company' address market could exceed 625 million potenti custom within three years.Netflix avail in 200 countri -and in Portuguese! Imag source: Netflix, Inc.Within it US market, the number of household is estim at 125 million, of which Netflix count 49 million subscribers, for a penetr rate of about 40%. If it were to achiev that level of penetr in the rest of the world -- even exclud China -- paid subscrib could grow more than 2.5 time from it current level of 94 million to 240 million worldwide. Thi exclud potenti market increas from popul gain and further broadband penetration.Economi of scale at playLet' not forget decreas increment costs, which is the cost of ad each addit subscriber. Onc Netflix ha built out it librari of stream content, a greater portion of the revenu from each addit subscrib will drop to the bottom line. Netflix ha been hard at work grow it portfolio of self-produc origin programs. It plan to spend $6 billion in 2017 up from $5 billion in 2016. In it most recent sharehold letter, it state ""it is clear to us that high qualiti content travel well across borders."" The abil to spread the cost of it content across an ever-grow base of global custom produc economi of scale not avail to tradit linear TV broadcasters.Amaz origin contentNetflix plan to have it self-produc origin eventu account for half of the platform' content. At Goldman Sach 25th Annual Communacopia Confer on Septemb 20, 2016 CFO David Well indic that the compani wa still a coupl of year away from that goal, estim that it is one-third to halfway there. Netflix first began debut exclus origin content in 2013 as a way to differenti it offerings. Mani of those show have becom wildli popular. New season of some of it earliest releas are still enthral viewer includingHous of CardsandOrang is the New Black.

Other offer includingStrang ThingsandMak A Murdererhav becom cultur phenomenons. The calib of these offer ha put the industri on notic that Netflix is a forc to be reckon with and bolster the strength of the platform.Netflix ha plan for half it librari to be self-produc origin content. Imag source: Netflix, Inc.It could still all go sidewaysWhat could go wrong? Plenty. Cash burn could overwhelm the video purveyor. Even by it own estimates, it will produc neg cash flow of $2 billion in 2017, up from $1.7 billion in 2016. Additionally, competit is heat up in the space.Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) announc in Decemb that it had expand it compet stream servic to 200 countries. The e-commerc giant is one of the few compani with the resourc to compet with Netflix on a global level. Finally, worldwid growth estim may be too aggressive. Netflix virtuou cycl onli work as it continu to add new members. If that growth stall befor the build-out is complete, it could come crash down.Mi money is where my mouth isEven in the face of those potenti challenges, my money is still on Netflix. I think Netflix ha execut it plan nearli flawlessly, itsQwikst debaclenotwithstanding. The worldwid expans is on track and the compani veri rare miss it own intern financi and subscrib growth estimates. That, plu the success of it origin content, prove to me that Netflix is compani that is connect to it customers.So long as the result keep prove that, I don't plan on sell ani time soon.Find out whi Netflixi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Can Always Brush Things Off;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI won't sit here and tell you that I have ani idea what a reason valuat forAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) should be. I mean, I have SOME idea, but see how nobodi els realli ha ani idea, I may as well throw darts. AMZN stock tend to move in big chunk base on big news, such as an earn report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEven though Amazon stock miss estim when it report last week, and the stock got whacked, I say it mean noth becaus there is no hard-and-fast way to valu AMZN stock. Without that centralized, normal metric as a baseline, it is difficult to interpret what the earn report actual mean except in a gener sense.Nevertheless, I'll try.First, the market got tie in knot over Amazon miss revenu estimates. Revenu wa $43.74 billion, which fell short of the $44.68 billion total. Gasp. Web Servic revenu fell $64 million short, come in at $3.536 billion. Doubl gasp. Q1 guidanc wa for $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion, short of $35.95 billion expected.Th sky is falling.Whi AMZN Stock Isn't Realli in Ani TroubleOf course, nobodi mention that AMZN actual turn in a $749 million profit, up 55% from the previou year. Web Servic had oper incom of $926 million compar to $580 million last year and that account for almost three-fourth of Amazon' total oper income. Mind you, the loss in it intern e-commerc unit blew up to $487 million from a loss of $108 million the year before.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenSee, AMZN stock realli is differ from ani other stock becaus it is basic take huge chunk of cash and free cash flow and invest in a very-long-term infrastructur and servic plan.Amazon is constantli invest in and beef up it Prime service, which variou sourc put at 65 million subscrib (Bezo won't say). Thi doesn't mean just the techi stuff like Price Reading, Audibl Channel and Twitch, but the hub of Prime: free 2-day delivery.That' where the rub is from an expens standpoint. AMZN stock ad 18 more citi to Prime service, which mean more infrastructur to support those cities, like warehous and labor and transport. The compani need fulfil centers. That' whi it' build a $1.5 billion new airport hub in Cincinnati.Then we can add in the invest in Amazon Fresh, which also requir ton of infrastructur to support, and it expans into India.Spend, spend, spend in order to grow, grow, grow.What' so bizarr and differ is that most compani would - after more than 20 year in busi - have predict earn and growth. Except Amazon is tri to take over the world, and Bezo isn't worri about profit becaus he ha ton of cash flow. Thi is veri John Malon of him, and we know how success Malon ha been, even as predict earnings-per-shar for ani of hi zillion track stock is equal impossible.Thus, a revenu miss mean noth to me. We'r in the top of the third inning.Bottom Line on Amazon StockStill, can we valu Amazon stock at all? Well, ye … sort of.Tak Enterpris Value-to-EBITDA ratio: AMZN stock trade at about 30.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) trade at 24.Wal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT) trade at 7.7.Liberti Interact Corp(NASDAQ:QVCA, NASDAQ:QVCB) trade at 8.4. So on thi basis, AMZN stock is crazi expensive.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuabl Than You ThinkOn a price-to-sal basis, Amazon stock trade at 2.9. The other stock abov trade at 14, 0.43 and 0.88, respectively. So AMZN stock is arguabl expens by thi metric as well.How about return on equity? Thi is the amount of net incom that is return as a percentag of sharehold equity. Amazon is at 14.52%. For FB, WMT, and QVCA, return on equiti is 19.76%, 18.46% and 11.67%. In thi case, AMZN fall in the middle.Ultimately, that' whi I prefer to sell nake put on Amazon stock that are far out of the money and expir month down the line. I make a littl money with much less risk.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter. As of thi writing, ha no posit in ani stock mentioned.

The Simple Concept Underlying U.S. Bancorp's Dominance;2/13/2017;"Even if you compareU.S. Bancorp(NYSE: USB) to the best in the bank business, it still domin the competition. For seven consecut years, it ha rank first among big bank in term of return on equity, the preemin profit metric in the industry.I'v studi U.S. Bancorp over the year in an effort to figur out how it doe thi -- especi how it doe so year in and year out. The short answer is that the Minneapolis-bas bank is highli efficient, spend a smaller share of it revenu on oper expens each year than even the notori efficientWel Fargo.Data source: Quarterli earn reports. Chart by author.makeArticleAd();But there' more to U.S. Bancorp' perenni outperform than just this. Effici is a necessari but not suffici condit of domin in the bank industry. A bank must be effici to outperform it peers, in other words, but effici alon doesn't captur the whole picture. It instead mere ignit and acceler what may best be describ of as a forc of nature, akin to the law of compound returns.Jim Collin in hi bookGood to Greatanalog thi forc of natur to a flywheel. It take effort to get the wheel spinning, and more effort to make it go faster, but at a certain point, Collin notes, there' a breakthrough when the law of physic take over:Th momentum of the thing kick in in your favor, hurl the flywheel forward, turn after turn . . . whoosh! . . . it own heavi weight work for you. You'r push no harder than dure the first rotation, but the flywheel goe faster and faster. Each turn of the flywheel build upon the work done earlier, compound your invest of effort. A thousand time faster, then ten thousand, than a hundr thousand. The huge heavi disk fli forward, with almost unstopp momentum.No compani illustr the power of thi concept better thanAmazon.com, which, as Brad Stone write inTh Everyth Store, incorpor Collins' flywheel into it oper philosophi more than a decad and a half ago.In Amazon' version, a low-cost structur enabl the e-commerc giant to offer lower price than it competitors. Lower price lead to happier customers, which lead to higher traffic on it website. Higher traffic encourag new seller to join Amazon' marketplace, which increas selection. And a better select improv the custom experience, which power a new revolut of the flywheel.Th Virtuou Cycle, as drawn by Amazon. Imag source: Amazon.Although Amazon and U.S. Bancorp are veri differ companies, the flywheel concept work in a similar way for the $446 billion bank. In fact, given the uniqu dynam of banking, it may be an even more power forc in the financi servic arena.Bi oper more effici than it peers, U.S. Bancorp can underpric them in the credit space. Thi attract high-qual borrowers, boost loan volum and reduc loan losses. The latter keep a lid on credit cost and therebi enabl U.S. Bancorp to be even more competit with respect to loan term on the next revolut of the flywheel. It also buttress the bank' debt rating, which keep it interest expens low and thu act as ad accelerant. Hold all els equal, then, with each turn of the flywheel, U.S. Bancorp should widen it competit advantag over it peers.Thi chain of event isn't just theoretical. Here' U.S. Bancorp Chairman and CEO Richard Davi connect the dot between it low-cost debt and heighten price power on a confer call with analyst in 2015:[Our best in class debt ratings] allow us to benefit from pricing. And again, thi is an audienc that understand this, but if we'r go to the market and we can receiv five-year money at a 40 to 60 basi point benefit from our peer group, that' five year we get to price thing better by 40% to 60% -- basi point and/or at least take half of it and put it into price. We onli deal with high-qual customers, so we'r not use it for subprim or near-prim purposes. We'r use it for the best custom to win them and keep them, but we'r unabash about say that we'll use price as a tool at thi moment in time.A I'v demonstratedin the past, moreover, there' a clear correl between effici ratio and loan loss among the nation' biggest banks. Thi follow from the fact that less effici bank must stretch for yield in their loan portfolio in order to gener the double-digit return on equiti earn by more effici banks. And becaus higher yield reflect higher risk, less effici bank tend to write off a larger share of their loan portfolio dure recess such as the one follow the financi crisi eight year ago.Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Chart by author.Th irregular but not infrequ undul of the credit cycl further acceler this, as bank that play fast and loos with credit risk are more like to fail when the economi take a turn for the worse. And even short of insolvency, a bank that take larg loan loss in a downturn is in no posit to pick up it less prudent peer for penni on the dollar when they run into trouble, which is one of the most effect way to grow a bank and maxim return over the long run.What all of thi mean is that U.S. Bancorp should continu to outperform it peer in the year ahead. It stock isn't cheap, and Davi is retir later thi year, but I don't believ that either of these alter the invest thesi underli it stock.10 stock we like better than US BancorpWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google's Biggest Cloud Customer Just Signed a $1 Billion Deal With Amazon;2/12/2017;"It didn't take long for Google' biggest cloud custom to split it allegiances. Just a week afterSnap(NYSE: SNAP) announc it sign a $2 billion five-year contract with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company, it sign a $1 billion contract with Google' biggest cloud competitor --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Snap will continu to use Googl Cloud for the core Snapchat functionality. The Amazon Web Servic contract is for ""redund infrastructur support of our busi operations,"" accord to Snap'samend S-1filing.Th new file also reveal Snap ha been use Amazon for nearli a year, so not much will chang in the near term. But the way Snap' contract is structur with Amazon, it could be spend nearli as much on AW five year from now as it is on Googl Cloud.makeArticleAd();It' worth take a closer look at Snap' cloud contracts.

That might chang in five years. While Amazon just provid redund for Snapchat to ensur the app doesn't suffer signific downtim right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That' evid by the ramp in minimum obligations.Googl still ha a big advantag over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google' Cloud Platform. Transit to anoth cloud provid ""would be difficult to implement, and may caus us to incur signific time and expense,"" it said in it S-1. What' more, Snap built Snapchat use the tool avail on Google,"" some of which do not have an altern in the market,"" accord to it prospectus.But if Snap want to expand to China, where Googl doesn't operate, it'll have to rework thing on anoth cloud provider, anyway. Consid the grow size of Snap' cloud spending, Amazon may be abl to offer tool compar to what it use on Googl to help facilit a transition.Google' cloud busi is minuscul in comparison to Amazon's. Snap' $400 million per year contract veri like made it Google' biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon' go to steal away a good chunk of it business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- it cloud busi brought in $12 billion last year -- but it mean a whole lot to Google.What thi mean for SnapSnap is now commit $3 billion to cloud servic over the next five years. That' a lot for a compani with onli $405 million in annual revenue, even one grow as quickli as Snap.At some point, it would make more sens for Snap to build out it own infrastructur like other popular internet services. Build infrastructur is capit intensive, but onc it' built, the compani would no longer be as reliant on third parti to support it flagship app. With Snap lock into contract for the next five years, it' unlik we'll see it go that way anytim soon, which mean continu pressur on it gross margin.Last year, Snap' cost of revenu exceed sales. The bulk of it cost of revenu wa attribut to it cloud infrastructur expenses, which climb $192 million last year. As such, Snap post a neg gross margin, which is crazi for a compani that primarili produc software.Bi 2021, Snap will be pay at least $750 million for cloud services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-comput custom in the world.

As it retail sale grow by more than 20% a year, it seem logic that the compani will have to take more of it logist under it control.However, as Amazon' sale have skyrocket so too have it ship costs. Those expens reach $16.2 billion last year, a 40% increas from the year befor and account for nearli all of the company' $17.6 billion in fulfil expenses, it biggest line item after cost of sales, or what Amazon pay for the good it sells.

That wa the fastest growth in net ship cost sinc 2011.Let' take a closer at Amazon' ship cost to see what investor can expect in the come years.Ship ain't easyAmazon ha step up effort to make ship even faster and more conveni for it customers.

Amazon announc it would invest an addit $3 billion on the subcontin last year, and CEO Jeff Bezo ha order hi deputi to ""do what it takes"" to win the Indian market, where the compani face stiff competit from China'sAlibabaand nativ player Snapdeal and FlipKart.What make India so specialIndia present a uniqu e-commerc opportun for sever reasons. The countri current ha 1.3 billion people, about four time the popul of the U.S., and is on track to surpass China as the world' most popul countri in just five years, accord to the U.N.It economi is grow 5% annually. Much of the popul is tech-savvy, with smartphon penetr reach more than 30%, make it the world' second-biggest smartphon market after China. About 10% of Indian speak English, give it the second-largest English-speak popul after the U.S., and thu make it an ideal market for Amazon Video, which the compani launch intern at the end of 2016. Finally, India is dens populated, with 1,033 peopl per squar mile, compar to the U.S., which ha just 85 peopl per square, and it retail industri is highli fragmented, without domin entrench brand occupi posit similar to whatWal-Mart, for example, hold in the U.S.Thos two factor make the countri an ideal market for an e-commerc oper like Amazon. The high popul densiti mean ship would be much easier and cheaper than in the U.S., especi if the compani can master drone delivery, and the highli fragment natur of the retail sector make the benefit of e-commerc even more desir and the competit weaker.What is the compani doing?In 2014, Amazon announc a $2 billion invest in India and follow that with anoth $3 billion last year for a total of $5 billion. Due to Indian regulations, Amazon oper onli a marketplac in India, sell good through third-parti vendors, but it handl the technolog infrastructur and most of it vendors' deliveries. Build out it own deliveri network, as oppos to reli onUPSor the Postal Servic as it doe domestically, is costly. Amazon also seem to have learn lesson from China, where it fail to adapt significantli to the local market and fell well behind the competition.Th compani step up it effort on the subcontin in Decemb when it launch it video stream servic as part of Prime, for an annual fee of just $15. Amazon is offer a one-year trial for half that price, just $7.50, a notabl contrast withNetflix, which launch it servic global at roughli the same $10-a-month price tag the compani charg in the U.S., as it say it' target elit rather than offer a mass-market product. Amazon, as usual, is content to grab market share now and worri about profit later.Play the long gameAmazon isn't the onli one pay attent to the Indian market, of course.Appleha also notic a big opportunity, and it' increasingli tout it growth in India on it earn call -- smartphon shipment grew 18% in the countri in 2016, and it sold 2.5 million iPhon there.Amazon ha alway been will to play the long game, invest for the long term is one of Bezos' core mantras, and he promis hi first sharehold as much. The Indian e-commerc market is still small, but it' grow fast: Sale more than doubl from $6.3 billion in 2014 to $16 billion in 2015. If Amazon can repeat it perform in the U.S., where it control about one quarter of e-commerc sales, it Indian oper could be huge in just a few years.Th compani doe not break out result by country, but it invest abroad are appar from it financi statements. While oper incom spike in North America and in Amazon Web Servic last year, it intern oper loss widen from $699 million to $1.28 billion, evid of invest like those it is make in India.Though it will be sever year at least until Amazon gener a profit in the region, the compani is make the right move by invest heavili in the subcontinent. It size and growth make it a uniqu opportun for the company, and Amazon ha shown time and again that it recogn the wisdom of break into an emerg market early.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBack when I wa a kid, a half-centuri ago, most peopl saw onli three TV network - CBS, NBC and ABC.makeArticleAd();Source:Flash.pro via Flickr (modified)If you'r old enough to rememb the DuMont network, pleas check outmi recent galleri on dividend stocksthat provid solid retir income. If you think ofTwenty-First Centuri Fox Inc(NASDAQ:FOXA) as the fourth network, read on.A quarter-centuri ago, when my children were small, a host of cabl network rose to challeng the broadcast network for viewers. It wa the age of""57 channel and noth on""with ESPN, the USA Network, CNN, the Weather Channel and the Food Network all have their heyday.Ov time, the broadcast bought out most of the new operators, sometim after be bought themselves.CB Corporation(NYSE:CBS) now own Showtim and the Smithsonian Network.Comcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA), the parent of NBC, own all or part of a dozen networks, includ CNBC, Syfi and USA.Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), the parent of ABC, own ESPN, the biggest franchis of all, and the Disney networks. And Fox, which grew up in thi era, ha clone for nearli all of them.But in the 2010s, a new forc ha arisen to challeng the network owners, a forc they will find difficult to compet with and almost imposs to buy.That forc is stream services, which deliv their show to your TV, over the internet through plug-in dongl rather than set-top box - unless you prefer view on a PC, tablet or phone. These offer all the entertain a TV zombi might ever need, and the servic can cost less than $10 per month, much less than a cabl service. They don't have schedules, so you watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it.Stream through the internet is the futur of TV, and we are just at it dawn. It' still unclear how we will discov shows, how we will interfac with what we want to watch or how much we'll eventu pay for the privileg of watching. But cable, at least as we knew it, is drift away, as broadcast televis previous drift away. It will continu to exist, as broadcast does, just in a smaller, truncat form.What is the futur of live event in the new world? Is TV even go to remain a one-way, passiv medium? We don't know.In addit to be better, and cheaper, for viewers, the new TV environ right now look great for entertain and show producers, who suddenli have a host of new option on where and how to sell their wares, which they'r use to gain new creativ freedom if not new wealth.But the new media landscap is a lot less stabl than the old one and, given the wealth of choic available, it may prove much less lucr for stars, writer and producers.Just a few year into the new era, moreover, it' appar that the new stream compani are big enough to regard the cabl networks' owner as minnows. Thi is not a problem the network can buy their way out of, as they bought out of cable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowYour mission, as an investor, is to examin the new TV stock and decid whether to invest your money in them. And along the way, you will be buy a lot more than TV.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixTh busi model of the new TV era wa creat byNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).A decad ago, Netflix wa a rel small but interest compani that mail DVDs. You paid a monthli fee to hold a few, then got more when you sent them back. It wa a rel simpl busi base on physic media, but it had potential.Bi simpli move that busi model online,us cloud servic and open-sourc technology, Netflix now deliv unlimit amount of content to viewer as a stream, rather than on a disk.Cofound Reed Hast ha transform TV as no one ha sinc Ted Turner. If you bought Netflix when it went public in 2002, your $1 invest is now worth $137.Hasting' second big innovation, which came on the heel of the stream busi model, wa tostart fund hi own programmingrath than just resel exist movi and TV shows. Hi string of hit began withHous of Cards, base on a British mini-series, which by itself made hi monthli $8 per month subscript fee seem a bargain.Netflix offer it sharehold low profit margins, but great growth. Between 2013 and 2016, revenu doubled, from $4.37 billion to $8.83 billion, and profit nearli followed, from 26 cent per share to 43 cents. Along the way, the compani ha increas it debt dramat - it now repres about one-fourth of asset - to pay for it deliveri infrastructur and to obtain new program assets, which it is assum will retain their valu over time. (Your grandkid will watchHous of Cardsth way your kid now watchM*A*S*H.)With a market cap of $62 billion, Netflix could now buy other TV stocks, like CBS. It valu exce that of Fox. ABC and NBC are protect from a Netflix acquisit by deep-pocket parents, Disney and Comcast. HBO, a subscript servic base on cable, will be protect in the same way onc parentTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) is bought byAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T).NFLX retain it valu as an invest becaus ofit intern operations, which by the fourth quarter of 2016 repres around 40% of the total and continu to grow. In the last three month of 2016 alon the compani ad 7.05 million new members, after forecast it would add just 5.2 million. Netflix' growth is accelerating, and it abil to buy must-se program is grow with it.Th problem for Netflix is that the cloud provid on which it success rest have seen what it ha done. They'r on to the trick. A network today isn't necessarili just a provid of content, but the scale infrastructur necessari to provid that content. The owner of cloud network and vast internet network are copi what Netflix does.Thes challeng have more zero in their asset base than those NFLX ha face before. Onc more, Reed Hast is a minnow in a sea of sharks.Everyth about the industri ha changed, but whether Netflix can ride the changes, or whether it will eventu be bought out as Turner was, remain up for debate.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockThereisa price cheaper than Netflix' $8 per month for all-you-can-eat entertain - the noth extra I payAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to access it video as a Prime member.It is true that you can buy Amazon Prime Video, separately,for $8.99 per month. But that' silli sinc the regular price for Prime, which includ free two-day ship on most Amazon items, is $99 per year (about $8.25 per month).Lately, Amazon ha also been outperform Netflix on the award front. In addit to11 Golden Globe nomin thi year alone, there are six Oscar nomin forManchest by the Sea(Amazonpaid $10 million for the distribut rightsa year ago).Frankli there is so much free stuff on Amazon (which I can watch on a big screen with my Fire Stick, a wireless dongl that fit on the side of the TV, connect to the internet via WiFi, and support a host of other servic includ Netflix) that I don't need anyth else. Were it not for live sports, I would kill my cabl in a heartbeat, and as my favorit sport signstream contracts, that motiv is disappear as well.And it' not just TV either. I'm fortun enough to have a wife who hate TV. She read instead. Amazon' Kindl Unlimited, for anoth $99 per year, becam fantast over the last year as more author have sign up and Amazon' algorithm have gotten better at anticip what peopl might want to borrow next from it vast library.Mi son doesn't watch TV either. He' a gamer, and ha been for years. He is constantli talk aboutTwitch, which offer live stream of peopl play video games. I don't get it, but Amazon does. They paid $970 million for Twitchlast March, make them partner with charact such as Bunnyfufu, who stream their gamingon Twitch.Lik most people, I watch veri few cabl channels. Cancel cabl and there is $100-150 per month I can pay for whatev program I want. There are onli so mani hour in a day - who need hundr of channel with noth on when a stream servic (or mayb two) can meet my needs?If I sound like an Amazon fanboy, it' becaus I am. As previous noted, my TV ha an Amazon Fire Stick plug into it, and I use a Fire tablet for reading. I also start accumul Amazon share in 2014, at an averag price of $330. They'r now worth about $800, and they'r a bargain at that price.For the fourth quarter of 2016 Amazon earn $749 million, $1.54 per share, on revenu of$43.741 billion. It is make the turn from a compani invest in front of growth to one that start earn profit regularly. It cloud operation, Amazon Web Services, now bring one-quart of it $3.5 billion in quarterli revenu to the bottom line - and one of it custom is Netflix.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayImagine. Amazon creat infrastructur that let other compani make money, then compet with it custom to make even more money with the same infrastructure. I recent dump share befor earnings, at $832 per share, becaus they had becom such a huge portion of my retir account.I may have to buy them back.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockNetflix may have creat the new busi model and Amazon may have perfect it, but the technolog began atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with Googl and YouTube.On of YouTube' co-found say the idea start afterth Janet Jackson ""wardob malfunction""at the 2004 Super Bowl. They just couldn't find ani video of it, and so ask other to upload it so they could see it. The servic wa an immedi sensation, and Google' purchas of the site for $1.65 billion wa just the beginning.Th busi model wa simple. Peopl upload videos, peopl watch videos. Googl place ad in front of the videos, and share some of the revenu with those who upload the videos. Like Googl itself, it is a free service, although it now ha a paid version call YouTub Red.YouTubedid not make a profit for it parentuntil after Amazon and Netflix got going. It is now estim to be bring in$10 billion per year, grow at 40% per year, with 80% of view outsid the U.S. By 2020 that will mean$27 billionin revenu per year. It audienc is tilt toward young people, age 18-34, the kind advertis most covet, and a grow percentag access it via phone or tablets.An analysi from STL Partner indic YouTube' profit contribut is mainli indirect. It traffic help Googl get the best price for internet bandwidth. It meta data is contribut to other Googl services. It give Googl a place at the tablewhenev video copyright issuesar discussed.Veteran TV produc Susann Daniel join Googl in 2015, and is charg withgrow the YouTub Red service. She is not onlybuy TV showsand makinga splash at movi festivalsbut aim to take veteran TV host likeConan O'Brien online. (Chelsea Handler ha alreadi move to Netflix.) Daniel is help by continu sale ofChromecast, a TV stream devic which compet with the Appl Fire StickYouTub ha creat it own stars, most of whom are unknown to their parents' generation. The most popular YouTub celebrity, PewDiePie, drew $15 million in incom last year and hadalmost 50 million viewers.Bi take advantag of Google' low-cost infrastructure, YouTub ha carv out a uniqu nich for itself in the new TV universe, one that is subsid it entranc into more ""traditional"" area like YouTub Red subscriptions.Thank to Amazon' purchas of Twitch, TV stock Googl and Amazon are now on a collis cours in the world of stream video. Custom of both will be the big winners, but stockhold should do well, too.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Appl (AAPL)Source:via AppleAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) wa a latecom to TV stream in the cloud.Appl began ramp up spend for it own cloud onli a few year ago,invest $15 billion in 2016 aloneto build a global network of cloud data center and, potentially, a place for itself in the new industry.Th money wa spent mainli to serv exist paid Appl services, like the sale apps, iCloud storag and iTunes, which are nowbigg profit driver than the Macintosh or iPad. CEO Tim Cook said in hi most recent earn call that Appl Servic brought in$7.17 billionin the Decemb quarter alone, which he expect will doubl by 2020.Apple' stream busi is distinguish from that of Googl becaus it consist of paid subscribers, and distinguish from Amazon and Netflix by be primarili fee-for-servic rather than subscript revenue.Whil iPhon sale are stagnating, Appl ha found a new growth engin in services, and built a platform to challeng the other stream players. Appl Music now ha about21%of the music stream market,half that of rivalSpotify, but Spotifi is not profit and struggl to justifi a $8 billion valuation, which at One Infinit Loop is consid seat cushion money.Apple' push into TV stream will be through a new app called, simply,TV, which aim to solv one of the most vex problem for a stream user - decid what to watch next. The Appl TV stream servic itself ha yet to launch, butrumor about it abound. Appl want to get the same 30% revenu cut on TV stream it get on apps, produc a servic that will cost $20-30 per month.Th most persist rumor about Apple' intent regard stream involveHBO Now, a Time Warner servic that cost $15 per month, and which wa Appl exclus for a few month in 2015. Appl ha the financi wherewith to buy HBO as part of Time Warner' merger with AT&T, or to buy a broadcast compani like CB for cash. Appl TV hardwar isus by an estim 11.9%of TV stream customers.Thank to it exist servic businesses, global reach and over $200 billion in cash, Appl ha the freedom to be patient and negoti with right holder befor launch a TV stream service. But it is far more concern with maintain it high margin than with drive traffic, which hurt it in competit with servic whose price start at virtual free, like Google' YouTub and Amazon Prime.It is hard for me to see how Appl can win in stream when it' unwil to bend on margin to win market share, and will to dither aimlessli with exist TV right holder while rival are creat their own show and even new type of experiences.7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendBut that' just my opinion. I bought Appl share befor it 7:1 split in 2014, sold about half, but retain them in my retir account. It' go to be a nice retirement.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: AT&T (T)Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrI got my first glimps of the futur sever year ago, when right to English Premier Leagu game came up for bids.Th winner weren't the tradit networks, public or private. They wereSki TV, a direct broadcast satellit company, andBritish Telecom, the state phone company.Thi wa year befor AT&T said it would buy Time Warnerfor a report $85.4 billion. It wa even year befor AT&T agre to spend$48.5 billion forDirecTV, the direct broadcast satellit business.Th two deal will combin to transform AT&T from a phone compani into a stream player. It will be abl to bundl wireless, satellit and internet subscriptions, and let it custom stream show from DirecTV to their mobil deviceswithout cost.It new stream service, DirecTV Now, carri an introductori price of $35 per month for 60 channel and attractedov 200,000 custom dure the fourth quarterwhich help offset a loss of custom from it more tradit cabl service, U-Verse. It compet ina cord-cut nichealongsideSl TV, own by DirecTV rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), and Playstat Vue, own bySoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE)For the fourth quarter, AT&T report net incom of $2.44 billion, 39 cent per share, on revenu of $41.84 billion. While thi didn't clear the company' 49-cent-per-shar dividend payment dure the quarter, for the year the compani did earn $2.10 per share, beat the $1.93 annual dividend. It' the dividend, a 4.7% yield to today' stock buyer, that you'r buy when you buy AT&T stock. The share themselv are worth littl more than they were in 2007.I switch from Comcast to AT&T for my own TV and internet servic last year, combin it with my exist mobil phone subscription. I now pay the compani about $400 per month for variou services. That' a lot of cash flow. I should probabl buy the stock.AT&T is the most tradit of the new stream players. It earn a place in thi galleri for it sheer size, with annual revenu of $164 billion, and it control of key internet infrastructur in the core of the network and at the edge.AT&T ha move into stream for defens reasons. Internet advoc have critic it for DirecTV Now, which give it own custom free bit that other are charg for, ignor the concept of network neutrality, but the Donald Trump Administr isgiv it a free pass on that.When the acquisit of Time Warner is final - and that look like a better bet with Trump in charg - AT&T will own a big hunk of the tradit cabl universe, includ HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network.Tim Warner agre to be bought, in part, becaus it need cash to compet for program against deep-pocket rival like Netflix, Amazon, Googl and possibl Apple. AT&T bought Time Warner becaus the vertic integr - own the program as well as the network so you write right check to yourself - should allow it to maintain that dividend.Comcast made the marriag of network infrastructur and content work with NBC Universal, mainli by keep it hand off it creativ people. It is still unclear to me whether AT&T will be will to do the same, or whether it will focu on milk a die industri for profits, which ha been it way of do busi sinc I began cover them over three decad ago.That' the onli thing keep me from buy the shares. That and the lack of capit gains.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Facebook (FB)Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is the newest and, base on revenue, the second-smallest of the new stream players, behind onli Netflix.Dur the Decemb quarter Facebookearn $1.41 per shareon $8.81 billion in revenue. Thi make it four time bigger than Netflix by revenue. With a market cap of about $390 billion, it isth sixth most valuabl compani in the country, less than five year after first go public.Facebook got into stream withFacebook Live, a sort of YouTub for streaming, which ha alreadi made news with Hous Democrat stream a sit-in when Republican turn off their camera and with Donald Trump announc a Suprem Court pick on the service.Facebook Live is alreadi get Facebook into troubl with right holders, like the TV network which saw sale of a recent pay-per-view fight in Australia impact when one subscribersimpli held hi phone up to hi TV and stream it. There is even a name for thi kind of thing -""stream ripping.""Facebook is reportedlywork on an app for streaming, which would put it into more direct competit with Appl TV and Google' YouTube. Thi would be a softwar solut that let it piggyback on others' hardware, like Chromecast, Amazon' Fire Stick and Appl TV. In addit to support it streaming, the app would also support 10-minut TV show with commerci insert into them,lik broadcast TV in the 1940s.What make Facebook power in stream is the sheer number of peopl use the servic - nearli 2 billion - and the amount of time they spend with it. The averag global user spend 20 minut per day on the service, andth averag American spend twice that amount of time.Analyst are divid on analogiesfor Facebook' strategi here. Is it Netflix? Is it YouTube?In fact, neither analog is correct. Facebook mainli want to integr video into it exist offering. It is back away frompay publish for streams, and may be back away in the near term as peopl use it unmoder do-it-yourself stream to show themselvescommit violent crimesandeven commit suicide.Al thi remind me of someth I wrote 20 year ago, about telephony. Telephoni is simpli an internet service. Today, video is the same, an internet service. The differ is that video is far more intim than a phone call, easier to make money from and subject to discuss of rights, or right and wrong.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenIntegr video, even stream video, as just one part of a broader comput experi is the road not be taken by anyon but Facebook.Stock to Buy for the Futur of TV: Alibaba (BABA)Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) got into stream in 2015 by buyingYouku Tudou, a Chines version of YouTube,for $4 billion-plus.Alibaba wa late to thi business, but is work hard to make up for lost time. It launch a paid stream servic calledTmal Box Officein September, 2015. It ha a TV oper systemcal YunOS, which is get it stream servic into home throughout East and South Asia.In 2016, Alibaba launchedpartnership with a host of global producers, the most import be with Steven Spielberg'sAmblin Entertainment, which is aim to bring Chines stori to American audienc and vice versa. Alibaba also took a stakein China'sHeH Picturesand sign a deal withHarri Potterproduc David Heyman to produc a seri of movi aroundWarriors,a children' book seri about war cats. Alreadi in 2017 Alibaba ha sign to becomea major sponsor of the Olymp Games, respons for stream event and back-end cloud computing.Thank to deal like this, Alibaba' digit media revenu grew 270% year-over-year, init most recent quarterli report.Th segment produc $585 million in revenue.Despit all this, Alibaba is still a rel minnow in the stream TV stock waters. It stream revenu is just one-quart that of Netflix. What make it powerful, and a threat to the giants, is it strength throughout Asia, not just in China; it willing to buy it way into busi like movi production; and it highli profit growth trajectory, which give it a cash hoard worth $15 billion, which it is far more aggress about invest than Apple.Becaus Alibaba enabl commerce, rather than buy inventori as Amazon does, it bring over 25% of it revenu to the net incom line, with oper cash flow that ha grown four-fold in the last four years. It ha enorm advantag in China, the world' second-largest and one of it fastest-grow markets. Thi ha given it a springboard into other market like India, Indonesia and Thailand, where it is also grow a rang of services.It is just a matter of time befor Alibaba becom a major factor in the U.S. market, through it ownership of content and cloud oper if noth else. Ani innov a U.S. compani can come up with, moreover, can be jump on by Alibaba in a flash, grown in China as a captiv market, and then sprung on the world quickly.It may be the most import stori of the next four years, but it won't be televised. It will definit be streamed. I'm a buyer.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, avail at the Amazon Kindl store.

Amazon's U.S. Online Sales Growth Last Year Was More Than Everyone Else's Combined;2/10/2017;"It' no secret thatAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a domin forc in onlin retail. But it' still astound just how domin it' been in recent years. New data fromSlic Intelligenceshow Amazon took 53% of all the sale growth of onlin retail in the US last year.Amazon' North American sale increas 25.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, the U.S. Censu Bureau ha been track e-commerc sale growth around 15.5% through the first three quarter of the year.Put anoth way, despit it size, Amazon continu to take share of the grow e-commerc market, and competitor such asWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) are struggl to keep up.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Amazon.com.$53 billion in retail sale up for grabsWhil the U.S. Censu Bureau hasn't releas it estim for the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapol out the steadi growth rate of the first three quarter result in $53 billion in onlin sale for 2016. In addition, the major of retail growth in the Unit State come from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total growth came from onlin sales.Slice' number may be a bit off, consid Amazon saw an increas of ""just"" $16 billion in sale across all of North America. Still, the compani is undoubtedli take market share as it sale growth outpac the overal industry.With e-commerc account for such a signific share of retail growth in the Unit States, Amazon' biggest competitors, like Wal-Mart, are realli feel the hurt. While Amazon' North American sale increas 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart' overal U.S. sale increas just 3.3% through the first three quarter of the year.Wal-Mart' e-commerc sale fare a bit better, increas 7%, 11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. The third quarter wa boost by the acquisit of Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart' organ e-commerc sale still appear to lag the industry.How is Amazon domin retail?Even if you'r skeptic of Slice' claim that Amazon took 53% of onlin sale growth last year, it' clear that Amazon account for a huge share of the retail growth in the Unit States. Not just e-commerc growth, but overal retail sales.Slic had a few thought to share on whi Amazon ha been abl to stay ahead of the competition:Fast shipping.Amazon' averag ship time fell about 1.5 day over the past two years, and it remain more than two day faster than the averag competitor, accord to Slice' data. Wal-Mart recent start offeringfre two-day shippingon about 2 million select items, but it select pale in comparison with the 50 million Prime-elig item on Amazon.Subscriptions.Amazon' subscribe-and-sav featur allow custom to automat reorder a product, receiv free shipping, and get a discount to boot. That' quit an incent to becom a repeat customer.Eas of ordering.Product such as Amazon' Echo smart speaker or it Dash button make order product from Amazon easier than put on pant -- the veri pant I order from Amazon.Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fuel Amazon' continu domin of retail in the Unit State is it Prime program. Prime make custom extrem loyal. It' what fuel 55% of onlin shopper to check Amazon.com first (and mayb last). And it caus shopper to spend more on Amazon than their non-Prim counterparts.Last year, Amazon ad ""ten of millions"" of new Prime members, accord to it fourth-quart earn release. Unlik the previou two years, when Amazon experienc around 50% annual growth in membership, the compani didn't provid a growth rate.That may be becaus Prime membership is near satur in market such as the Unit States. Estim show more than half of U.S. household are alreadi Prime members. Still, with a grow major of household subscrib to Prime (even if that growth is slowing) and go to Amazon as their first onlin shop destination, it look as if Amazon will continu to take share of the U.S. retail market for the forese future.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

The 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stocks Today;2/10/2017;"The classic ""Dog of the Dow"" strategi advis buy the 10 highest-yield Dow Jone Industri Averag stocks, then hold onto them for a year. The idea is that higher yield are a signal of a beaten-up share price - and that becaus we'r buy a stabl blue-chip with a stabl custom base, investor will eventu bid the stock back up when the busi cycl turn up again.But we can further improv on thi effect yet somewhat ""dumb"" strategi with a bit of second-level analysis. After all, some of these compani have busi model that are actual age in dog years! And they should be avoided.Today we'r go to discuss four high pay Dow components. Two are compel buys, while two should be sold immedi (or even shorted).makeArticleAd();WINNER: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield:3.6%Exxon Mobil (XOM)i emerg from what easili ha been one of the most tri point in the company' history, the root of which stretch all the way back to 1870.From about mid-2014 through the start of 2016,oil pricesplung from near $110 down to below $30 - a collaps that caus energi stock across the sector to careen into the ground, and forc numer compani to shut their doors.Even Exxon Mobil - America' biggest energi compani by market capitalization, and one of the world' largest and most diversifi oil and ga oper - wasn't immune. Share dip from around $105 to around $72 or so - a 30%-plu dip in just more than a year' time, which is virtual unheard of in blue chip as well-establish as XOM. Pundit thought that Exxon' streak of dividend increases, which span more than three decades, wa in jeopardy.However, former CEO Rex Tillerson himself manag the compani in such a way that he knew it oper could surviv with oil price as low as $40 per barrel. April 2016 came around, and XOM maintain it statu as a Dividend Aristocrat with a small but symbol payout hike. Meanwhile, XOM share have claw back at least some of their losses.Speak of Tillerson ...The former Exxon CEO is a ""former"" chief becaus he' now America' Secretari of State. That' no doubt a boon to XOM, especi consid the Trump administration' seemingli favor and cooper view with Russia - where Exxon ha huge energi interest and projects, and where Tillerson himself ha deep ties.Moreover, Presid Donald Trump and a GOP-control Congress are prove extrem friendli to the energi sector as a whole right now, most recent with a Senat vote to knock down a rule govern transpar on energi firms' payment to foreign governments.Exxon wa alreadi set up well to benefit from an eventu return to high oil prices, and now it' seemingli in the driver' seat. While investor wait for those gain to take hold, they can enjoy 3.6% in dividend from thi relentless oil titan.Exxon (XOM): Thi Long-Tim Winner Is in Recoveri ModeLOSER: Walmart (WMT)Dividend Yield:3%Walmart (WMT)i one of the perfect exampl of how a big, solid blue-chip can still be a big, solid dud.Walmart is the largest retail in the world, and in fact Earth' biggest compani by revenue, boast more than 11,000 store across 28 countries. BeforeAmazon.com (AMZN)cam around, Walmart wa consid one of the biggest disruptor to tradit brick-and-mortar retail. It bargain-bas price and enorm product offer upend countless mom n' pop shops, but also put the hurt to larger specialti retail such asBest Buy (BBY)andH.H.Gregg (HGG).But Amazondidcom along, and that - along with Walmart' ubiqu and lack of option for expans - are at the veri least keep Walmart from be the invest powerhous it onc was.Whil WMT doe produc world-class revenues, top-lin growth ha been thin for years, and in 2016, Walmart' sale actual drop year-over-year:Walmart ha been spend for year tri to bring it onlin offer up to par to battl Amazon' unstopp e-commerc machin - yet it just keep fall farther behind. Dividend growth is lag too - last year manag up it payout by a meager 2%. WMT ha lag the total return of the S&P 500 for the last 15 year - it' time to cut thi dead weight loose.WINNER: Boe (BA)Dividend Yield:3.5%Bo (BA)just boost it dividend by 30% to $1.42 per share - more than doubl it quarterli payout from 2013! And Boeing' generos to sharehold didn't stop there. The compani also upgrad it old stock repurchas program by implement a new $14 billion buyback plan.Futur busi prospect are look good.

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It' no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) wa the best perform stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gain more than 370%. But while the company' graphic processor unit (GPU) chip are be use in everyth from game PC to autonom car to virtual realiti to data centers, the reinvigor of Nvidia is built by one thing: artifici intelligence.AI is increasingli be use in everyth and everywhere, most notabl data center for machin learning, where Nvidia' GPU have a tremend lead over the competition, includ anyth from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenu wa up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impress fiscal third-quart 2017 result that help send the stock soar more than 30% in Novemb 2016.makeArticleAd();Th technolog is touch everyth and anyone, be it on your smartphon or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or use software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the futur of software.If you read Nvidia' confer call transcript and itsearn press release, AI is mention everywher and with good reason: deep learn is onli made possibl by the advanc in AI be made by univers research and big compani such as Googl (GOOG), Appl (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In react to the blow-out earn results, Jefferi analyst Mark Lipaci call Nvidia essenti the onli publicli trade compani sole focus on AI. ""[Nvidia] post it 7th consecut beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% like mark 2nd deriv peak, the 200% growth in it Datacent busi and improv GM reinforc our thesi that NVDA is emerg as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most excit growth driver in tech,"" Lipaci wrote, while rais hi price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforement areas, perhap the one that is most tangibl to show consum the AI revolut is autonom driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneer autonom drive in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla ha chosen to use Nvidia' chipset to not onli help it with it infotain unit, but more importantly, the softwar that help withautonomy, use the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI comput platform.Societi is a littl bit away from true autonomi in a car (Level 5), in which a human doe not need to do anything, but Tesla is work on get toward Level 4/5 faster than anyon else, thank to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia ha sever other automot partnerships, includ recent announc one with Bosch andAudi.Al of thi highlight that self-driv car is not just a scienc fiction fantasy, it' real and it' coming. And it' be power by AI. The societ impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net posit or a net negative, but there is no stop it.AI is continu to becom more preval in everyth we do, but we are nowher near gener AI, in which comput can make decis just as a human can. What we'r experienc right now is soft (weak) AI, in which human tell a comput to do a task and it doe it better than ani human can. But thank to deep/machin learning, we'r get closer to gener AI, even if it' still decad away. That mean the AI revolut is onli just get start and it ha year and year on which to run.Al thank to Nvidia."

The higher share ofAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) goes, the riskier it get for investors. AMD stock still ha $1.44 billion in debt against $1.26 billion in cash and equivalents. In earli March, the chip supplier is about to make it biggest launch it hi histori with Ryzen, and that' bound to make a lot of noise.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrFor the time being, detail of AMD' Ryzen are limited. Although the compani recent demo the chip in a gameplay demonstration, it gave no detail on the chip' pricing.Without know what Ryzen offer at a price-to-perform ratio compar toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), the harder it is to predict Ryzen' sale when it launches.AMD' (Leaked) Ryzen RoadmapIf theleak rumorsar true, AMD will launch three class of PC chips: high-range, medium-rang and entry-level. Denot R7 (8 core, 16 threads), R5 (4-6 core, 8-12 threads) and R3 (4 core, 4 threads), respectively, the CPU will differ by core, thread and clock speed. The mid- and high-rang chip will compet with Intel' mainstream processors, the i5 and i7.Click to EnlargeRyzen' processor speed doe not aim to out-clock that of Intel chips. Rather, AMD' strategi primarili target the enthusiast PC game community. Ryzen will pair with the next-gener GPU (graphic process unit) Vega chips.Aft Ryzen' launch in March, AMD will releas Vega sometim in the second quarter. Mention of Ryzen pick up again on Feb 9.7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendRyzen' Processor SizeAlthough Advanc Micro Devic ismanufacturingZen on 14nm, it an area of 44 squar millimet impli that the chip will at least match or beat Intel' chips. Befor Lisa Su' leadership, AMD did not talk about manufactur at 14nm.Prior to Ryzen, Advanc Micro Devic embrac x86 chip at 28nm. The engin achiev will lead to lower manufactur cost and higher profit margin for AMD stock. On it confer call, the compani reveal that it aim to achiev gross margin of around 33% in the first quarter. In the quarter befor that, it gross margin hover in the 31%-rang due to the product mix. With Ryzen on the list, expect that profit number to improv quarter after quarter.Manufactur of the processor will onli get better andgo all the way down to 7nm:""They are not just buy a point product and we have a multi-gener roadmap that we are work on, includ sort of the Zen 2 and the Zen 3 follow on. From our standpoint process technology, we ramp 16nm and 14nm realli well last year and into thi year. We are actual in the process of develop now in 7nm and we think the 7nm foundri roadmap that are avail are veri competit and will ensur that we have a strong multi-gener roadmap.""AMD stock' valuat may scare investor ahead of the Ryzen launch.

3 Big Bets Cisco Systems, Inc. Is Making -- Will They Be Enough?;2/10/2017;"Cisco System Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) ha been best known in the past for it enterpris network hardware, but the compani continu to build out and grow it other segment with some interest recent innov and acquisitions. Here are some of the area of growth Cisco is bet on, the pressur it' get from new competitor likeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , and whi the stock look like a fine hold as the compani transit for the future.1: Build smart, connect citiesIn a recent blog post, Cisco manag said that cloud comput is ""the fourth industri revolution."" The compani estim that by 2020, over 90% of total data center traffic will be via cloud networks. While there are mani compani work to provid servic for individuals' and companies' cloud needs, Cisco is gear up to offer it servic to citi around the world.Cisco launch the ""Smart+Connect Citi Platform"" at the Smart Citi Expo World Congress 2016 in Barcelona in November, and the compani say thi servic is ""a central layer for address the infrastructur need to connect cameras, water meters, traffic meters, and so on in a reliable, secure, robust and seamless manner."" Thi initi wa recent implement in Jaipur, India, which join Hamburg, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Kansa City, Missouri; and Adelaide, Australia as test smart cities. The video below show the CIO of Adelaid explain the import Cisco ha play in hi city.makeArticleAd();2: Becom an all-encompass IoT platform""Internet of Things"" ha becom a buzzword in 2016, but realli it just describ the grow trend of consum or otherwis low-tech item that are be connect to the internet and to each other, usual through a wireless cloud network. In fact, the smart citi initi is mostli about IoT on citi level. Estim on just how big thi market could be vari widely, but most analyst predict it could continu grow by ten ofbillionsof devic in the next few years.Cisco is increasingli make itself the bedrock for variou part of thi ecosystem, includ the actual hardwar that make these consum product connect possible, the connect through cloud networks, and the secur to make sure the IoT connect isn't easili compromised. Cisco acquir a cloud-bas IoT compani call Jasper Technolog last March for $1.4 billion, which, among other things, enabl more data-track and IoT management. Thi acquisit and other like it, along with Cisco' own innov in thi space, have help the compani to launch variou new product and bundl into thi space recently.Similar to Cisco' smart+connect citi push, the compani believ it ha the breadth of expertis and support to be the IoT platform for enterpris and government accounts. Rememb that Cisco alreadi ha a larg footprint in these spaces, so it might be easier for them to win over these big client as they seek an IoT solution.Imag source: Cisco Systems.3: CybersecurityWhil the first two area abov are incred excit in term of what they could mean for the futur of the digit world, they also open up the world to mani more risk in the form of cyber-threats. A recent intensifi focu on hack threat and the need to build secur solut throughout cloud networks, IoT platforms, and all other connect technolog creat an opportun Cisco is take advantag of.In February, the compani launch Cisco Firepower, a new firewal series, and the compani say it advanc secur system have been proven to help custom ""dramat reduc time to detect of attacks."" Throughout the year, the compani also launch new tool such as Cisco Umbrella and Umbrella Roaming, which are increas defens on router and VPN devic to block suspici activity. In September, Cisco acquir CloudLock, a compani that help provid integr secur solut for cloud-bas networks.Cisco' secur revenu in it fiscal Q1 end Oct. 29 rose 11% from the year-earli quarter to about $540 million. Even though that make up less than 5% of Cisco' total revenue, manag believ that have the focu and expertis in thi area will help them win over more busi within it other segment as consum and busi start to consid the need for the most secur network possibl a top priority.Can Cisco fend off competition?Cisco' tradit markets, which still make up the bulk of sales, have declin in recent quarters. Switching, which still make up nearli a third of total sales, slump 7% in the most recent quarter year over year. Overall, even with the growth above, total sale in the quarter gain a paltri 1%. Additionally, manag gave less-than-excit guidanc for earli fiscal 2017.More concern is that in the company' new growth areas, it face some seriou competition. The biggest of them is Amazon Web Servic (AWS), which offer both public and privat cloud host solutions, as well as IoT solutions, usual for a lower cost than tradit options. The servic ha success stori from some big name likeNetflixandComcast, just to name a few, which ha help rais it prestige. In term of security, Amazon provid cloud servic to U.S. intellig agencies, so clearly, secur is import to them as well. AW is grow quickli -- up nearli 50% year over year in the most recent quarter to over $3.5 billion.Th earli success of the segment abov are encouraging. Additionally, Cisco ha been abl to gain a lot of expertis and valu from acquir smaller tech compani in these high-growth segments, and Cisco is in a great posit to continu that strategi with around $70 billion in cash that it' like to start deploy more heavili in the quarter and year to come. While Cisco will certainli face increas growth pressur ahead, especi with AW disrupt thi space, it look to be make some smart move to transit it focus. Finally, Cisco is trade at just 15 time earnings, just 2.5 time book valu (compar with Amazon' P/B at 21.7 times), and ha a 3.3% dividend yield that continu to grow. It look like there' plenti of reason to hold Cisco to see how these market transform in the year ahead -- and how thi behemoth tech compani will play a part in them.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIn late December, I made apredictionthatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock would hit $80 in 2017.

The remain 285 million share he agre to donat back in June 2006 will be dole out at a rate of 5% per year until all 500 million share are in the hand of the foundat sometim around 2036.So, the choic come down to whether it make sens to sell the share of Microsoft for cash to fund the foundation' work and continu to hold the Berkshir Hathaway share as an invest or the other way around.Th Gate have chosen the former rather than the latter.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuabl Than You ThinkOn the surface, that would seem to be a mistak given MSFT stock ha outperform Berkshir Hathaway Class B stock by 269 basi point on annual basi over the last five year through Feb. 6.So, with that in mind, doe it make sens for Bill Gate to sell hi MSFT stock?I don't think he should as some of it best growth lie in the immedi future. But, I also don't think the trust should sell Berkshir Hathaway stock becaus it provid such good diversif and protect of capital.Both of these stock are worth own for the long haul.If it were up to me, I'd probabl look at cash in some of the trust' other hold first, but thank for all those around the world deserv of the good educ and healthcar the foundat look to fund, it' not up to me.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendTh postShould Bill Gate Sell Hi Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock?appear first onInvestorPlace."

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earn (Shutterstock photo)It appear the onli thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climb higher are investors’ expectations. Thank to the company’ advanc in cutting-edg technolog such as deep learn and artifici intellig (AI), NVDA share have soar some 340% over the past year, crush everi import index.A such, the California-bas semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-lin number that cruis by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answer the call. But the share appear muted, fall as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantag point, thi decline, which I consid inconsequential, is victori for Nvidia and it investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’ go though the numbers.In the three month that end December, Nvidia report net a incom of $655 million, or 99 cent per share. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, earn came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensu estim by a whop 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenu also beat, come in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street wa look for revenu of $2.11 billion.Th strong bottom-lin beat wa driven by record quarterli GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the compani said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When look back at fiscal 2016, the compani broke sever of it own records, includ full-year revenu of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""W had a great finish to a record year, with continu strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU comput platform is enjoy rapid adopt in artifici intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonom vehicles. Huang also ad that Nvidia’ deep learn GPU (graphic process units) ha made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in earli cancer detection, weather predict and is help to tackl challeng such as self-driv cars.Al told, it is these breakthrough area that continu to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believ until now. And while the tech battl ha alway been between Appl (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guy are not alon anymore.In term of the 3% declin on these solid numbers? Nvidia is be shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to declin 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still impli the momentum stori is still in place. And Nvidia’ Q1 outlook for revenu to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estim of $1.88 billion, suggest it see no sign of slow down."

Why I’m Raising My Price Target On Microsoft Corporation Stock (MSFT);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you thinkMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) share are expens now, they are about to get even more so.makeArticleAd();Back in December,I issueda 12-month piec target of $72 per share. But follow the company' breathtak fiscal second-quart earn results, I am now confid is too cheap.A such I'm rais my price target by $8 per share to $80 per share.Whi the price increase? For starters, Microsoft stock is current price at a forward P/E of just 21 base on fiscal 2017 estim of $2.97 per share. And while that P/E is two point abov the averag stock in the S&P 500 index, Microsoft' recent move suggest it deserv a much higher multiple.With growth opportun emerg in the realm of the cloud, Internet-of-Things, smart home and a host of other area thank to it recent acquisitions, Microsoft stock still look like a bargain. I'll get back to thi in a moment. But let' first assess it recent earnings.Th main question head into 2017 wa to what extent Microsoft could sustain the strong cloud momentum it use in 2016 to surpassAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN).Microsoft answer that question with authority. In three month that end December, the compani earn $5.2 billion, or 66 cent per share, rise from $5.02 billion a year earlier. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, earn came to 84 cent per share, which beat the consensu estim of 79 cent per share. Second-quart revenu came in at $24.1 billion, while adjust revenu wa $26.1 billion, also top Wall Street estimates.Th company' aggress move toward the cloud wa the main driver of the strong top- and bottom-lin beat. Not onli doe thi lessen Microsoft' relianc on declin PC sales, but cloud busi also gener higher margins. Revenu from the Offic 365 busi grew almost 50% year-over-year, while gross margin in it commerci cloud business, which includ Azur and Offic 365 product sold to businesses, reach 48% dure the quarter - up two percentag point year-over-year.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth Potential""Our custom are see greater valu and opportun as we partner with them through their digit transformation,"" said CEO Satya Nadella in a statement. ""Acceler advanc in AI across our platform and servic will provid further opportun to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.""Azur revenu surg 93% year-over-year (up 95% in constant currency) dure the quarter. Though Microsoft provid no specif dollar amount to help break down the cloud revenue, Bernstein analyst Mark Mordler estim Azur now gener some 20% of commerci cloud revenue, which Microsoft said wa gener an ""annual run rate"" just north of $14 billion, accord to Barron's. Thi mean Azur now gener quarterli revenu at around $3 billion.Between now and 2020, worldwid spend on public cloud servic is expect to soar to more than $195 billion. Thi is doubl the revenu the industri is expect to gener by the end of 2016, accord to a research firm IDC.""Cloud softwar will significantli outpac tradit softwar product deliveri over the next five years, grow nearli three time faster than the softwar market as a whole and becom the signific growth driver to all function softwar markets,"" said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, Saa and Busi Models. ""Bi 2020, about half of all new busi softwar purchas will be of service-en software, and cloud softwar will constitut more than a quarter of all softwar sold.""IDC is not alon in thi prediction. Pacif Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecast public cloud spending, current around $58 billion annually, will tripl to $205 billion in the next three years. Dure that span, Bracelin see spend on Saa servic to surg 20% annually, reach $129 billion by 2020.A Microsoft' cloud busi take up greater portion of it total revenue, Microsoft stand to secur larger piec of the cloud pie. And Microsoft, which dure the second quarter complet it blockbust $26.2 billion acquisit of LinkedIn, now ha even more way to attract busi to Azure. To that end, Microsoft stock should command a higher P/E of 4 to 6 point abov it current valuation.When appli a P/E of just 25 to fiscal 2018 estim of $3.26 per share, thi put the stock' fair valu at around $80. That valuat is still more than half that of Amazon, which reli on it AW cloud platform for the bulk of it profits. And with almost $121 billion in cash on it balanc sheet make more deal for growth in key areas, Microsoft, which also pay a 2.45% annual dividend yield, is a stock to own and forget about.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuabl Than You ThinkRisk To Consider:Much of my optim is base on the assumpt that Microsoft can continu to increas cloud market share and success integr LinkedIn.Act To Take:Microsoft should be kept on the watchlist of investor who are look for a compani with upsid potenti that pay a reliabl dividend.Editor' Note:Al Wall Street firm closely-guard theirblack box trade systemsto gain an edg over their competition.

Reinventing Retail: What if GoPro, Garmin, and Fitbit Rethought Everything?;2/9/2017;"One of the realiti of busi today is that retail in 2017 littl resembl retail of a decad ago. Product compani use to succeed or fail base on their distribut power and the shelf space retail gave them, and retail succeed or fail by have the right product at the best price for consumers. Scale in retail matter and that' how retail becam power broker in the product world.Retail today ha been complet flip on it head. A great product from a small busi can be a hit becaus it custom share their experi online. Go viral can be more import than be in the right retail in 2017. Today, anyon can open a store onlin or onAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Etsy,eBay, or ani number of other platforms.Th product develop landscap that use to reli on larg compani to succeed ha been flatten in a way that allow someon in a garag to creat a great product and get it out to the world. All of thi seem logic today, but so mani compani are still built as if the old retail model still exists. Product compani likeGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) ,Fitbit(NYSE: FIT) , andGarmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) are a great exampl of thi -- and if they'r go to succeed, they may have to rethink their busi model to incorpor the retail realiti of 2017.makeArticleAd();Dron are grow in popularity, but are they realli a retail impuls purchas in 2017? Imag source: GoPro.Th old retail model is ancient historyTh old retail model for a product compani essenti had three to four layers, depend on the channel. There wa manufacturing, the product compani would then have inventori on hand to fill orders, there may be a distributor who sell multipl product lines, and then there' the retail themselves. Manufactur ha to line up with end user demand, but in between is two to three layer of channel inventori that' incred complex to get exactli right, particularli if you'r a holiday-bas business.Thi model creat two challeng for compani like GoPro, Fitbit, and Garmin. First is that they have to get their product inventori build right so they don't miss the critic holiday season, but can't build too much or there' excess inventory. The second problem is that retail have to make money, so they'r cut into margin compar to if product were directli sold to customers. Whi not cut out the middleman?Th inventori problemI don't think I can overst how much of a problem inventori is for product compani or how quickli it can eras years' worth of profits. Compani have to tri to guess what demand will be month in advance, build product to ship to stores, and then if demand isn't as strong as they predicted, they usual have to take product back from retailers.Imag source: Garmin.In the fourth quarter of 2016, Fitbit say it will take a one-tim writedown of $68 million for ""tool equip and compon inventory,"" increas return reserv by $41 million becaus of ""greater channel inventory,"" and take anoth $37 million charg for ""increas rebat and channel price promotions"". That' $146 million in charg dure a singl quarter that wa driven by too much inventori in the retail channel. That quickli eras most of the $176 million in net incom from 2015, which wa a record for the company.Someth similar happen at GoPro in 2015. Fourth-quart 2015 result includ $21 million in lost revenu from ""price protect relat charges"" and $57 million in cost associ with ""excess purchas order commitments, excess inventori and obsolet tooling."" The $78 million in charg didn't quit offset 2014' full-year net incom of $128 million, but it took a big chunk out of past success.Build the right amount of inventori is tough for compani like this, especi when they'r sell into a channel with multipl layer of distribut inventory. Mayb it would be better to do a 100% direct busi model, especi when you consid the valu retail are take out of potenti profits.Direct sale are the product cash cowRetail can bring product to million of potenti customers, but they need to make money to do so. And that make retail sale far less profit for product compani than go direct to consumers. Here' an exampl of how the trade-off looks.Let' assum a retail ha a gross margin of 30%. So, GoPro would onli make $279 on a Hero 5 Black that retail for $399. And that' befor ani promot or volum discount a retail may be given that are then pass on to custom (think Black Friday deal on GoPro camera thi year).If we assum that it cost $200 to make a Hero 5 Black (base on margin for the company), then GoPro make about $79 per product sold at retail. But if GoPro sold the exact same camera directli to a custom on it websit it would get the entir $399 and have a $199 margin. On the bottom line, a direct sale is worth 2.5 time that of each retail camera sale.GoPro sold 2.28 million GoPro unit last quarter and a littl over half went through a distribut channel. But if GoPro would have sold everi camera directli to customers, it could have sold at least 25% fewer unit and actual made more money. And thi is befor we even consid the sale staff and inventori that could be elimin if a compani onli sold directli to customers.Thi is a hypothet example, but it should be direct accur for product companies. Sell in retail isn't the highest-margin busi ani of these compani have, and it may not be worth the effort at all when you consid the charg a compani ha to take if they get their inventori buildout wrong.Less risk, more profitWhen I look at compani like GoPro, Fitbit, and Garmin, I see a busi that could surviv veri easili without ani retail presenc at all. A $400 action camera or $500 triathlon watch isn't exactli an impuls purchase, so custom will find your product if they'r the veri best. And if these compani went with a more direct model, they may gener significantli higher profit even if sale fall. On top of that, a simpler distribut model mean they could take less inventori risk.Chang busi model may be hard, but the retail busi isn't what it onc was, and if it' not a huge benefit to a business, then whi pursu it at all? As tradit retail slowli dies, I think it' time for product compani to look for better strateg alternatives. GoPro, Fitbit, and Garmin may be better off build on top of their brand with a direct model rather than tri to reach everyon in retail.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever;2/9/2017;"The ""simple"" method of buy and hold a stock realli isn't all that simple. Some compani might post stabl growth for years, but suddenli be crush by technolog shift or new competitors.Therefore, stock that you can buy and hold ""forever"" should have well-diversifi businesses, wide competit moats, and solid plan for futur growth. Let' take a look at three compani that clearli fit those criteria --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Disney(NYSE: DIS) , andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) .AmazonAmazon is one of my top ""forever"" hold for three reasons. First, it own the most visit e-commerc websit in the world. Second, it ""prisoner-taking"" Prime ecosystem continu expand with new featur and perk that brick-and-mortar rival are struggl to match. Last June, research firm CIRP estim that Amazon' Prime member base in the U.S. had grown 43% annual to 63 million, and that Prime shopper spend an averag of $1,200 per year -- compar to $500 for non-members.makeArticleAd();Amazon' Prime Air. Imag source: Amazon.Lastly, AW (Amazon Web Services) is the biggest cloud platform in the world, and it higher oper margin (26% last quarter) support the company' other lower margin and loss-lead efforts. AW ha an annual run rate of $14 billion, and it revenu and oper profit respect rose 47% and 60% annual last quarter.Th combin of the grow Prime ecosystem, connect hardwar devic like the Kindle, Fire TV, and Echo speakers, and the AW backbon make Amazon the 800-pound gorilla in both retail and cloud comput -- and I believ that it can continu domin both market (and other adjac ones) for decad to come.DisneyIf you believ that Disney' theme park and movi franchis will still be make money hand over fist decad from now, then the Hous of Mous is the ideal stock to hold forever. In theme park and resorts, Disney' footprint continu to grow with it new Shanghai Disney Resort, new extens (like Star War Land) for it exist parks, and a grow fleet of cruis ships. In movies, Disney continu gener billion of dollar in box offic revenu per year with it care craft Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar franchis -- which are all built to last for decades.Disney' onli soft spot is it media business, which ha been hurt by consum ""cut the cord"" in favor of streaming-onli platforms. A key concern is that ESPN, the crown jewel of the business, ha been lose subscribers, disprov the notion that live sport were insul from cord cutters. However, Disney hasbeen expandingit core cabl brands, like ESPN, away from tradit pay TV platform and toward websites, apps, and stand-alon stream platforms.Ov time, I believ that the media business' depend on pay TV platform will decline, and that the weight of it theme park and film busi will increase. That gradual evolut should make Disney a safe stock to own for gener to come.FacebookFacebook finish last quarter with 1.86 billion monthli activ user -- about a quarter of the entir world population. That' a moat that' nearli imposs for ani competitor to cross, and make the compani the 800-pound gorilla of social network and a formid rival toAlphabet' Googl in the internet advertis space.In addit to it flagship site, Facebook own Instagram, which hit 600 million activ user last December, and WhatsApp, which hit 1.2 billion activ user last month. It' also been turn Messenger, which ha over a billion users, into a gigant platform for reach businesses, make mobil payments, and play games.Th Oculu Rift. Imag source: Oculu VR.Lastly, Facebook own Oculu VR, the maker of the semin Rift headset. Facebook also launch it own VR platform with Oculu Home, a VR launcher for Rift and Gear VR headsets. User can alreadi chat and play game with each other in that VR environment, so it' like onli a matter of time befor user will visit each other' Facebook or Instagram profil in a VR environment. Facebook' growth will inevit slow down over the next few decades, but it will like keep gener billion of dollar in advertis revenu as it expand it ecosystem into adjac markets.Think in decades, not quarters...Mani analyst are current focus on Amazon, Disney, and Facebook' near-term challenges. They'r worri about Amazon' rise logist expens and the perceiv slowdown in AWS' top line growth. They think that Disney' stream effort might not offset it loss in pay TV subscribers, and they probabl think Facebook is run out of room to grow.But as a long-term investor, you should ask yourself if Amazon, Disney, and Facebook will continu grow over the next few decades. If so, then you should consid buy and hold these stock for sever decad instead of a few quarters.10 stock we like better than Walt DisneyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers;2/9/2017;"Share ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant post mix fourth quarter earn and soft guidanc for the first quarter. Revenu rose 22% annual to $43.7 billion, but that miss expect by $980 million. The compani wa hit hard by currenc headwinds, which reduc it top line by about $558 million. Amazon' close watch AW (Amazon Web Services) revenu rose 47% annual to $3.54 billion, but that also miss expect of $3.6 billion and repres a slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expect 14.1% to 22.7% year-over-year sale growth, which miss analyst forecast for 23.4% growth. But on a currenc neutral basis, which exclud an expect currenc impact of $730 million, Amazon expect it revenu to rise 17% to 25%.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Som neg report about Amazon focus on those headlin numbers, but they gloss over mani of the posit growth figures. Let' take a look at six incred number from that report that investor shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDur the fourth quarter, Amazon' net incom rose 55% annual to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat expect by $0.19. For the full year, it net incom surg over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incred growth wa mostli attribut to the rapid growth of AWS' high-margin business, which give Amazon much more freedom to expand it e-commerc ecosystem with low-margin hardwar like it Echo speakers, loss-lead servic like Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logist solut like new fulfil center and drones.2. AWS' oper margin of 26%AW finish last quarter with an oper margin of 26%, compar to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expans indic that AWS' massiv scale is offset tough price competit across the cloud platform market, which caus Amazon and it rival to reduc their price throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announc that AW had achiev an annual run rate of $14 billion, indic that it maintain a command lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azur in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claim that it ""commerci cloud"" had achiev an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of that total came from Saa platform like Offic 365 and Dynam CRM. Azur -- which compet directli against AW in the IaaS/Paa ""cloud platform"" market -- account for a much smaller percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclos how much revenu Azur generates, but combin earlier industri estim and it report growth rate over the past few quarter indic that it annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AW featuresAmazon alreadi serv massiv custom like NASA, the CDC, andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it' continu widen the platform' competit moat against rival platform like Azur with new features. Amazon ad over 1,000 new featur and servic to AW in fiscal 2016, compar to about 700 in 2015.It also open eleven new AW Avail Zone across five geograph region in 2016, bring AWS' total coverag to 42 Avail Zone across 16 region globally. That massiv data center expans will help AW reach more compani and developers, all while support the expans of it e-commerc and digit ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digit ecosystem expans is Prime Video, the company' stream answer to Netflix. Amazon ha made the platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscrib and a stand-alon subscript servic that cost slightli less than Netflix.Lik Netflix, Amazon is invest heavili in origin content, and popular show likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelp it becom the third largest video stream platform in the U.S. after YouTub and Netflix last year, accord to research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also follow Netflix' lead and invest heavili in local origin content in key market like Japan and India, which could help expand it Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skill for AlexaAmazon also taught it voic recognit platform Alexa 4,000 new skill sinc last October. It note that ""ten of thousand of developers"" are build new skill for the platform -- which power the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devic -- and that it wa work with ""a lot of major companies"" to integr their product with that ecosystem.Th expans of the Alexa ecosystem is important, becaus it can give Amazon control of users' connect home via Dash buttons, DRS-enabl appliances, and other connect devices. In addit to boost it e-commerc revenu with ""frictionless"" orders, that platform can process data through AW and widen it moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet' Google, which is tri to establish it own home-bas ecosystem around it Home smart speaker.Th key takeawayAmazon' fourth quarter report wa lumpy, but investor shouldn't overlook these posit numbers. Analyst still expect Amazon' revenu and earn to respect rise 22% and 53% next year -- so it overal growth won't peak anytim soon. Therefore, I believ that investor should take advantag of Amazon' temporari swoon and pick up a few more share for the long term.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It GAAP-adjust net incom rose 21% annual to $13.6 million, or $0.16 per share.Imag source: Grubhub.makeArticleAd();For investor who aren't familiar with GrubHub, the compani is the top onlin deliveri and takeout order marketplac in the country. It portfolio includ GrubHub, Seamless, LAbite, Restaur on the Run, DiningIn, and Deliv Dish. The compani work with over 50,000 restaur partner in over 1,100 U.S. citi and London.Despit it post-earn swoon, share of GrubHub remain up almost 90% over the past 12 months. To figur out where GrubHub is head thi year, let' discuss three reason to buy and three reason to sell thi hot stock.Thre reason to buy GrubhubGrubHub' activ diner (uniqu account which order within the past 12 months) rose 21% annual to 8.17 million last quarter. That repres an acceler from it 19% growth in the third quarter.GrubHub' daili averag grub (orders) also rose 21% annual to 274,800, compar to 26% growth in the third quarter. GrubHub now serv daili activ grub in 22 markets, compar to just seven at the time of it IPO in 2014. Those increas order boost it gross food sale by 33% to $735 million, which exceed the company' prior target of $500 million for the year.GrubHub also post solid guidance. It expect it first quarter revenu to rise 32%-39%, and it full-year revenu to grow 26%-34%. On the bottom line, Grubhub expect it EBITDA to rise 14%-30% for the first quarter, and 14%-31% for the full year. All those figur match analyst expectations.Thre reason to sell GrubhubFirst and foremost,Amazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) restaur deliveri service, which is free for Prime members, representsa grow threatto GrubHub. Amazon launch the servic in late 2015, and it ha sinc expand to 19 major citi across the U.S. Last June, research firm CIRP claim that Amazon' Prime user base in the U.S. had grown 43% annual to 63 million. As Amazon strengthen the bond between Prime Now deliveries, Echo speakers, and the rest of it ecosystem, GrubHub' servic could be marginalized.To counter Amazon and other rival in the crowd food deliveri market, GrubHub plan to spend more money on tech, sales, and marketing. Dure the quarter, it hire about 40 engin and analyt expert from Zoomer to boost the effici of it driver network efficiency, and it plan to boost it sale and market spend by over 20% thi year. Those move will weigh down it margins, which had been gradual improv sinc it IPO.Source:YChartsThat bottom line pressur is troubling, becaus GrubHub' valuat is pretti lofty. Analyst expect Grubhub' non-GAAP earn to grow 26% thi year, but that isn't high enough to justifi it trail P/E of 75, which is much higher than the industri averag of 50 for internet inform providers. GrubHub' forward P/E of 35 look cheaper, but it mere match it project growth rate for the year.Th verdict: Avoid Grubhub for nowGrubHub ha been a solid growth stock over the past year, but it rise expenses, slow bottom line growth, valuations, and vulner to Amazon indic that it ha more downsid potenti than upsid potential. Therefore, I think GrubHub might go higher, but the risk outweigh the reward at current prices.10 stock we like better than GrubhubWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Snap, Inc. Is Also Spending $1 Billion With Amazon AWS;2/9/2017;"Earlier today,Snap(NYSE: SNAP) file it first amend S-1 with the Secur and Exchang Commission. Compani often modifi their initi registr statement lead up to their IPOs, prior to issu a formal prospectus. Prospect investor alreadi knew that Snap is a big spender atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl Cloud, which it reli on for it cloud infrastructur needs.Snap is uniqu in it continu use of third-parti infrastructur vendorsat the scale at which it is operating; most compani invest in their own infrastructur onc they grow to a point where it' warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap also purchas infrastructur servic fromAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();In the amend filing, Snap provid some addit detail on it relationship with the e-commerc giant.Alway have a conting planTo be clear, Googl Cloud is still Snap' main flame, but it never hurt to have backup. In fact, conting plan is absolut critic when your entir servic reli on third-parti infrastructur partners, and thi is the role that AW will play. The deal wa ink just yesterday, which is what' trigger the S-1 amendment.In last week' version, Snap said: ""We are current negoti an agreement with anoth cloud provid for redund infrastructur support of our busi operations."" That line wa replac in thi week' version with: ""We have also commit to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Servic over the next five year for redund infrastructur support of our busi operations."" Snap say an exist agreement with AW that wa origin enter into in March 2016 wa amend on Feb. 8, 2017.That $1 billion commit will slowli ramp up, start with $50 million in spend thi year. That' a tini drop in the bucket compar to the $12.2 billion in sale that AW did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AW in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Googl Cloud that wa final on Jan. 30, 2017 call for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a littl bit of leeway in shift spend to subsequ year (up to 15% in each of the first four years).Data source: Snapchat amend S-1. Chart by author.Combin with it $2 billion commit with Googl Cloud, we'r look at $3 billion pledg between Googl Cloud and AW over the next five years. Snap' cloud strategi of reli entir on third-parti partner is riski for mani oper reasons, but that' an aw lot of financi pressur for the start-up. In 2016, cost of revenu exceed revenue, result in a neg gross profit of nearli $50 million, and infrastructur cost are the largest compon of cost of revenue.Snap onli recent roll out it autom ad sale API in October, which exit beta just a coupl week ago. The compani will now need to ramp ad sale faster than it infrastructur spend commit if it hope to gener gross profit in the year ahead. And we haven't even start talk about oper expens yet, which total $473 million last year.Hopefully, that API work pretti darn well.10 stock we like better than Snap Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Are These 3 Dividend Stocks Too Cheap to Buy?;2/9/2017;"Incom seeker get paid to invest when they buy into dividend-pay stocks. Who wouldn't want that? Get a good deal on a stock' price simpli add to the valu that accru from search out cheap stock that reward sharehold with healthi payouts.But there might be time when there' too much of a good thing -- a dividend stock that' so cheap it may be a trap. Consider, for example,Barn & Noble(NYSE: BKS) ,Bed Bath & Beyond(NASDAQ: BBBY) , andGameStop(NYSE: GME) . They all pay dividends, and the market is broadli discount them, but investor might want to think twice befor buy in. Read on to see why.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Barn & NobleOn the surface, pick up share of Barn & Nobl doesn't seem like such a bad idea. Trade at around $10 a share, the bookseller' $0.60 annual dividend current yield a hefti 6%, and though it payout ratio stand at an astronom 300% base on earnings, view through the len of the free cash flow it produces, it' a much more reason 49%. Yet anyon who know even the slightest thing about the book market understand that Barn & Nobl is oper on unstabl ground.In it fiscal second quarter, the booksel said sale fell 4% to $858.8 million, as comparable-stor sale fell 3.2% becaus of lower custom traffic, which pretti much explain the industri as a whole.Even though the book industri is grow (surprise!), the buy of book continu to move online, which remain the top sale channel for publishers' revenu in the trade category. Accord to the Associ of American Publishers, onlin hold a 37.4% share of the market. It also say there is a return to hardcov book as consum move away from e-books, which peak in 2013 but have sinc fallen away and now compris around 17% of the market.Barn & Nobl wa famous upend byAmazon.com, which also caus the demis of Borders, and it enterpris valu now trade at just 9.8 time it free cash flow, a bargain-bas price. But with a busi model stand on shaki ground that may be riski for it earn growth, such a high payout for the dividend it pay make it a riski read.Imag source: Bed Bath & Beyond.B Bath & BeyondHome-good retail Bed Bath & Beyond ha an even more heavili discount EV/FCF ratio of just 7.8, but like the book business, it home-furnish busi is also be displac by the onlin market. And where Barn & Nobl at least had tri to respond by get into the e-read business, Bed Bath & Beyond larg neglect e-commerc until rel recently. Now it' in hurry-up mode to make up for lost time, plow signific resourc into the effort and go on a shop spree.Last June, it purchas die flash-sal site One King Lane, and in Novemb it bought PersonalizationMall.com, a seller of individu person gift items. These aren't particularli materi purchases, but they'r not big sale winners, either. And though it digit customer-fac channel grew 20% in the third quarter, the gain weren't nearli enough to offset the declin in it brick-and-mortar locations.Manag say it earn have been trap in a moribund rang of around $4.50 to $5.00 per share for sever year now becaus of invest made in the business, and cash balanc that routin ran north of $1 billion now total less than half of that amount.It' also have troubl lure custom into it stores, as itsprodigi coupon effortsno longer gener the same respons they onc did. Instead, they onli weigh on earnings. It is still abl to gener signific amount of free cash flow, but an investor might have to wait a long time befor the busi turn around, if ever. It dividend payment is new, have just been initi last year, and it yield just 0.3% -- suggest it might not be worth the effort to invest in the stock simpli for it payout.GameStopVideo-gam retail GameStop suffer a disappoint Christma season, as sale tumbl 16% from the year-ago period while compar sale plung almost 19% on weak sale of onc strong titl such asCal of DutyandTitanfall. As with everyon els on thi list, it in-stor traffic fell.Th game consol market is in a state of flux as it transit to a digit distribut format. The transit is obvious hurt sale of physic games, but it' also affect the trade-in market. GameStop' respons ha been to enter into the mobile-phon and collect market, and though revenu in the segment grew better than 37% in the last quarter, it still account for less than 6% of revenue. And so mani troubl retail -- RadioShack, anyone? -- have place their hope on have cell phone save them, onli to be sore disappointed.GameStop is anoth retail that' still abl to produc hand of free cash flow, gener $451 million worth over the last 12 months, which mean it enterpris valu is at a minuscul 6.5. A $1.48 annual dividend yield 6.1%, and an earnings-bas payout ratio of 39% (34% base on free cash flow), make it tempt to take a bite here just to play along.However, with GameStop' main game busi move away from it even as it oper a larg footprint of 7,600 stores, all while it' bet on new revenu stream that have noth to do with it area of expertise, investor would do better look elsewher for a dividend-pay stock.10 stock we like better than Bed Bath and BeyondWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA I write this,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock trade at about $824 per share. For 2017, analyst consensu estim are that AMZN stock will earn $7.25 per share for the full year. That give Amazon stock an astronom forward price-to-earn ratio of nearli 62x. In comparison, theS&P 500a a whole trade at about 17x next year' earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn other words, AMZN stock trade at a multiplenearli six timesthat of the averag large-cap U.S. stock.Of course, thi isn't a new phenomenon: For years, investor have consid Amazon stock overvalu base on a P/E ratio that ha often been in the tripl digit - and, not all that long ago, negative.Yet AMZN stock seem to defi gravity: Share are up 50% over the past year, 110% over the past three year and a stun 340% over the past five years. The reason is that Amazon isn't a stock that should be valu sole on next year' earnings, or the price investor are pay for those earnings. That' not becaus the market is crazi when it come to AMZN stock and it' not becaus the fundament ""don't matter"". It' becaus Amazon is invest now for growth later - and that' exactli what itshouldb doing.AMZN' Earn Aren't the Onli ThingIt' tempt to think that a stock with a lower P/E ratio is by definit ""cheaper"" than other stocks. Whi would an investor pay 50x, or 100x, a year' earn when he or she could pay 15x, or 10x? Growth certainli matters.7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendIntuitively, an investor understand that 18x earn for a bad busi isn't obvious better than, say, 22x earn for a good business. In fact, it may be worse. But the P/E ratio for Amazon stock seem ridicul on it face. AMZN is alreadi the biggest retail in the world; is it realli go to show so much growth that it' worth pay a 100x P/E? It would have to grow it profit by a factor of five just to get the multipl to 20x, which doesn't sound cheap itself.However, that type of analysi is gener too simplistic. A stock is valu base on the sum ofallit futur cash flow - not just next year's. That' true for AMZN stock, and it' true forMacy' Inc(NYSE:M) stock as well.Th fact that AMZN trade at 62x 2017 earn and M trade at 10x doesn't, in and of itself, prove anything. It seem almost certain that the earn and cash flow attribut to AMZN stock will continu to rise; it seem highli like that Macy' earn will, in contrast, fall. The rate at which those earn rise or declin matters, of course, and those rate inform how investor valu AMZN stock or M stock.But whether a stock is valu at 100x P/E or 3x P/E, investor need to take a long-term outlook. And while it may not appear like it at first glance, that' exactli what mani AMZN stock holder are doing.Th Two Way For Amazon Stock to Grow EarningsEven those investor who are mostli bearish on Amazon stock would like admit that Amazon' earn will continu to grow go forward. But the bearish argument - one that ha been made for the better part of a decad - is that it' almost imposs for AMZN earn to growthat much. After all, as a compani get bigger, it growth rate fades, simpli due to it size. (SeeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for a perfect example.)At some point, the optim that keep Amazon stock at noseble level will fade - and AMZN stock will come back to Earth.But that argument assum that Amazon is at noseble levels, which may not be the case. The heavy-hand P/E ratio sound highli stretched; however, accord to AMZN' most recent 10-Q, it gener $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That impli a sub-50x multipl to free cash flow ona trail basi -a slightli less intimid multiple. And the focu on P/E ratio also ignor that there are two way for Amazon to grow earnings.Th first is the standard way that compani grow earnings: higher sale and better margins. There' littl reason, bar an econom recession, to see AMZN' sale declining. Even then, increas market share could allow Amazon to post revenu growth, if not at the 29% pace seen through the first three quarter of 2016.There' also reason to see AMZN' margin expand considerably. Somewhat incredibly, on a GAAP basis, Amazon' oper margin year-to-d is just 3.2%. Yet the compani ha built out an incred distribut platform and it ha invest billion of dollar in it Amazon Web Servic business. Increment sale thu should boost margin considerably; it take veri littl in the way of invest to sell a few more items, or add anoth cloud customer.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAMZN still ha year of benefit from the scale it ha built out, and those benefit will continu to expand margin for some time, allow for steady, and even explos earn and cash flow growth.Th second issu rel to current and 2017 earn is that Amazon isn't current maxim it profits. Rather, it is spend - sometim wildli - on a varieti of initiatives, offer everyth from restaur deliveri to photo print to Prime Video and Prime Music subscriptions.Som of those effort will work; mani like will fail. But look at 2016 and 2017 earn and not consid the impact of that spend is as short-term as buy AMZN stock in 2017 simpli becaus it rose in 2016. Amazon' oper expens are on pace to increas almost $10 billion year-over-year in 2016. A good chunk of that is come from hire employees, market the new busi and creat the distribut platform for variou projects.Assume, then, that AMZN decid to focu on near-term earnings, instead of invest now for the future. Simpli limit that increas to $5 billion would come close todoublingAmazon' earn and cash flow next year. Ignor that new spend ignor the 'true' earn power of AMZN stock.Bottom Line on AMZN Stock: It' ComplicatedThi is not to say that Amazon stock is necessarili a buy. As a valu investor myself, I still question the valuat of AMZN stock in my own way. But simpli check the P/E ratio for AMZN - or ani other stock - is too simplistic. Tri to valu Amazon stock is a messy, difficult, detail endeavor. The Amazon Web Servic busi is vastli differ from the price-sensitive, low-margin, onlin retail business. It' not clear how much AMZN is spend on it new projects, and how much it could save.It' complicated. But so is invest the right way. And simpli ignor - or short - Amazon stock becaus of it P/E ratio isn't the right way to do it. There are reason to be optimistic, and pessimistic, toward AMZN stock, but those reason go well beyond a singl number.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenTh postAmazon.com Inc.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers;2/9/2017;"One of the mani interest detail reveal inSnap' S-1 file with the SEC is that it agre to a $2 billion contract with Googl Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiari span five year with rel equal payment schedul for everi year.Snap ha use Googl Cloud sinc it creation, but had been spend consider less than the $400 million per year it' slate to spend through 2021. For the first few year of it existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Googl Cloud. Last year, however, it start see it host cost increas considerably, up $192 million for the year.Imag Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google' cloud servic compet against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Servic andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infus could help it catch up to the competition.What doe $2 billion mean to Googl Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactli forthright with it cloud revenue. It lump Googl Cloud in with Google' other revenu line item, which also includ Googl Play and hardwar sales. In 2016, the three categori produc $10.1 billion in revenue. Googl Play like account for the bulk of revenue.Th cloud unit had an estim run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, accord to RBC Capital. Snap' new contract like make it Google' biggest cloud customer.Whil Googl ha made sever advanc in it cloud servic over the past year, so have it competitors. Microsoft boast that it Azur revenu increas 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estim the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein' Mark Mordler estim Azure' run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just report AW sale top $12 billion in 2016. Sale surpass $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analyst expectations.Googl still need to diversifyTh growth of Snapchat ha been a major boon to Google' cloud services, but it' still activ seek to pull custom away from it competitor and take market share. The hire of cloud-comput veteran Dian Green to lead the divis ha help the compani attract numer high-profil customers, but there' still more work to do.On Alphabet' fourth-quart earn call, Googl CEO Sundar Pichai said, ""We have truli differenti offer in four key areas: data analyt and machin learning, secur and privacy, tool for applic development, and the abil to creat connect busi platforms."" Snap can take advantag of at least three of those four factors, so it' clear whi it wa will to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap want to enter China, for example, where Googl doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google' competitors. Or it could build it own servers.Snap recent hire Jerri Hunter from AWS, who ran global data center for the cloud-comput giant. In Snap' S-1 filing, manag notes, ""In the future, we may invest in build our own infrastructur to better serv our customers.""If Snap continu to grow at the pace it ha been for the last few years, it may make econom sens for it to switch to it own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What thi mean for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggl room: The contract say it can postpon up to 15% of expens for a year, so it onli ha to spend $340 million thi first year. Still, that' a huge amount for a compani that gener just $404.5 million in revenu last year.It also mean that switch servic provid will be difficult, consid it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leav at least some of it oper on Googl Cloud in order not to wast the money. That make the econom of build out it own infrastructur within the next five year even costlier.On the flip side, analyst expect Snap' revenu to continu grow at a rapid pace, approach $1 billion thi year fuel by continu user growth and product expans that will sure put addit demand on Google' servers. It ha plenti of capit to cover the expense, and if last year' growth is ani indic of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructur thi year. The deal with Googl ensur that it get the lowest rate possible, so it can to make the most of it spend.Overall, it' not a bad deal for Snap, but it doe tie the compani to Googl for a long time.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At least one analyst ha boost hi price target for AAPL stock base on the record iPhon unit number in the Decemb quarter.AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per ShareCanaccord Genuityanalyst T. Michael Walkley rais hi price target for Appl stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note date Feb. 6. He feel the compani took a ""strong share"" of the premium end of the world' smartphon market dure the Decemb quarter, as it gener 92% of profits.That is a declin from 106% of the profit in the Septemb quarter, however, becauseSAMSUNG ELECTRONIC' (SSNLF) profit improv after the Galaxi Note 7 recall.Appl sold 78.3 million iPhon with an averag sell price of $695 dure it first fiscal quarter as consum prefer the more expens iPhon 7 Plu models. Walkley also believ the iPhon maker benefit from the Note 7 recall-although there wa some debat about that befor the result were released. Appl manag said the quarter had the highest quarterli number of switcher from Android, someth that third-parti data indic just befor the release.Th analyst also expect the iPhon 7 lineup to continu do well, bridg the gap until the iPhon 8 is released, probabl in September.Despit Walkley' (and almost everyon else's) enthusiasm about Appl stock, Neil George, a contributor forTh Street,feel investor are do noth more but attend the ""church of Apple.""Here' How Appl Inc.

Accord to Kee, to make up for that extra week, the compani would have had to report about $3.53 per share in earn rather than the $3.38 per share it reported.H also estim that revenu should have been about $81 billion rather than the $78.4 billion that wa reported. Base on hi weekli calculations, the compani grew at a 4.11% slower rate in the most recent Decemb quarter than it did in the same quarter in 2015. Kee argu that Apple' growth rate contract rather than grew in the most recent complet quarter and that it onli look like it did becaus of that extra week.Georg highlight other ""problems"" he see at Appl as well, like the contract gross margin, which fell to 38.5% from 40.1% in the year-ago period. The iPhon maker also saw it sale in China, the world' biggest market, fall 12% in the Decemb quarter, reduc it market share there to 9.6%. He said the company' global market share ha fallen as well, down to 11.5%.Appl is wide expect to launch the tenth anniversari edit of it smartphon under the iPhon 8 moniker, and most firm have been call thi cycl a ""supercycle"" becaus they'r expect tremend growth.However, one analyst that' been call for a supercycl is start to back off from that theori and suggest now that the next cycl will be one of ""smooth"" growth rather than anyth of the ""super"" variety.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialUBSanalyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note date Feb. 7 that he' now ""smoothing"" out hi assumpt for iPhon growth over the next coupl of year and adopt ""less of asupercycleview"" for fiscal 2018.""

That' a rather lofti multiple, and it essenti mean that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickli surg share price could take a similarli speedi tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia oper in some of the most excit growth area for semiconductors. The compani is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular it graphic process units, or GPUs. The compani boast it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. Thi look accur - a recentBarron'sarticlepeg it GPU market share at 68%. Thi is one of the most compel space in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia' chip are an integr compon in the ecosystem that are pioneer growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machin learning, and self-driv cars. These are some huge disrupt industri that could end up revolution mani facet of the gaming, computing, and automot industries.Th company' game busi is the largest oper unit and grow 30% per year on averag sinc 2013. It data center busi (to support cloud computing) is expand at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automot is skyrocket 75% annually, though from a veri small initi base.In some respects, and provid you are comfort with the lofti valuation, Nvidia is a veri compel way for broad exposur to multipl disrupt industries.NVDA add exposur to the cloud-comput excit that is creat a buzz at giant tech firm includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole posit in the autonom automobil charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 comput platform current power the Tesla auto model that alreadi have self-driv capabilities.Th CompetitionMor direct competitor includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are look to grow in these newer markets. Both key rival are also like to benefit from GPU use to power game systems, machin learning, and server use for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from it domin market share in person computing. It 80% market share to power person comput and relat devic ha liter result in hundr of billion of dollar in cash flow over the past sever decades. Thi give it unmatch rivalri to invest in new technolog and keep a leadership posit over chip competitors. But comput is matur and bare expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Sock the Short With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost it way. Year of mismanag allow Intel to expand on it domin and nearli put AMD out of business. But new manag appear to have reinvigor AMD, and investor are start to believ it can also benefit from the same market Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arec interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni peg semiconductor stock as one of hi favorit industri for 2017. In hi words, ""we'r talk about major secular disrupt in autos, consum electronics, and gaming."" Chip that power data warehous to serv the rise in cloud comput repres yet anoth market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor' best bet to gain exposur to these markets. The rub, of course, is it valuat alreadi reflect mani more year of rapid growth.AMD is an interest turnaround play, though with it current low level of profitability, the trade multipl are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. It forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest take a wait-and-se approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is like to impress, but given the lofti valuation, ani hiccup in the expect could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.A of thi writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Appl Inc. iPhon 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)Th 10 Best Index Fund for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corpor (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appear first onInvestorPlace."
What Is Unearned Revenue, and Why Should Amazon Investors Care About It?;2/9/2017;"A small line item onAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balanc sheet ha been grow rapidli over the past coupl years. Sinc the end of 2014, Amazon' unearn revenu liabil increas from $1.8 billion to $4.8 billion. Some investor might see a grow liabil and think that' bad news, but in fact thi is veri good news.Unearn revenu is simpli cash custom have paid to Amazon in advanc for servic it ha yet to render. For example, Prime member typic pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day ship program. Amazon immedi take the cash and put it on it balanc sheet, but it amort the $99 of revenu over the 12 month of the membership. So it account for onli $8.25 per month in revenu per month for each Prime member. The rest of the cash receiv for Prime is held in the unearned-revenu balance.Prim growth ha been veri good over the past few years. Amazon say it ad ""ten of millions"" of new member last year. But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearn revenue. More likely, Amazon Web Servic (AWS) is the biggest factor push the balanc higher.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Mayb last quarter wasn't so disappointingFor the first time sinc Amazon start break out AW revenu and income, the cloud-comput segment miss analysts' expectations. Sale total $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, where analyst were expect $3.6 billion on average.But unearn revenu climb $568 million from the previou quarter. That' unusu for Amazon' fourth quarter. Usually, unearn revenu spike in the first quarter as cloud custom presum re-up short-term contract for the year.Most of Amazon' AW custom are small busi use it pay-as-you-go pricing, which allow them to quickli scale their use. The solut work well for compani with small or unpredict user bases.But a lot of AWS' money come from the big enterpris that spend hundr of million everi year on cloud computing. For those companies, with more predict usag needs, Amazon offer ""reserv instances,"" which offer a discount if custom pay up front. Growth in reserv instances, or other long-term contracts, may have result in lower revenu in the short term, but it nearli guarante revenu in the future.Lock in customersA the competit for cloud-comput infrastructur continu to heat up, long-term contract may prove invaluable. Lock in custom for a rel long term mean those enterpris will start optim their code so that it run more effici on the specif hardwar and platform they'r using.Such is the case withSnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which use Google' cloud. In it S-1 filing, Snap say it built it app to use ""servic provid by Google, some of which do not have an altern in the market,"" asRe/Code'sPet Guagenti point out. Not onli did Snap just agre to a $2 billion five-year contract with Google, but it' also go to be hard for it to leav Googl even after the five year is up. That' excel news forAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excel for Snap investors.Ultimately, sign long-term contract provid a moat against the grow competition. Not onli doe it lock in custom for the length of the contract, but it could also lock them in longer if they becom depend on certain featur of a cloud platform.

The idea is that higher yield are a signal of a beaten-up share price - and that becaus we'r buy a stabl blue-chip with a stabl custom base, investor will eventu bid the stock back up when the busi cycl turn up again.makeArticleAd();But we can further improv on thi effect yet somewhat ""dumb"" strategi with a bit of second-level analysis.Aft all, some of these compani have busi model that are actual age in dog years!And they should be avoided.Today we'r go to discuss four high pay Dow dividend stock components. Two are compel buys, while two should be sold immedi (or even shorted).12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenLet' get started…WINNER: Exxon Mobil Corpor (XOM)Dividend Yield:3.6%Exxon Mobil Corporation(XOM) is emerg from what easili ha been one of the most tri point in the company' history, the root of which stretch all the way back to 1870.From about mid-2014 through the start of 2016, oil price plung from near $110 down to below $30 - a collaps that caus energi stock across the sector to careen into the ground, and forc numer compani to shut their doors.Even Exxon Mobil - America' biggest energi compani by market capitalization, and one of the world' largest and most diversifi oil and ga oper - wasn't immune. Share dip from around $105 to around $72 or so - a 30%-plu dip in just more than a year' time, which is virtual unheard of in blue chip as well-establish as XOM. Pundit thought that Exxon' streak of dividend increases, which span more than three decades, wa in jeopardy.However, former CEO Rex Tillerson himself manag the compani in such a way that he knew it oper could surviv with oil price as low as $40 per barrel. April 2016 came around, and XOM maintain it statu as a Dividend Aristocrat with a small but symbol payout hike. Meanwhile, XOM share have claw back at least some of their losses.Speak of Tillerson …The former Exxon CEO is a ""former"" chief becaus he' now America' Secretari of State. That' no doubt a boon to XOM, especi consid the Trump administration' seemingli favor and cooper view with Russia - where Exxon ha huge energi interest and projects, and where Tillerson himself ha deep ties.Moreover, Presid Donald Trump and a GOP-control Congress are prove extrem friendli to the energi sector as a whole right now, most recent with a Senat vote to knock down a rule govern transpar on energi firms' payment to foreign governments.Exxon wa alreadi set up well to benefit from an eventu return to high oil prices, and now it' seemingli in the driver' seat. While investor wait for those gain to take hold, they can enjoy 3.6% in dividend from thi relentless oil titan.Exxon (XOM): Thi Long-Tim Winner Is in Recoveri ModeLOSER: Wal-Mart Store Inc (WMT)Dividend Yield:3%Wal-Mart Store Inc(WMT) is one of the perfect exampl of how a big, solid blue-chip can still be a big, solid dud.Walmart is the largest retail in the world, and in fact Earth' biggest compani by revenue, boast more than 11,000 store across 28 countries. BeforeAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) came around, Walmart wa consid one of the biggest disruptor to tradit brick-and-mortar retail. It bargain-bas price and enorm product offer upend countless mom 'n' pop shops, but also put the hurt to larger specialti retail such asBest Buy Co Inc(BBY) andhhgregg, Inc.(HGG).But Amazondidcom along, and that - along with Walmart' ubiqu and lack of option for expans - are at the veri least keep Walmart from be the invest powerhous it onc was.Whil WMT doe produc world-class revenues, top-lin growth ha been thin for years, and in 2016, Walmart' sale actual drop year-over-year:Walmart ha been spend for year tri to bring it onlin offer up to par to battl Amazon' unstopp e-commerc machin - yet it just keep fall farther behind. Dividend growth is lag too - last year manag up it payout by a meager 2%.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in FebruaryWMT ha lag the total return of the S&P 500 for the last 15 year - it' time to cut thi dead weight loose.WINNER: Boe Co (BA)Dividend Yield:3.5%Bo Co(BA) just boost it dividend by 30% to $1.42 per share - more than doubl it quarterli payout from 2013! And Boeing' generos to sharehold didn't stop there.Th compani also upgrad it old stock repurchas program by implement a new $14 billion buyback plan.Futur busi prospect are look good. Boe said it expect 2017 commerci aircraft deliveri to reach between 760 and 765, up from last year' 748.Core earn are expect to surg from $7.24 per share to a rang of $9.10 to $9.30 per share.And Boe see cash flow tick up from $10.5 billion last year to $10.75 billion in 2017 - plenti of cash to dish back to shareholders.Boeing' (BA) Dividend Take OffLOSER: Intern Busi Machin Corp.

(IBM) core businesses, such as servic and softwar licenses, have declin on a year-over-year basi for 19 straight quarters. And it' a bad sign that the compani still won't break out it Watson revenues, despit the fact IBM say it promis artifici intellig unit is grow briskly.IBM' 2016 dividend hike dip into singl digit after year of double-digit improvements. Cash and short-term invest have dip from about $11 billion in 2013 to $8.5 billion as of it last report … and long-term debt ha climb from $32.9 billion to $34.7 billion in that same time.And that streak of consecut revenu declines?If Wall Street is right, it'll be extend at least by a coupl more quarters, and both 2017 and 2018 revenu are seen eroding, not recovering.IBM might surviv for an eternity, but it won't grow your money for you.IBM (IBM) Revenu Just Keep SinkingTh Best 7% Dividend for 2017Everi portfolio ha room for Dow Jone stalwart like Boe and Exxon Mobil that will throw off seriou dividend and actual help grow your nest egg in the process.But Boe and especi Exxon Mobil could see some signific move in either direct depend on how the wind in Washington blow over the next few years.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improv your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it ha been lethal for investors. Dure the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrend 60%. Thi is certainli anoth case studi of how high-profil IPO can quickli come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a valu play here?A I'v written variou time for InvestorPlace, it' probabl not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a compani that develop a product that realli is not a must-have. Accord to a recent studi fromGartner, the abandon rate on fit tracker is 30%. The most common reason for thi include: user either get bore or the devic breaks!Th conclus from the report: ""Dropout from devic usag is a seriou problem for the industry. The abandon rate is quit high rel to the usag rate. To offer a compel enough valu proposition, the use for wearabl devic need to be distinct from what smartphon typic provide. Wearabl maker need to engag user with incent and gamification.""Th Other Problem for FIT StockBut thi is definit not the onli major issu with Fitbit stock. Let' face it, the competit environ remain intense. The compani must fight against tough rival likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Appl Watch, which is still in the earli phases.7 Stock That Will Drop by 10% or More Thi QuarterIn light of all this, is it ani wonder that Wall Street is concern with FIT stock? Of cours not.Mor importantly, the compani is alreadi report major problems, as seen with the latest warn on fourth-quart earnings. Fitbit' guidanc call for a loss of 51 cent to 56 cent a share on revenu of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast wa for earn of 14 cent to 18 cent a share and revenu of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it look like the holiday season turn out to be a disast for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situat isexpect to continue. The full-year predict is for revenu of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cent to 44 cent a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, wa look for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-lin and profit of 64 cent a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT ha a plan that look weak. The compani expect to reduc the workforc by mere 6% and to take other vagu effort to reduc oper costs, leverag data and launch product into new categories. Interest enough, Fitbit want to focu more on the smartwatch market, but thi will like mean more expenses.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO Jame Parksaidthat the issu with the compani were ""temporary"" and the ""perform is not reflect of the valu of our brand, market-lead platform, and company' long-term potential.""Huh? Well, thi realli doe seem like the talk of someon who is out-of-touch. And thi should definit be omin for holder of FIT stock.Granted, perhap there may be a buyout. But when it come to broken hardwar companies, thi may be wish thinking. For example, think about how long the rumor for a purchas of the beleagueredBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be veri interest to a suitor. And thi is not becaus the product are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simpl as that the market ha hit matur level and that big player like AAPL stand to captur a big part of what' available.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbook.

Snap, Inc. Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work?;2/8/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be lead the grow market for cloud infrastructure, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still put up a fight.Cloud infrastructur vendor have been crucial in enabl smaller start-ups, particularli those that are build mobil apps, to get up and run without have to worri as much about the back end. It' an appeal model sinc it allow smaller compani to simpli pay for what they need without have to invest in build the infrastructur themselves. In other words, it' an OpEx model versu a CapEx model, andGoogl is bet bigthat the market is go to shift to the OpEx model in a major way in the year ahead.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();But as compani grow, they often choos to invest in their own cloud infrastructure. Thi give them much more control over their own destinies, reduc risk, and over time the cost effici improv after the larg upfront investment.Soci media peersFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andTwitterboth oper their own data centers; Facebook announc itsseventh data centera few month back, while Twitter' infrastructur oper are expand more slowly, as it oper in co-loc facilities. Data center are so strateg import to Facebook that it help creat the Open Comput Project back in 2011, publicli share Facebook' infrastructur innov for the greater good.But notSnap(NYSE: SNAP) .Hey, big spenderSnap primarili reli on Googl Cloud for it infrastructur needs. While thi is entir par for the cours for mobil app start-ups, Snap ha grown to a size (nearli 160 million daili activ users) that would typic warrant invest in infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap' use of Googl Cloud is what' unpreced here. The Inform report that Googl land Snap with numer discount and other benefits, and Snap veri much reli on Googl Cloud at thi point, although it also use Amazon' AW to a lesser degree.Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobbi Murphi said the compani pick Googl Cloud over AW becaus the compani could scale better on Googl Cloud. Snap poach AWS' head of data center in Octob of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may impli that Snap ha longer-term ambit to build out it own infrastructure.But for now, Snap is firmli in bed with Googl Cloud, and spend quit a bit of money. Infrastructur cost compris the bulk of Snap' cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenu consist primarili of payment to third-parti infrastructur partner for host our products. Host cost primarili includ expens relat to bandwidth, computing, and storag costs."" Cost of revenu in 2016 wa $452 million, and Snap ha commit to spend $2 billion with Googl Cloud over the next five years.But at what cost?In discuss it oper leverage, Snap believ that use a capital-light busi model will translat into ""lower cost for us in both the short and long term."" That' definit true in the short term, but much more debat in the long term.Hav a larger proport of fix cost actual help with oper leverag as the busi grows, sinc those fix cost get spread out over an increas revenu base over time, reduc total averag costs. In contrast, if a company' cost structur ha a larger proport of variabl costs, those cost will scale commensur with revenue, so you don't get as much margin expansion. It' alreadi tell that Snap' cost of revenueexceededrevenu in 2016 ($405 million), result in neg gross margin.W saw thi all play out year ago in the semiconductor industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" model that are domin today. Build a chip fab cost billion of dollars, which wa a signific barrier to entry. Then contract chip manufactur came around and allow compani to focu more on design the chip while the manufactur partner would produc them. By outsourc product to a few larg chip manufacturers, the industri collect save billion and innov flourished. Semiconductor mostli shift to the OpEx model long ago, and there are onli a hand of compani that current manufactur their own chip these days.Snap is wade into unchart territori by reli on third-parti infrastructur partner at thi scale. Whether or not thi prove right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grow from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspir start-up and infrastructur vendor will be watch close to see how thi experi unfolds.10 stock we like better than SnapWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt ha been a rough ride forFireEy Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) stock. FEY stock went public in Septemb 2013, price at $20 per share. FireEy doubl on it first day of trading; it clear $90 by March. A quick plung followed, and after a modest rebound, share have been in a consist downtrend, fall from abov $50 in June 2015 to a current price around $11.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)With FEY stock now near an all-tim low, investor are look to see if there' a way to salvag some value.FireEy itself ha been in the middl of a turnaround, to be sure. The compani ha cut costs, and work to shift from legaci hardwar product to a more cloud-bas model. But the departur of the chairman and CFO after last week' Q4 earn report could hamper those plans. Already, restructur ha left sever key posit open and affect FireEye' sale and market efforts.Ther is a case for the compani to be a takeov target, which almost certainli would valu FEY stock abov current levels. But investor expect a deal in the near-term seem like to be disappointed. FireEy could be of interest to a larger player, but it still ha a lot of work to do.What FireEy Need To DoIt' alway tempt to see a M&A opportun in a growth stock that ha fallen on hard times. Accord to aBloombergreport last year, FireEy alreadi ha turn down sever buyout offers. Those deal almost certainli would have been struck at a price much higher than $11. Surely, the rumor buyer - among themIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) - would still be interest at a lower price?12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenTh problem, however, is that FEYE' busi look much wors than it did even six month ago. 2016 as a whole doesn't look that bad, to be sure: Revenu increas 15% over 2015, and the compani manag to cut non-GAAP oper expens by 3% at the same time. That combin move FireEy closer to profitability: The non-GAAP loss narrow from $1.61 per share to $0.99 per share.Thos number don't show the real issue, however. Billings, which reflect revenu ad in the quarter - not necessarili recogn sale - increas just 3% for the year. More concerning: That figur becam progress wors as the year went on. In Q1, bill growth wa over 20%; in Q3, the figur increas just 4%. Q4 bill then declin 14% and the midpoint of Q1 guidanc impli a 25% decreas next quarter.Noth good will happen for FEY stock until that trend is reversed. Acquir don't want to buy a declin business. FireEy is alreadi both unprofit and burn cash. Declin bill will onli worsen it losses. And FEY can't blame it market. PeerFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) announc 22% bill growth in it first quarter on the same day FEY stock wa plung after it report. To be even consid as an M&A target with a market cap still over $2 billion, FireEy ha to fix it sale problems.Can FEY Stock Rebound Through M&A?For it part, FireEy manag believ those issu will be fixed. After Q4, outgo CFO Mike Berri said the compani would return to growth in the second half of 2017. New cloud-bas offer and the recent roll out Helix platform are project to start boost sale by then.Th huge declin in product bill - down 50% in Q4, and guid the same in Q1 - will start to be lapped. And CEO Kevin Mandia point out on the Q4 call that FireEy for month had no head of sales, either worldwid or in Europe.Combin with easi comparisons, FEY expect to get back to bill growth toward the end of thi year, which like would translat into revenu growth in earli 2018. But until that happens, it' hard to expect much in the way of M&A interest.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingWhil FireEy seem confid in it prospects, the price of FEY stock show that mani observ remain skeptical. The compani is shift from product to clouds, but there' a real concern that it' ""too little, too late,"" with rival like Fortinet andPalo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) have beaten FireEy to market.Ani sale of FEY is go to depend on that top-lin rebound take place. Lower spend is nice in the near-term, but isn't go to be the primari consider of a strateg acquir like IBM or Cisco. A larger compani look to enter the cybersecur market through a takeout of FireEy stock is go to plan for substanti cost cut regardless. Whether FEY make those cut in 2017 or IBM doe so in 2019 doesn't much chang the possibl of a takeov - or the price to be paid for FireEy stock.Simpli put, it' revenu that will drive FEYE' attract as an M&A target. Thus, it' revenu that will drive the perform of FireEy stock thi year. Sale perform seem to hing on whether the compani succe in pivot away from it legaci applianc business. That put a lot of pressur on Helix, in particular. The platform may rise to the challenge, to be sure. But ani investor expect a takeout of FEY stock should at the least, be patient. FireEy ha a lot to prove befor bigger compani come calling.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February7 Dividend Growth Stock on Sale TodayTh postCan FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvag Some Valu Through a Sale?appear first onInvestorPlace."

While payment process repres a small portion of the onlin retailer' oper cost (fall under it fulfil expenses), everi penni counts. Through the first nine month of 2016, the oper margin for Amazon' retail oper wa just 0.7%.While Amazon use third-parti servic to process credit cards, PayPal' take rate is significantli higher than the standard process fee of tradit back-end payment processors. PayPal' standard fee is 2.9% plu $0.30 for U.S. transactions, and 3.9% plu a fix fee for intern payments.

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt seem unlik that from a fundament standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earn report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora alreadi announc last month that fourth-quart result would come in ahead of guidanc for both revenu and adjust Ebitda. That disclosur sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibl that the number in the Pandora earn report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news come out of Pandora earnings. The compani ha set itself up for a busi 2017. The replac of Pandora One with Pandora Plu appear to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentari on that initi will be close watch on the Q4 confer call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announc a new ""Premium"" servic to compet with offer fromSpotify,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenThat product should roll out shortly, potenti boost growth in 2017. And Pandora ha said it is aim to return to Ebitda profit in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investor in P stock should believ the company.A Busi 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actual is up about 65% over the past year, after come close to all-tim low in earli 2016. Those gain have come despit mix perform in the business. Revenu is up 14% through the first nine months, and like rose a similar figur in Q4. But about half the year-to-d growth came from the acquisit of TicketFli last October. Advertis revenu also increas 14% through the first three quarter - but came sole from higher pricing. Activ user were actual down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscript revenu declin in the quarter as well.Th user and subscript figur are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simpli doesn't trust that Pandora can creat consist profit base on advertis revenu alone. That' particularli true given thehigh royalti ratesthat took effect at the begin of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrad One to Plu - ad featur like song replay - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-bas model.Th plan from Pandora, as detail after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provid a more stabl revenu base. Move custom to subscription-bas servic both help margin and improv retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock like will rise. But that remain a rel big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earn report, then, the most import number like will come from the company' guidance. That guidanc will give some color as to how success manag think Plu ha been so far - and what kind of opportun Premium ha to boost Pandora earn thi year.But the Pandora earn confer call also seem like it might move P stock. Manag will have anoth opportun to detail it strategi for 2017 and beyond. The compani laid out it ""three-leg stool"" strategi - Plus, Premium and Ticketfli - after the third quarter, but investor weren't terribl impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsTh issu with P stock is that there' a real fear that Pandora' model simpli doesn't quit work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenc by the nearli 80 million activ users. But it' not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalti rate through ad revenu alone. The compani did announc layoff ofabout 7%of it employe in a bid to improv 2017 profits. That simpli rais addit concern about Pandora stock. The most notabl is: Can Pandora realli compet with Apple, Spotifi andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?Aft all, those compani have much larger busi - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the compani ha burn about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarter of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is like to be huge as well, and that' not count depreci or the addit $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Mak Free Profit From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreci in the near term, the compani need to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidanc given in the Pandora earn report will be key. But that aside, investor also will be look for more inform on the plan go forward here.Can Pandora find a nich in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offer from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there realli a profit busi model here, or are royalti rate simpli too difficult to manage?Thos question can't be answer quit yet, but investor will be look at the Pandora earn report close to better assess the company' prospects. And it' like the commentari on the futur - not the past - that will determin how Pandora stock react to Q4 earnings.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

5 Stocks for 17% Returns This Year (VLO, VCS, CAH, PRU, JNS);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA few week ago we discussedhow you can make 12% annually, forever, from stocks.makeArticleAd();Now let' appli those lesson to 2017, and highlight five that should do even better (17%+ returns) thi year (and like beyond).Remember, project our return from ani given stock is simple. We simpli add togeth the three way it can pay us:It current dividend.A futur dividend hike.Shar repurchases.It also help if the stock is inexpensive, as buyback deliv more bang for management' buck. So let' stick with stock that are dirt-cheap, trade for 10-time free cash flow (FCF) or less for thi exercise.Here' an exampl of a stock readi to return 17% or more over the next year.Blu chip refinerValero Energi Corporation(VLO) ha a great manag team that know how to make money no matter what happen with energi prices.Ov the last five year the compani ha increas it free cash flow (FCF) by 115% per share while reward investor with a cumul 300% dividend raise,even as oil price were chop in half:A Free Cash Flow MachineShar yield 3.6% today - that' money in our pocket. Plu manag recent rais it dividend byanother16.7%. And dividend hike have everyth to do with futur returns.Here' why: Earli next year, Valero will tee up anoth payout increase. It will probabl be a 10 cent per share rais (in line with the last three hikes).Th compani hasplentyof cash to do thi already. It gener $10.40 in FCF over the past twelv months, and will onli pay out $2.80 in dividend over the next twelve!A ""one dime"" hike would be 14%. And if Valero' share stand still, they'll yield more than 4% thi time next year.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenBut here' the thing - they probabl won't pay 4% then becaus investor will bid Valero' price up (and it yield down) in anticip of the hike. After all, even 3% is gener today.Which mean that Valero' share price should climb in line with it next hike. And that' exactli what wa unfoldinguntillate-2015, when the stock ""decoupled"" from it dividend' trajectory:Valero' Stock Due To ""Catch Up""Thi mean Valero' share price actual ha two past dividend hike to ""catch up"" with as well. The stock easili ha 30% to 40% upsid thank to past, present and futur payout hike alone.And let' not forget share repurchases! The firm bought back 15.5% of it outstand float over the last three years, and should continu to be a buyer of it own bargain stock.Buybacks, by the way, are underr as a driver of returns. When the number of share is reduced, everi ""per share"" metric - dividend per share, earnings, and FCF - all improve. And their increas are leverag to the amount of stock that is bought back.Aft all, if profit are flat while float is reduc by 50%, the result is a 100% increas in earn per share! And repurchas also support dividend growth. In Valero' case, it ha fewer and fewer share to ""settl up with"" everi year, so it can hike it payout more than it would otherwis with a static share count.Four More Stock With Boom Sharehold ReturnsIt sound easi to bank double-digit return like these, but here' the catch - in today' expens stock market, Valero doesn't have much compani in the bargain bin.In fact, I count just 19 firm today that:Pay a meaning current yield (2%+).Are grow their dividend 10%+ annually.Hav reduc their outstand share count over the past 12 months.And are dirt-cheap (at less than 10-time FCF).Some of these dividend grower are dog though, as their busi model are be eaten alive. But a few gem are set to endure.Here' a four-pack worthi of addit consideration.Stock for 17% Return Thi Year: CV Health Corp (CVS)CV Health Corp(CVS) run the country' largest drugstor chain, a pharmacy-benefit-manag busi and 1,100 in-stor medic clinics. E-commerc websit such asAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) may be eat into tradit retail sales, but they'r not a threat when it come to prescript drug fulfillment.Th stock' yield ha ""rallied"" to it highest level sinc in the past decade:CV Health' Highest Yield in 10 YearsA 2.3% payout sound modest until we add in like 15%+ dividend growth later thi year (CV ha hike it dividend by 208% over the last five years). Plu a few percentag point worth of buybacks, and we'v got a prescript for 20% returns.Stock for 17% Return Thi Year: Cardin Health Inc (CAH)Cardin Health Inc(CAH) investor are also due for a big 2017. They enter the year hold share trade for just 9.2-time free cash flow (FCF). They'll probabl receiv a double-digit dividend increas in the first half of the year. And their stock price hasn't even caught up to last year' hike yet!CAH Stock Price (Blue) Lag It Payout (Orange)Stock for 17% Return Thi Year: Prudenti Financi Inc (PRU)Lif insurerPrudenti Financi Inc(PRU)trad for just 2.5-time FCF and an equal laughabl 81% of book valu (or what it would be worth if it were broken up and sold off today). That' despit the fact that, as a life insurer, it' well posit to profit from the three rate hike the Fed' plan thi year; PRU invest it ""float""-or the premium it take in-in low-risk, interest-bear securities.Th stock pay 2.6% today, and PRU ha plenti of room to keep rais it dividend with a modest 26% payout ratio.Sinc we first discuss thi bargain last May, share have ralli 35%. They'r still comic cheap.Fin Bill Gross' new home hasn't been hospit to sharehold after the stock' initi ""Bond King pop.""Janu Capit Group Inc(JNS) sit 14% lower today than it did when the legendari bond strategist join the firm.But Janu ha increas it dividend by 38% dure Gross' reign, and it' due for anoth hike. Share pay 3.6% today, their highest mark ever.A I'v said before, while buy stock at all-tim high can be scary, buyingyieldsat all-tim high is often a simpl yet effect market time strategy. Gross & Co. agre - they'v repurchas 1.8% of the firm' outstand share over the last 12 months.Th Sweet Spot: 7% YieldsWithDividend GrowthBlu chip stock like Cardin Health and CV rare pay current yield more than 3% or 4%. They are simpli too popular and likewis usual too expensive.You'l do even better focus on stealth incom play such as closed-end funds, prefer share and real estat invest trust (REITs). In mani cases, these issu pay secur yield of 7% or better - with dividend growth to boot!Thi mean you are assur yourself of 10%+ annual returns, with most of that come as cash dividends. These vehicl are safe, but they aren't as well known as your averag blue chip. And that' agoodth for us, becaus we can lock up secur incom stream of 7% or more while enjoy payout growth and price upsid to boot.Thes stealth play are the perfect invest for 2017. Regardless of Trump' next tweet, these 7% payer are go to becom increasingli popular with retire as they'r discovered. Make sure you buy them now, befor their price get bid up (and their yield are compressed).Click here for the detail about my favorit 7% play in funds, prefer and REIT - and I'll share the names, ticker and buy price with you, too.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryTh post5 Stock for 17% Return Thi Year (VLO, VCS, CAH, PRU, JNS)appear first onInvestorPlace."
Why Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian Opportunity;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) stock provid a play for contrarian head into it fourth-quart earn report. Earn and sale have declin year-over-year in each of the lastsixquarters, which should keep expect low. Meanwhile, Wall Street analyst appear to be exit KO stock en masse.makeArticleAd();Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Morgan Stanley cut Coca-Cola stock to 'Equal Weight' in December; Goldman Sach downgrad KO to 'Sell' last month and Well Fargofollow with it own re-rat to Neutral bare a week later. For investor who like to buy at the point of maximum pessimism, the Coca-Cola earn report look like an opportunity.Of course, KO stock isn't like to make a huge gain off of the Coca-Cola earn report; the stock gener doesn't move all that much. In fact, the rel quiet movement in Coca-Cola stock actual ha been one reason analyst have turn bearish. Those analyst argu that in a more optimist market, with broad index at all-tim highs, KO stock' ""defensive"" natur seem less attractive. Thus, investor are ""rotating"" away from safe, solid name like Coca-Cola andProct & Gambl Co(NYSE:PG) into higher-risk, higher-reward issues.Perhap thi is true, but that argument onli work as long as broad market remain at or near their highs. And for Q4, that pessim seem to leav KO stock well-posit for gain come out of it report.When expect are low, after all, it' difficult to disappoint. But the Q4 report also ha long-term implications. It will be the first earn releas after the appoint of new CEO Jame Quincey. Quincey isn't new to Coca-Cola; he ha work at the compani for twenti years. And outgo CEO Muhtar Kent doesn't leav until May.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryBut the Q4 earn call might give Quincey a chanc to detail the company' plan to deal with consum shift away from soda. Those plan may be of more interest to investor in KO stock than the Q4 numbers.Th KO Stock NumbersAnalyst consensu project KO stock will gener fourth-quart earn of $0.38, down a penni year-over-year. Revenu is expect to declin sharply, fall 8.7% year-over-year.Thos estim aren't quit as bad as they sound, however. The strong dollar is affect revenue: it reduc Q3 revenu by 2%, for instance. Coca-Cola also ha refranchis bottl operations, which ha affect revenue. In the third quarter, for instance, report revenu wa down 7%. But the company' figur of 'organic' revenu - growth exclud divest oper and currenc effect - rose 3%.KO is still target over $600 million in product save thi year. And KO also ha brought in nearli three-quart of a billion dollar in proce from the refranchis proceeds. The cost save and cash inflow are be use in part to fund new marketing, but also are improv margins.And if Coca-Cola earn show further margin improvements, and a surpris earn beat that show some bottom-lin growth, the narr here could change. With analyst price in a declin business, ani sort of growth in Q4 could provid a nice boost to KO stock.Th Coca-Cola Earn Release: The StoryNumb aside, investor no doubt are more interest in the company' long-term strategy. It' highli unlik that Coca-Cola will disclos some massiv chang in it operations, to be sure. The current focu on cost control, and the refranchis efforts, seem like to persist.But KO doe have some option in term of strategy. Unlik it chief rivalPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP), which own Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola notabl no longer ha a food business. Coke reportedli consid make an offer for yogurt manufactur Chobani, and a move to diversifi away from beverag could provid a more stabl revenu base. The compani also own nearli 17% ofMonst Beverag Corporation(NASDAQ:MNST), and could decid to make a play for the rest of that company.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAnd the mega-merg still sit on the horizon. Mani analyst are convinc thatAnheus Busch Inbev NV (ADR)(NYSE:BUD) will eventu make a play for KO stock. The departur of Warren Buffett' son Howard from the KO board ha either fuel or dampen that speculation, depend on the analyst. Howard Buffett' exit could meanBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) is look to sell it stake in KO stock. Or it could mean that Warren Buffett and Berkshir are interest in be part of a takeov - and don't want to face the conflict impli by have a seat on Coca-Cola' board.So while there' reason to see some contrarian optim toward the report from a fundament standpoint, the real stori out of the KO earn report will be the stori manag tell to investors. With a strong balanc sheet, a new CEO and a number of M&A options, Coca-Cola ha a lot of path to take. Investor will be listen close to see if KO manag give ani hint as to it direction.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America Great7 Dividend Growth Stock on Sale TodayTh postWhi Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian Opportunityappear first onInvestorPlace."

Moreover, recent launch product like Bot Manag and Imag Manag will take some time to fulli penetr the market. Hence, we don't expect revenu growth to acceler at least in the near term.Further, faster increas in capit expenditur and increas headcount invest will keep margin under pressur in full year 2017.Despit the headwinds, we believ that the compani ha signific growth prospect in 2017.

Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Amazon.com, Inc.;2/7/2017;"They are two of the strongest compani in the world. Befor you go to bed each night, you'v like spent time use bothMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) suit of technolog products, and bought, received, or stream content viaAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .An invest of $1,000 in Microsoft or Amazon back in 1997 would now be worth $8,000 or $540,000, respectively! While there' a big gap between the two, both are impress returns.But which is the better buy today? To be honest, you can't go wrong buy either one of these companies. If forc to choose, however, here are three differ lens through which you can evalu the question and decid for yourself.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti ImagesSustain competit advantagesIf you'r go to choos to forgo the safe rout of buy index fund and tri your hand at invest in individu stocks, there' no variabl you should spend more time focus on than a company' sustain competit advantage. Often call a ""moat"" in invest circles, a company' sustain competit advantag are what keep custom come back, year after year and decad after decade.For Microsoft, the moat is pretti easi to define. The compani own some of the most wide use applic in the world, includ the Microsoft Offic Suit and Windows. While the compani also ha hardwar product avail and it Azur cloud compet servic is grow rapidly, the moat provid by these offer are much narrower.Amazon, on the other hand, ha a host of moats. First, the company' impress network of fulfil center allow it to deliv packag quicker than anyon else. And it would costbillionsin upfront invest for ani compani to come close to touch this. Second, the company' membership roll in Amazon Prime -- while not publicli disclos -- are like over fifti million.But perhap most importantly, the compani ha begun to benefit from the network effect: as Prime membership grows, the number of third-parti vendor use Amazon' fulfil servic is swelling. With each new Prime member, a vendor is incentiv to use Amazon' platform. And with each new vendor, a potenti custom is incentiv to shop on Amazon. That creat averypow moat.Whil I hardli think Microsoft is in trouble, I'm give the edg here to Amazon.Winn = AmazonFinanci FortitudeIt' great to see money return to you everi quarter in the form of dividends. It' even better to see cash be reinvest for excit growth opportun in the future. But at the end of the day, there' no substitut for bore old cash sit in the bank.That' becaus everi company, at some time, will face econom difficulties. Those that face such time with cash in the bank have options: they can outspend rival into oblivion, buy back share on the cheap, or even make acquisitions.Debt-heavi compani are in the opposit boat, forc to narrow their focu just to meet the demand of their creditors.Here' how Amazon and Microsoft stack up in term of financi fortitude.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFre Cash FlowMicrosoft$132 billion$59 billion$16.8 billion$27.5 billionAmazon$26 billion$8 billion$2.4 billion$9.7 billionData source: Yahoo! FinanceA I said at the outset, these are two of the strongest compani in the world. That is reflect in their balanc sheets. If I were forc to choos a winner here, however, Microsoft would take the crown. The compani creat massiv free cash flow from it core Window and Offic platforms, and it is one of onli two compani left that have AAA credit rate from Standard & Poor's.Amazon' no slouch either. But CEO/Found Jeff Bezo is (in)fam for play the uber-long game -- reinvest revenu into the busi to further build an impenetr moat around the company.Winn = Microsoft.ValuationFinally, we have valuation.

Thi ha almost alway been the case. And investor that have pass on Amazon becaus of it have paid the price in miss return the whole time.That be said, it' hard not to give the valuat edg to Microsoft. The compani trade for a reason valuation, and it offer a solid and sustain dividend.Winn = MicrosoftAnd the winner is...MicrosoftSo there you have it: While Amazon ha a more impress moat, Microsoft ha both a better balanc sheet and a more reason valuation. That be said, it would be disingenu of me not to mention that Amazon is by far my largest person holding, account for a whop 19% of my family' real-lif holdings.That' not necessarili becaus we'v invest a lot in the stock. Rather, it' becaus share have appreci by so much sinc we first bought share back in 2010.

Tech Stock Roundup: Industry Comments on Visa Ban;2/7/2017;"The technolog sector ha grown increasingli depend on foreign talent over the year such that today it can't function without it. On the face of things, thi ha been realli good for innov help the U.S. maintain it technolog lead over others. But dig down a bit deeper, what thi mean is that the U.S. is increasingli incap of produc thi talent itself. Thi is not a good situat to be in, particularli when you consid that countri like China are do all they can to develop indigen intellectu property.That' probabl the reason Presid Trump' draft propos accord to Bloomberg read as follows: ""Our country' immigr polici should be design and implement to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. nation interest… Visa program for foreign workers... should be administ in a manner that protect the civil right of American worker and current law residents, and that priorit the protect of American worker - our forgotten work peopl - and the job they hold.""Ther are mani conflict view and opinion about H-1B visa that compani use to employ peopl from other countri when adequ resourc in the field of science, technology, engin and math aren't avail locally. But sinc foreign labor is usual cheaper, critic say that compani tend to employ foreign even when the skill are avail thu depress wage for the industri as a whole.Ron Hira, an associ professor at Howard University, ha done extens research on the topic. Support say there isn't room to control wage inflat sinc the program is highli regul and technolog compani like AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, in fact, pay handsomely.Whatev the opinion on the wage rate, there' no deni that the job go to foreigners. If the trend continues, high tech American employe will have a harder time find jobs, thu gradual close down the institut produc them. The per capita GDP attribut to such job will also go down as tech employe from abroad obtain American citizenship.It' also true that a countri is in a posit of absorb others, give them a home, a job, etc. when it is itself in a posit of strength. But when it can't find local tech workers, it' definit not in that posit and may need some temporari measur to rejuvenate.There' also anoth side to the story. If tech compani are unsuccess in their letter of appeal, lawsuit and other measur they'r take against the Presid and the propos is enforced, they may decid to employ the same talent in intern facilities. A company' main motiv and object is to gener profit, and there could be initi cost of set up such intern operations.Th visa issu ha been club with anoth import one involv terror becaus the Presid ha block all refuge from enter the U.S. for 120 day (the ban is indefinit for Syrian refuge possibl becaus of their act of vandal across Europe). Citizen of seven predominantli Muslim countri like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen were also ban from enter the U.S. for 90 days. Thi seem like a rel short period of time and what will be achiev in the interim remain unclear.In the meantime, Attorney Gener Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, file a complaint say Trump' order is ""undermin the state' sovereign interests"" in violat of equal protect law under the Fifth Amendment. Washington State also su the Presid with support from Amazon and Microsoft.But don't imagin that the so-cal refuge are helpless victim becaus they have plenti of power lobbi work for them. The American Civil Liberti Union (ACLU) and the Council on American-Islam Relat (CAIR) are get readi to file lawsuits. What' more, Googl ha creat a ""crisi fund"" with $2 million and it employe have contribut a like amount that they are gift the ACLU. Other fund are also on the way.But tech compani have plenti to say about both issues:Apple: CEO Tim Cook told employe that the compani had commun with the White House. ""I'v heard from mani of you who are deepli concern about the execut order issu (Friday) restrict immigr from seven Muslim-major countries. I share your concerns. It is not a polici we support…Appl would not exist without immigration, let alon thrive and innov the way we do,"" he wrote in an email.Google: CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo to employees: ""It' pain to see the person cost of thi execut order on our colleagues…We'v alway made our view on immigr issu known publicli and will continu to do so.""

He also said: ""At Intel we believ that immigr is an import part of our divers and inclus efforts"" and ""Inclus is about make everyon feel welcom and part of our community.""It offici statement says, ""We are provid support to potenti impact employees, all of whom are in thi countri lawfully. As a compani co-found by an immigrant, we continu to support law immigration. We will continu to provid ani impact employe with Intel' full support.""A statement on the compani websit say that it support ""legisl or administr action to improv the immigr system for highli skill employees."" Half it 106K employe work in other countri and it U.S. worker includ roughli 3K foreign on work visa for those with special skills. But the number of employe from the seven ban nation is not known. Intel explain it contribut to Trump' inaugur committe by say that it gave Intel a seat at the tabl on issu import to the company.Microsoft: Microsoft' presid and chief legal offic Brad Smith wrote in a letter to the Secretari of State Rex Tillerson that there are current 76 U.S. visa holder within the tech firm and 41 depend who are citizen of the seven countri mention in the order. ""These are not situat that law-abid individu should be forc to confront when there is no evid that they pose a secur or safeti threat to the Unit States,"" he said.Satya Nadella, Microsoft' CEO, said, ""A an immigr and as a CEO, I'v both experienc and seen the posit impact that immigr ha on our company, for the country, and for the world"" while post Smith' email to employe on LinkedIn. Microsoft is tri everyth to keep it option open. On the one hand it is join Washington state to sue Trump while on the other, it is request the govern to make an except for ""respons known travel with press needs"" so peopl with passport from one of the countri list in the order can return to the U.S. as long as they have a valid work or student visa and have not commit a crime in the U.S.Micorsoft is also ask that employe and student affect by the ban be allow to travel outsid of the U.S. for busi reasons, except to the seven countri on the list. It is also ask that peopl with passport from one of the countri be allow to go home for famili reason on a case-by-cas basis.Tesla: CEO Elon Musk, one of onli a few tech execut on Trump' busi advisori team and manufactur job initiative: ""The blanket entri ban on citizen from certain primarili Muslim countri is not the best way to address the country' challenges,"" he tweet on Saturday. ""Mani peopl neg affect by thi polici are strong support of the US.

Accord to Bloomberg, the Appl chip, which went into develop last year, will gradual take over the function of the Intel processor, pave the way for Apple' processor independence.But chip gener take 3-4 year to get into mass production, so Daryanani' view that it will not impact Intel' busi in 2017 and also possibl in 2018 make sense. He say that if Intel is total design out, it will be a $2-3 billion hit to annual revenue, $750 million to $1 billion hit to oper incom with a 12-16 cent impact on the annual EPS.Intel Go: Intel is boost it automot effort by creat a new divis call Intel Go to solv hardwar problem like comput vision, infotainment, 5G wireless connect and AI technology.

Single-us or infrequently-us app sometim have to be download becaus the mobil web browser of compani aren't that great. Sinc unnecessari download are noth but wast memori and space, Googl will stream part of the app from it own servers, so neither the download nor the mobil web is required. The compani is now roll out the servic to select users.Slack' Answer to Microsoft: The Slack Enterpris Grid design for larger and more complex busi offer ident manag technology, data loss prevent and advanc secur systems. The Slack solut is also compliant with regulatori requir in healthcar and financ sectors, which may be partli respons for it swell user base.Th compani said that it now ha 1.5 million pay users, which is commend sinc it doesn't offer mani other comput build block that rival Microsoft does. In Nov 2016, Microsoft announc Teams, which connect the chat featur with the Offic 365 cloud suite, therebi facilit collaboration. The two are now compet head-on.M&A and CollaborationsCisco Buy AppDynamics: Cisco paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics, an applic perform manag compani just befor it wa schedul to float it IPO.

Cisco ha been tri to build the softwar and servic side of the business, with particular focu on the emerg Internet of Things. The acquisit will sure provid the ""end to end visibl and intellig from the network through the application"" that it is look for and could nudg up softwar revenu from the current 29%, but the price tag look high.Alibaba Affili Buy MoneyGram: Alibaba' payment arm Ant Financi is buy Nasdaq-list MoneyGram for $880 million.

Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock May Get Snapped After Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsInvestor have been get bullish withTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR), as the stock ha climb about 13% so far on the year. As usual, there have been the variou buyout rumors, which have probabl account for quit a bit of the gain.makeArticleAd();Source:Andrea Eldh via FlickrYet might all thi be anoth exampl of over eager with Twitter stock? Perhap there will just be more disappoint when the compani report it earn on Thursday?Well, the good news is that the bar is not set too high. The Street is expect for Twitter earn to come to 12 cent a share (on an adjust basis) and revenu to hit $740.1 million.Bi comparison,last yearth compani report profit of 16 cent a share and a top-lin of $710 million.In other words, the consensu is for the revenu to grow by a mere 4.2%, which would repres the slowest ramp sinc TWTR becam a public company. To put thi into perspective,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)generateda massiv $8.6 billion in revenu in Q4, up a sizzl 53%. So is it ani wonder that Twitter stock ha been mostli a bad investment?7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialOf cours not.Now, in term of the quarter, TWTR stock could benefit from some catalysts. Some of those includ the impact of the holiday season as well as the wild presidenti elect and the live-stream of NFL games.But such thing will like be temporari for Twitter stock. The fact is that the lacklust user growth will probabl continu to weigh on the company. For example, Cantor' Youssef Squali isforecastingonli a 2 million net monthli activ user increas in the base to 319 million, up 4.6%. Thi would be roughli the same as Q3' growth rate.But none of thi should be a surprise. TWTR ha been beset with frequent turnov in the execut ranks. It also doe not help that the CEO, Jack Dorsey, spend time as the head ofSquar Inc(NYSE:SQ).Hey, do Zuckerberg orSnap'sEvan Spiegel side gigs? No, becaus they realiz that the onlin world is brutal competitive.Bottom Line on Twitter StockActually, the Snap IPO may put even more pressur on Twitter stock. Investor will soon have anoth high-growth play to put their money into. As a result, TWTR stock will becom more marginalized.Now. Dorsey ha talk about improv the servic and make it easier to use. But so far, the action have fallen flat. Granted, at the start of the New Year, he ask user for feedback. Yet much of it wa kind of vague. Instead, user would rather spend their time on platform like FB, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. It' that simple. For the most part, TWTR ha fail to keep up with the latest trends, such as with chat and video.Unfortunately, when a consum tech compani get into thi situation, it is tough to turn thing around. Just look at classic exampl likeYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) andAOL. They spent year tri to find way to juic up user number - but noth seem to work.Part of thi is that the brand quickli lose it luster. But there is someth else: resourc start to dwindl as cash flow drop.In fact, both seem to be issu with Twitter stock. If anything, the brand appear kind of crusti and is also associ with harass and bullying. Oh, and in term of the core operations, the compani ha been reduc the workforc and unload variou segments, such as the recent sale ofFabrictoAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Th like end-gam for TWTR stock, of course, is a sale of the company. But of course, the problem there is that when the compani put itself up on the block last year, there wa littl interest.Thi doe not mean thing are absolut hopeless.

It mark just the latest step in Amazon' appar long-term ambit to creat some type of global logist and deliveri platform.Recal that earli last year, Amazon sign adeal to lease20Boeing767 as part of it partnership withAir Transport Servic Group, an agreement that also saw Amazon make a minor invest in the compani as well.

Is Advertising Amazon's Next Big Growth Product?;2/7/2017;"In digit advertis there areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there' everyon else. But one compani is start to emerg as a potenti contend to the two ad behemoths:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is start to spread it wing as an advertiser.Amazon certainli ha the user data to compet with Facebook or the bigAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it ha onli 300 million activ custom as of it last update, the shop data it ha on those user is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be abl to target advertis better than Facebook or Googl despit their huge trove of user data. After all, noth speak louder than how peopl spend their money.Imag source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();What' thi other revenu line item, and why' it grow so quickly?Dur Amazon' fourth-quart earn call, UB analyst Eric Sheridan ask about the ""other"" line item on Amazon' incom statement. He point out that it' exhibit a lot of momentum over the past few year and wonder if that wa due to growth in advertising.Th other categori includ ""certain advertis servic and our co-brand credit card agreements,"" accord to Amazon' quarterli report. While Amazon did just revamp it credit card offering, it' been around in some form in the U.S. sinc 2002 and in Canada sinc 2012. The vast major of growth in the categori is probabl come from advertising.And it' been growing. Last year, other revenu in North America increas 60%. That acceler to 81% growth in the fourth quarter. That make it Amazon' fastest grow sourc of revenue, grow even faster than it cloud-comput service, Amazon Web Services.Granted, the other revenu Amazon bring in account for just 1.7% of it total North American sale -- $1.3 billion. So it' still work on a veri small revenu base.Expand it ad productsMost of the ad Amazon sell are on it own websites. Search result on Amazon have an increas number of sponsor products, with which third-parti merchant pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlik Google' search advertising. Manag describ sponsor product as ""off to a great start,"" indic they see a lot of room for expansion.A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of onlin shopper begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more peopl search Amazon for products, the more ad it can show. In fact, sponsor product could start steal ad budget away from Google, which is whyEric Schmidt said it' Google' biggest competitorin 2014.But Amazon' advertis is start to extend beyond it own websites, wade deep into Google' territory. Last year it develop a header-bid solution. Header bid allow publish to take more offer for their ad inventori instead of wade through each offer one by one and take the first decent one they find. (Thi is all done extrem quickli by comput algorithms.)Amazon' advantag in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithm ad bid process in it AW servers, enabl publishers' websit to load faster than other header-bid system allow. Googl ha histor domin the space that header bid threatens.A mentioned, Amazon is one of the few compani with user data that can compet with the target capabl of Facebook or Google. So if it continu to build out it advertis product on third-parti websites, it could start to take a signific share of revenu from Googl and Facebook. Googl gener $15.6 billion in revenu from it network members' websit last year. Facebook' Audienc Network reach a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the compani hasn't provid ani updat sinc then.Th digit ad market is huge. Advertis spent $195 billion worldwid on onlin ad last year, accord to eMarketer. That number is expect to grow to $335 billion by 2020.

That' a big ""if"" becaus if the technolog doesn't work the company' profit will walk out the door - literally.Even if Amazon Go can elimin the need for cashiers, it may make more sens for the compani to licens the technolog rather than open physic stores.Furthermore, the incumb groceri chain haven't been the pushov that some pundit had expected.

3 Signs Netflix Inc.'s Best Days Are Ahead;2/6/2017;"Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) just close the book on a record fiscal year that ad 19 million stream member to it rolls. Yet with growth slow in it core U.S. market, and with no new geographi left to conquer (except for China), some investor are concern that there' littl room to add to it near 100 million subscrib -- and $61 billion market capitalization.Below, I'll highlight a few of the biggest factor that suggest those worri are overblown.Pr powerNetflix' fourth-quart subscrib growth figuresblew away expectationsa 7 million peopl sign up for it servic compar to the 5 million that CEO Reed Hast and hi team had forecast. That outperform allow the compani to post anoth year of acceler global gains: Net addit were 19 million in 2016, up from 17.3 million in the prior year.makeArticleAd();Annu subscrib gains. Chart by author.Th raw growth stori would be impress enough on it own, but Netflix also demonstr strong price power in thi report. A big chunk of the U.S. member base wa push onto higher-pr plan last quarter, which prompt user with a good reason to cancel. Instead, not onli did most member stick around, but there' evid that mani custom who recent bolt over the price increas decid to come back.In other words, TV fan are find that Netflix' valu proposit is compelling, even at the higher price point that ha push averag monthli spend up 15% and allow profit to jump to almost 40% of sale in the core U.S. market.Intern growthIn earli 2016, the compani sped up it global expans plan by simultan launch in nearli all the market it want to enter. There' noth approach that type of event in the future, and so intern subscrib growth is like to trend lower over the short term. Next quarter, for example, Netflix is forecast 3.7 million new users, compar to 4.5 million addit in the prior-year period.Imag source: Netflix.Th global growth stori stretch out far longer than just a singl year, though. Almost 20 quarter after launch in Latin America, Netflix is final get up to speed in that market, and there' everi reason to expect a compar learn curv in other area as it tweak the servic and build brand strength.Th compani see a huge long-term opportun in Japan, too, but the biggest payoff there will come onc the compani is more establish and ha compil a deep enough portfolio of local content. It won't be as dramat asgo live in 130 countri at once, but Netflix ha a huge runway for intern growth ahead.Scal advantagesHast and hi team have been priorit subscrib growth over earn for the last sever years. The think behind that strategi wa that Netflix first need to establish global scale to block out rivals. Onli then would it use it domin posit to extract meaning profit for investors.We'r final enter the second part of that master plan -- and investor must be pleased. Netflix is find that origin show and movi travel well across borders, which is give it a key advantag in the bid war for content against stream studio that have to piec togeth right on a region-by-region basis. The effici are a key reason whi it plan to scale back on market spend while doubl oper profit thi year.Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is no longer in that region category, have recent match Netflix in global availability. But few other stream specialist can hope to even approach the$8 billion in spending($6 billion on content alone) that Netflix will shell out on it servic thi year. And at some point, the onlin retail titan might even balk at the expens of keep pace with the stream specialist.A full decad ha pass sinc Netflix tipto into stream video in what Hast predict would be the company' second act after domin DVD rental.

Prime is one of the three pillar of Amazon, and it membership drive astound loyalty. Wal-Mart wa look for a similar effect with ShippingPass. Instead, it' move down market, reduc the threshold for free ship to $35 from $49, and promis to get some 2 million item to custom in just a coupl days.Wal-Mart can't competeBoth Amazon and Wal-Mart boast huge marketplac that bring togeth thousand of merchant on their onlin platforms. But where Wal-Mart fall short is that it' heavili reliant on it third-parti merchant to fulfil onlin order themselves. In fact, just 2 million item qualifi for two-day shipping.Bi comparison, Amazon' marketplac ha over 50 million Prime-elig items. That' thank to it Fulfil by Amazon servic where merchant send inventori to Amazon' warehouses, and Amazon handl ship individu item to customers.In other words, Wal-Mart' two-day ship servic wa half-bak compar to Amazon's. Custom who sign up for the free trial were like disappoint at the lack of product selection, and didn't pay up for the service.Wal-Mart won't tear custom away from PrimeBi offer free two-day ship to everyone, Wal-Mart isn't tri to get Prime member to ditch Amazon (at least it shouldn't be). Instead, it strategi seem to be to prevent custom from ever sign up for it in the first place. Prime member are extrem loyal and have an extrem lowchurn rate, so that' about the best Wal-Mart can hope for.It' a bit late to the game, however, consid Amazon ha alreadi sign up around half of the household in the U.S. In the last year alone, Amazon ad ""ten of millions"" of new members.If Wal-Mart stand ani chanc of compet with Amazon, it need toleverag it physic stores. That' exactli what it new ship program does. Item qualifi for two-day ship are usual avail in local store already, mean Wal-Mart onli need to ship it the last mile to a shopper home.Whil free two-day ship for everyon may win Wal-Mart a few one-off purchases, it won't cut into the loyal and grow Amazon Prime custom base. The best it can hope for is to establish it onlin portal as top of mind for onlin shoppers. That' one of the biggest hurdl for Wal-Mart or ani onlin retail to overcome.Amazon current domin mindshare. Fifty-f percent of onlin product search start on it website, accord to a survey from BloomReach last Fall. If Wal-Mart' new ship polici can help it grab some of those product searches, it ought to be consid a win even if it attempt to take on Amazon Prime failed.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here’s How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsShar ofAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) still appear undervalu despit the compani alreadi significantli outperform the market. If you bought stock in Alibaba sinc the end of December, you'r up almost 20%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, for reason I will outline, Alibaba stock - thank to emerg in the cloud and the momentum in it core e-commerc busi - can still deliv 25% return in the next 12 to 18 months.Assess the Valu in Alibaba StockAlibaba share have risen some 15% year to date, compar with about 2% rise in theS&P 500 Index. Base on fiscal 2018 earn estim of $4.30 per share, Alibaba stock is current price at a forward price-earn ratio of roughli 23, which is about in line with the averag stock in the S&P 500.And here' the thing: Assum the compani doe earn $4.30 per share, that would translat to year-over-year earn growth of 23%. From my vantag point, Alibaba stock remain one of the better bargain on the market even with it recent rally.In other words, investor still have an opportun to buy not onli into a great growth story, but also diversifi their invest by bet on the growth of China' middl class. But Alibaba is more than just a bet on China' recov economy. The company, which saw a 54% jump inthird-quart revenue, lead to an impress 17-cent beat on the bottom line, crush Wall Street' fiscal estim on almost everi metric.3 Big Buyout Deal That Could Crush InvestorsOften compar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) becaus of their e-commerc similarities, Alibaba founder/execut chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang prove they can do what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo ha shown a knack for: Mash the profit-margin acceler whenev he feel like it and when the market least expect it. And as with Amazon, Alibaba' cloud platform Alicloud (which post a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue) ha becom a force.Not onli is Alibaba enjoy an increas in the number of pay customers, the custom are also spend higher than usual. All told, the company' strong revenu growth, driven by it diversifi technolog and data strategi continu to pay off. And with the compani boost it 2017 fiscal year revenu growth guidanc from 48% to 53%, Alibaba is show no sign of slow down.Bottom Line for Alibaba StockWith cloud revenu begin to take a bigger portion of the business, combin with the strength in it core e-commerc operation, BABA ha ton of room to run.Here' How Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200A such, while I'm not will to suggest BABA deserv the same respect as Amazon, which is price at a forward P/E of 63, Alibaba should command a P/E of 30, which put Alibaba stock at around $130, deliv almost 25% to 30% in the next year-and-a-half or so.A of thi writing, Richard Saintvilu did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialTh postHere' How Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%appear first onInvestorPlace."

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Charles Schwab, Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund, Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund and Schwab U.S. TIPS;2/6/2017;"For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - Februari 06, 2017 - Today, Zack Invest Idea featur highlight Features:Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report),Charl Schwab(NYSE:SCHW-Fre Report),Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund(MUTF:SWPPX-Fre Report),Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund(MUTF:SWSSX-Fre Report) andSchwab U.S. TIP ETF(NYSEARCA:SCHP-Fre Report).How Charl Schwab Is Becom the Amazon of InvestingAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report) ha becom a behemoth in the retail world.Sure, the company' most recent earn report may have left a bit to be desired, but there is no deni how far Amazon ha come in a few short years. The compani easili domin the consum world, and it ha left a varieti of big-box retail in it wake in the process.Whil we can point to a number of reason for Amazon' ascent, a key to their rise is clearli Amazon Prime. Thi subscript service-which cost $99/year-giv user free two day shipping, video content, music, and a number of other featur as well. The deal is so good that some estimateclos to half of the country' household have a Prime account, with plenti of new subscrib now be ad in foreign nation too.What is the point of this? Well, Prime member (at least in the U.S.)spend roughli twice as mucha non-Prim user on Amazon, while the servic ha an insan renew rate in the Unit States,ov 90% accordingto the Consum Intellig Research Partners, so peopl are clearli see the value.But with so mani servic and offer in the Prime package, how doe Amazon make ani money? Well, the idea is clearli to suck peopl in to the Amazon ecosystem via Prime, and then keep them there for years. And with such a high renew rate and spend that is doubl non-Prim users, it is clearli pay off. One onli need to look at the demis of other retail in a number of area to understand just how much Amazon is domin the consum world these days.So, the strategi is to give peopl an offer that is too good to refus in order to get them in the door and look at higher margin product later on. AsJeff Bezo said, Prime is 'such a good value, you'd be irrespons not to be a member'.Th Amazon of Investing?W can see how Amazon ha chang the world of retail and the consum market, but is anyon do the same thing for investing?I'd argu that Charl Schwab (NYSE:SCHW-Fre Report) is adopt thi 'Amazon model' in the world of investing, and thi is especi evid after their recent move.Their latest announcementbrought fee down to $6.95/trade from their previou spot at $8.95/trade, while Schwab also announc a fee cut on some of it broad market mutual funds, and that mutual fund cost would match their ETF counterpart too.Th compani will now charg 0.03% for it Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (MUTF:SWPPX-Fre Report), while the Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund (MUTF:SWSSX-Fre Report) will cost 0.06% per year. Additionally, the compani also reduc fee for it Schwab U.S. Aggreg Bond Index Fund down to 0.04% (which come out later in February) to becom an ultra-cheap choic in that market too. They also discuss the idea of reduc fee for the Schwab U.S. TIP ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHP-Fre Report) and their fundament index ETFs, but those chang will take place on March first.Thes cut put Schwab' fee down to level below it major competitors, Fidelity, E*Trad andTD Ameritrade, and it sent shockwav throughout the industry. Share price of ETFC and AMTD were down nearli 10% immedi follow the announcement, while SCHW took a hit as well.I understand whi the group wa hit in the market follow the press release, as it definit kick off worri over a price war. And as for Charl Schwab, charg such rock bottom level all but guarante that Charl Schwab will lose money on it fund business, and it will probabl see less revenu from it commiss in the process too.So Whi Is Thi Like Amazon?To me, thi is veri reminisc of the Amazon Prime service. You give peopl a ton of low cost option that are bound to pleas a wide rang of people. So, instead of two day ship and free video content, if you are in the invest world, you offer up fee that are less than major peer and nearly-fre ETF and mutual funds.Th move get plenti of peopl in the door, and it keep them insid the ecosystem. Onc you switch to Schwab for the low fee and start put money in their ETF and mutual funds, it becom difficult to justifi switch back. Thi is exactli like how you get use to the two-day shipping, music, Pantry, and other featur from Amazon, keep you stuck in the system. Charl Schwab, much like Amazon, realiz that win over new custom is a vital part of thi business, and that provid them low cost product is essenti to keep custom happi and away from the competit over the long-term.And onc you have enough custom that you suck in through the low price options, you now have the abil to earn money off them in differ ways. Amazon doe thi with a varieti of their media product and retail option in gener (such as Pantry), though there are obvious some key differ between the retail and invest worlds.Schwab can do someth similar to Amazon' approach nonetheless though. Bring peopl in for low cost index product and cheap trades, and then make the real profit off high margin activ that Amazon can onli dream of. These include, invest management, servic fees, and most importantly, invest the float.Thi last item will prove to be key for Schwab and other brokers, and especi if rate rise as most are expecting. For 2016, interest incom account for roughli 44% of Schwab' net revenues, and that wa in a year with mostli low-rates. Consid that trade revenu make up about 11% of the total revenu (look at 2016), and it is pretti reason to think that Schwab will be alright in the long term with a modest fee cut.I think that Schwab see the same thing with the write on the wall for a low rate environment. They are will to sacrific a bit in trade revenu now in order to get new user on the platform and get access to their potenti asset base and the invest float that come along with it. And if rate rise as most are expecting, thi could prove to pay off, and especi consid that interest make up a plural of revenu already, and that is with rate at ultra-low levels.So, while Schwab might be down on thi news now, it is a brilliant strategi in order to get more client and capit in the door over the long haul. It is thi type of forward think that ha propel Amazon to great in the consum market, and it is about time someon tri thi in the invest world as well.Want key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>FollowBrian Bolanon Twitter@BBolan1W more articl from thi author?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Still Relies on Office and Windows;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTher is a newfound sens of optim towardMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), and MSFT stock. Microsoft stock touch an all-tim high over $65 last week after the company' fiscal second-quart earn report. Yet, earn haven't realli budg the last five years, as lower PC sale have pressur Microsoft revenu from it legaci Window and Offic products.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart Via FlickrOf late, however, Microsoft ha shown growth in newer products. The Surfac product line and cloud computing, led by the Azur platform, are post impress growth rates. And, Surfac and Azur are drive much of the optim that ha led MSFT stock to increas nearli 150% in a littl over four years.But, lost in that optim toward MSFT seem to be the fact that most of Microsoft' busi is rel unchang from what it wa three to four year ago - if not worse. Window is a declin platform. There are multipl competitor tri to take down Office, and the cloud shift is cannib some of Microsoft' SQL Server business.So, while there' a reason to see growth come from Microsoft' new opportunities, investor in Microsoft stock need to rememb that most of the busi isn't nearli as attractive.Azur and Surfac Are Drive Microsoft Stock HigherTher is reason for optim toward Azur and Surface. The Surfac line garner rave reviews, and sale have been strong. Microsoft ha an impress opportun to drive commerci sales, with the compani call out a major contract with the U.K. Custom Servic on it Q2 confer call.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryGrowth in Azur ha been even more impressive. Revenu increas 93% in the second quarter and 104% in the first half of FY17. Microsoft remain well behindAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and it Amazon Web Servic business. But, it ha a clear opportun to get to at least second place in what should be a large, fast-grow end market. That portend year of growth in Azure, a potenti driver for MSFT stock.At the same time, however, Microsoft is a huge company, with trail twelve-month revenu over $85 billion. And, neither Azur nor Surfac repres a signific portion of those overal sales. Microsoft still doesn't break out Azur sales, but estim suggest roughli $3 billion in fiscal 2017 - less than 4% of overal revenue.P the MSFT 10-K, Surfac sale were about $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and those sale actual declin 2% year over year in the second quarter. Some of that weak came from the company' phase out of Surfac 3, and gross margin have improved. But, Azur and Surfac combin are still less than 10% of total revenue. Even ad cloud comput as a whole, the figur bare get to one-quart next year, as MSFT is target a $20 billion run rate for commerci cloud.Simpl math show that it' tough for Microsoft to grow as a whole if onli a small portion of revenu is drive that growth. Indeed, that' been the case thi year. Overal revenu grew just 1.2% in the second quarter, and 0.8% for the first half. Exclud phone sale - where Microsoft ha all but ha exit the busi - top-lin growth wa still under 5% in Q2 and Q1.Yet MSFT stock now is price as a growth stock. That might be aggressive.MSFT Earn Still Reli on Offic and WindowsTh problem for MSFT stock is that so much of Microsoft' busi still come from it better-known products. The More Person Comput segment gener nearli 50% of first half sales. That includ Window revenu - which wa almost 20% of FY16 sale - along with Xbox, Search, and devic (includ Surface).Surfac aside, that' not a particularli attract group. Window revenu seem like to declin over the long term and ha declin in each of the last two fiscal years. Bing ha perform well of late, but in part becaus Microsoft ha spent up to attract traffic. The Product and Busi Process segment is almost one-third of sales. Prior to Microsoft' acquisit ofLinkedIn Corp, it consist primarili of Offic and Dynamics, MSFT' CRM solution.First-half growth ha been impressive, grow about 7%, exclud the contribut from LinkedIn. But, that come after revenu in the segment declin between FY14 and FY16. While Offic 365 sale growth look solid, much of that growth is simpli come from a shift to ""on-premise"" Offic licenses.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockTher are two concern about the long-term growth prospect of Microsoft stock. The first is that some of the recent headlin growth in categori such as cloud and offic is simpli come from exist products. Some Azur sale are come from custom switch away from Microsoft SQL Server. Offic 365 sale aren't go to new custom who didn't have word process software; rather, most subscrib are former user of disk-bas Offic products.A Trade War With China Put These Stock at RiskTh second concern is that so much of the busi is stagnant (though bull might say ""stable"" instead). That make overal growth tough: if 20% of the busi grow 20%, and the rest is flat or declining, overal growth rate stay in the 4% range.With MSFT stock steadili appreci due almost sole to multipl appreciation, rather than earn growth, investor are clearli expect sale to pick up. But, it' import to rememb that Azur and Surfac won't be abl to drive that acceler on their own.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock to Sell as Fear Return to the Market5 Safe Dividend Stock to Buy for RetirementTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Still Reli on Offic and Windowsappear first onInvestorPlace."

Thi support previou report that Facebook wa look to licens origin content, and suggest that it user could deliv live broadcast to TV via Facebook Live.Wil thi move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTub alreadi too far ahead in the video stream wars?Understand Facebook' video effortsYouTub is the biggest video stream site in the world, but Facebook' video ecosystem ha been grow quickly. Last January, Facebook reveal that it user watch 100 million hour of video per day. At the time,Busi Insiderestim that YouTub user were watch about 650 million hour of video everi day.Dur last quarter' confer call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg call video ""a megatrend on the same order as mobile"", and highlight the way that video ecosystem wa expanding.

It also plan to invest more in origin video content to ""seed that ecosystem"" throughout 2017.Facebook' interest in video make sense, sinc video ad cost much more than tradit display ads. As Facebook' activ user growth slow down, video ad can bolster it top line by milk more ad revenu from exist users. Sinc nearli 94% of Facebook' 1.86 billion monthli activ user alreadi access the site from mobil devices, it also need to look toward other platform -- like set top box -- to continu grow it ad ecosystem.Carv out a nich between Netflix and AmazonAt first glance, it seem like Facebook could collid with Netflix and Amazon' stream video ecosystems. But Facebook doesn't plan to spend hundr of million of dollar on big budget show likeHous of CardsandMan in the High Castle.Instead, Zuckerberg plan to focu on ""shorter-form content to start,"" note that the video will gener be split into content peopl produc social for friends, promot content from busi and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financ ""premium"" content to differenti it from other platforms. CFO David Wehner wa vagu about what that premium content would actual be, mere state that the compani wa ""look at a wide rang of content"" and ""work toward a revenu share model with creators.""Thos statement indic that Facebook want to carv out a nich on set top boxes, instead of trade costli blow with Netflix and Amazon. Sinc Facebook' video platform is all about deliv ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't be compet for Netflix or Amazon' subscription-bas revenues.I Facebook actual make a play for smart homes?Facebook' new set top box app could also help it gain a foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon ha alreadi establish a major presenc in home with it Kindl tablets, Fire TV set top boxes, and Echo speakers. Googl is tri to catch up with Home, andAppleteth devic to it HomeKit platform for iOS.Facebook doesn't have an offici hors in that race yet, but Zuckerberg recent showcas Jarvis, a smart home AI platform he develop for hi own home. The platform, which use voic command to control devices, is control via a Messeng bot.Imag source: Facebook.Bi expand Facebook' ecosystem to set top box like Appl TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network couldpotentiallypiggyback off that hardwar to sync with smart home devices. If Facebook link Messeng to those ""hubs"", it could take control of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and widen it moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other challengers.Th key takeawayFacebook' plan to expand it video ecosystem aren't surprising, and a dedic video app for set top box would be the logic next step. It won't challeng heavyweight like Netflix and Amazon, but it could captur a nich market of user who want to view Facebook video content on a stream platform optim for TVs. If the effort is successful, it could make it video ad more valuabl and give it a firm foundat for eventu challeng other smart home players.Find out whi Facebooki one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

At the recent industri SHOT Show trade show, American Outdoor Brand said that adjust firearm data in Decemb tumbl more than 17% from the year-ago period, with handgun plung 30%. Consid that firearm account for 88% of it revenues, can 2017 realli be American Outdoor Brand best year ever?Y betcha!Gun aren't go awayAlthough it' true that gun sale were lower in Decemb than they had been the previou year, break a19-month streakof ever higher monthli numbers, sale were still higher than ani other Decemb without an incid of domest terrorism. The month wa onli best by Decemb 2012 and Decemb 2015, month notabl for the tragic shoot in Sandi Hook and San Bernardino, California, respectively. It indic there' still plenti of latent demand for firearms, and the like reason is that person safeti ha becom a paramount issu for gun buyers.Imag source: Getti Images.Th most popular gun be bought today are thosedesign for conceal carry, small, lightweight weapon that still pack a wallop in firepower. And if the continu seri of protest and unrest are ani indication, concern for defens of self, family, and properti will remain uppermost on people' minds. Gun sale may not run at the blister pace they'v been at, but it' like they'll stay at elev levels.Th great outdoorsBeyond just guns, though, American Outdoor Brand is transform itself into a broader, more diversifi manufactur of product for the outdoor recreat industry. With a much larger target market -- some $30 billion to $35 billion, accord to AOB' management, compar to $14 billion for firearm -- there' much more opportun for growth.Whil there are a few, big-nam retail focus on servic the market, includ Bass Pro Shops,Cabela's, andDick' Sport Goods, not to mention mass merchandis likeWal-Martor onlin retail such asAmazon.com, it remain a veri fragment industri with some 12,000 independ retailers.

The stock ha been trend lower over the last two months, and share are current down 4.4% on the year.Techn AnalysisAAP wa recent trade at $163.09, down $14.74 from it 12-month high and $31.50 abov it 12-month low. Technic indic for AAP are bearish and the stock is a weak downward trend. The stock ha recent support abov $159.70, and ha resist below $168.50. Of the 18 analyst who cover the stock, six rate it a ""strong buy"", two rate it a ""buy"", eight rate it a ""hold"", and two rate it a ""strong sell"". The stock receiv S&P Capit IQ' 2 STAR ""Sell"" ranking.Analyst' ThoughtsAAP ha been trend lower over the last month, and the stock could use a solid earn report to bring back investor enthusiasm. The company' third-quart report wa solid, with result top estim on both the top and bottom lines, but the stock rose too sharpli on the news, and ha recent been give back some of those gains. If AAP is abl to follow up last quarter' report with anoth solid set of numbers, I would expect to see the stock quickli eras a larg portion of it recent losses. Analyst remain upbeat, set a price target of $177.69 on the stock, which is 8.9% abov it current trade price. Despit the bullish price target, the stock' recent weak suggest that Wall Street will drive the stock even lower if the company' quarterli number disappoint.Th biggest concern right now for both Advanc Auto and it biggest competitor AutoZon (AZO) is that Amazon (AMZN) is tri to aggress move into the market. Amazon ha recent made deal with some of the largest auto part makers, and the news of these contract hurt share of all the major auto part retailers. The good news for the sector is that a lot of part are purchas in store onli after some assist ha been made by a sale rep, and a lot of the part are veri time sensit and need to keep car on the road. Amazon is a concern, but it is not an immedi threat, and investor will come back into AAP as long as the quarterli number are not weaker than expected.Stock Onli TradeIf you'r look to establish a long stock posit in AAP, consid buy the stock under $163.00. Sell if it fall below $146.50 or take profit if it get to $187.50.Bullish TradeIf you want a bullish hedg trade on the stock, consid a March 140/145 bull-put credit spread for a 60-cent credit. That' a potenti 13.6% return (118.5% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 10.7% to caus a problem.Bearish TradeIf you want to take a bearish stanc on the stock at thi time, consid a March 175/180 bear-cal credit spread for a $0.35 credit. That' a potenti 7.5% return (65.4% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 7.5% to caus a problem.Cov Call TradeIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basi on a new position, you may want to consid a March $160.00 cover call. Buy AAP share (typic 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while sell the March $160.00 call for a debit of $154.80 per share. The trade ha a target assign return of 3.4%, and a target annual return of 30.0% (for comparison purpos only)."

Should You Buy Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhol Food Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) use to be the unparallel natur food leader. It use to be the onli real option, in much of America anyway, to find natural, organ and healthier foods. The compani rode it first-mov posit to domin and WFM stock soared.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)But as so often happen in capitalist economies, the competit arriv soon after.Earli thi decade, WFM stock seem unstoppable. Now share of the organ grocer have fallen by half from their prior peak, as investor fret over Whole Foods' slow growth rate and mount competit problems.A downturn in food price hasn't help either. Are the 365 store and WFM stock' dividend enough to support the share price here, or will it continu to fall?WFM Stock ConsGroceri Deflat Cycle:Ther ha been a big problem for groceri store as a sector: deflat in food prices. Mani common stapl have drop and then drop some more in price. Eggs, variou meats, cereal and even produc have been under heavi pressure. In theory, you'd think thi would caus higher margin for groceri stores. Gener cheaper input price are good for business. However, it hasn't work that way for groceri stores.Thi is becaus groceri store are profoundli competitive. There' veri littl moat around them - most store compet tooth and nail against variou other groceri stores, not to mentionWal-Mart Store Inc(NYSE:WMT). Custom gener have limit loyalti to individu stores, and are intens cost-sensitive. Think ga station as a compar business.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryA such, when food price decline, groceri store pass thi along to customers. Otherwise, the store across the street does, and you lose your shoppers. Thus, when groceri price fall, store are forc to push through virtual all the potenti cost savings. However, store are stuck with fix overhead. Leas costs, wage and other cost don't diminish when food price fall. When total revenu fall then it end up eat a fair chunk of the company' overal profitability. Whole Food find protection, to some degree, in it stronger brand, but it is not immune.Too Much Competition:Ther is a relat issue; the sector now find itself with too much competition. Groceri store had a good period, particularli one ride the organ trend. That caus manag team to expand heavily.Trad Joe's, for example, had just 300 store in 2013. It' up to 460 now. And accord to a recent Deutsch Bankcomparison, a basket of 77 similar product wa price 21% cheaper at Trader Joe' as compar with Whole Foods. Trader Joe' is hardli the onli threat.Sprout Farmer Market Inc(NASDAQ:SFM) ha grown revenu 22% a year compound over the past five years, and notch a 20% increas over the past 12 months.Aft thi rapid expans in the upscal groceri department, a period of store close - or at minimum reduc growth - and retrench is need to reduc the overal competit level and let profit margin tick up a few basi points.Expens WFM Stock:Yes, I know WFM stock ha lost roughli half it valu sinc it 2013 peak. But that doesn't automat make it cheap. In fact, WFM stock continu to trade at abov a price-earn ratio of 20. Sprouts, with it robust growth rate, trade at 20 time earn as well. When given the option of a compani grow at 20%/year such as Sprout or Whole Food with it shrink earnings, you should gener pick the former.Groceri stores, due to their low margins, tend to trade at modest P/E ratios. Walmart is far more than just a groceri store, but it is a similar low-margin busi and sell plenti of food. WMT stock is at just 14 time earnings. Pureplay grocer competitorKrog Co(NYSE:KR) trade at 16 time earnings. It' hard to argu for pay a premium on WFM stock given it recent oper issues.WFM Stock ProsFood Price to Rise:I suspect the deflationari food price trend will revers soon. To start with, there' an inflationari upturn in commod price generally. There' not necessarili ani direct correl between grain or meat price and the hard commodities, howev given the import of input cost and also gener investor sentiment across the asset class, one should expect firmer agricultur price if the commod ralli continues.Trump is a plu for food price if he gener more inflat generally. More specifically, cereal price have been down for a long period of time. Corn prices, for example, have plung sinc 2012. That benefit consum directly. American eat ton of corn in variou forms, and it also translat to lower feed prices, which ha help promot low meat and egg pricing. When corn goe up, it will boost food price across the spectrum.365 Stores:Whol Food is roll out a new smaller store format. Name 365, after it privat label brand products, these space-consci 28,000 squar foot store are up to 50% cheaper to open and oper than the mainlin Whole Food locations.Thes smaller store seem design to compet more directli with Trader Joe's. And so far,it is working, at least accord to management. The compani claim it ha seen mani Trader Joe' bag turn up in the new 365 stores. In ani case, Whole Food plan to have sever dozen of these store up and run shortly.Dec Dividend:WFM stock use to be a classic growth play. Up abov $50/share, most peopl involv held with high hope of groceri market domination. The collaps in the growth stori sent investor head for the exits. At today' more conserv price, a lot less need to go right to make WFM stock pay off.That' in part due to the increasingli attract dividend. WFM stock yield 56 cents/share, amount to a 1.9% yield. Not bad for a top brand, which, if thing go right, may becom a growth stori again.VerdictIf you'r look for a trade in WFM stock, thi is a decent place to consider. The margin pressur caus by fall food price should begin to eas up soon.How Option Trader Nail Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) EarningsWFM stock took a beating, and now look oversold. As an investment, however, the valuat still look iffy. And competit continu to mount an increas threat to Whole Foods' margin in the long term.At the time of thi writing, Ian Bezek own WMT stock. He had no posit in WFM stock.

How Charles Schwab Is Becoming the Amazon of Investing;2/3/2017;"Amazon ( AMZN) ha becom a behemoth in the retail world.Sure, the company' most recent earn report may have left a bit to be desired, but there is no deni how far Amazon ha come in a few short years. The compani easili domin the consum world, and it ha left a varieti of big box retail in it wake in the process.Whil we can point to a number of reason for Amazon' ascent, a key to their rise is clearli Amazon Prime. Thi subscript service-which cost $99/year-giv user free two day shipping, video content, music, and a number of other featur as well. The deal is so good that some estimateclos to half of the country' household have a Prime account, with plenti of new subscrib now be ad in foreign nation too.What is the point of this? Well, Prime member (at least in the U.S.)spend roughli twice as mucha non-Prim user on Amazon, while the servic ha an insan renew rate in the Unit States,ov 90% accordingto the Consum Intellig Research Partners, so peopl are clearli see the value.But with so mani servic and offer in the Prime package, how doe Amazon make ani money? Well, the idea is clearli to suck peopl in to the Amazon ecosystem via Prime, and then keep them there for years. And with such a high renew rate and spend that is doubl non-Prim users, it is clearli pay off. One onli need to look at the demis of other retail in a number of area to understand just how much Amazon is domin the consum world these days.So, the strategi is to give peopl an offer that is too good to refus in order to get them in the door and look at higher margin product later on. AsJeff Bezo said, Prime is 'such a good value, you'd be irrespons not to be a member'.Th Amazon of Investing?W can see how Amazon ha chang the world of retail and the consum market, but is anyon do the same thing for investing?I'd argu thatCharl Schwab( SCHW) is adopt thi 'Amazon model' in the world of investing, and thi is especi evid after their recent move.Their latest announcementbrought fee down to $6.95/trade from their previou spot at $8.95/trade, while Schwab also announc a fee cut on some of it broad market mutual funds, and that mutual fund cost would match their ETF counterpart too.Th compani will now charg 0.03% for it Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund ( SWPPX), while the Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund ( SWSSX) will cost 0.06% per year. Additionally, the compani also reduc fee for it Schwab U.S. Aggreg Bond Index Fund down to 0.04% (which come out later in February) to becom an ultra-cheap choic in that market too. They also discuss the idea of reduc fee for the Schwab U.S. TIP ETF ( SCHP) and their fundament index ETFs, but those chang will take place on March first.Thes cut put Schwab' fee down to level below it major competitors, Fidelity, E*Trad ( ETFC) andTD Ameritrade( AMTD), and it sent shockwav throughout the industry. Share price of ETFC and AMTD were down nearli 10% immedi follow the announcement, while SCHW took a hit as well.I understand whi the group wa hit in the market follow the press release, as it definit kick off worri over a price war. And as for Charl Schwab, charg such rock bottom level all but guarante that Charl Schwab will lose money on it fund business, and it will probabl see less revenu from it commiss in the process too.So Whi Is Thi Like Amazon?To me, thi is veri reminisc of the Amazon Prime service. You give peopl a ton of low cost option that are bound to pleas a wide rang of people. So, instead of two day ship and free video content, if you are in the invest world, you offer up fee that are less than major peer and nearly-fre ETF and mutual funds.Th move get plenti of peopl in the door, and it keep them insid the ecosystem. Onc you switch to Schwab for the low fee and start put money in their ETF and mutual funds, it becom difficult to justifi switch back. Thi is exactli like how you get use to the two-day shipping, music, Pantry, and other featur from Amazon, keep you stuck in the system. Charl Schwab, much like Amazon, realiz that win over new custom is a vital part of thi business, and that provid them low cost product is essenti to keep custom happi and away from the competit over the long-term.And onc you have enough custom that you suck in through the low price options, you now have the abil to earn money off them in differ ways. Amazon doe thi with a varieti of their media product and retail option in gener (such as Pantry), though there are obvious some key differ between the retail and invest worlds.Schwab can do someth similar to Amazon' approach nonetheless though. Bring peopl in for low cost index product and cheap trades, and then make the real profit off high margin activ that Amazon can onli dream of. These include, invest management, servic fees, and most importantly, invest the float.Thi last item will prove to be key for Schwab and other brokers, and especi if rate rise as most are expecting. For 2016, interest incom account for roughli 44% of Schwab' net revenues, and that wa in a year with mostli low-rates. Consid that trade revenu make up about 11% of the total revenu (look at 2016), and it is pretti reason to think that Schwab will be alright in the long term with a modest fee cut.I think that Schwab see the same thing with the write on the wall for a low rate environment. They are will to sacrific a bit in trade revenu now in order to get new user on the platform and get access to their potenti asset base and the invest float that come along with it. And if rate rise as most are expecting, thi could prove to pay off, and especi consid that interest make up a plural of revenu already, and that is with rate at ultra-low levels.So, while Schwab might be down on thi news now, it is a brilliant strategi in order to get more client and capit in the door over the long haul. It is thi type of forward think that ha propel Amazon to great in the consum market, and it is about time someon tri thi in the invest world as well.Want key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

Earnings Make Long Term Case For Visa (V) And MasterCard (MA);2/3/2017;"Back at the end of Novemb last year, I wrotean articlesuggest that those bullish on the prospect for “Cyber Monday” should consid play their belief in a way less obviou than simpli buy stock in Amazon (AMZN). The argument then wa that the expect for, and inde the valuat of, Amazon were such that even a decent holiday period for the onlin retail could provok onli a so-so reaction, wherea ani hint of weak could see the stock punished.Mi suggest then wa that investor should consid the major credit card compani MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) instead. Now that Q4 earn for all of the compani concern are out that seem to have play out pretti well, and the case for V and MA remain strong.To recap the card companies’ earnings, MasterCard, who releas on Monday, report number that were essenti in line, with a small beat of EP and a small miss in revenu terms, but highlight by sale growth of nearli ten percent on an annual basis. Visa report last night and beat on both the top and bottom lines, while also report notic growth.makeArticleAd();Som are quot the fact that transact process by Visa increas by 39% over last year, but that is not a direct comparison as the latest number includ transact from Visa Europe, while last year’ did not. A more reliabl indic of growth is U.S. transactions, which increas by a not too shabbi 12%.What make both V and MA such good long term play for investors, though, is the big pictur circumst that seem to be inexor move in their favor.Onlin shop continu to increas exponentially, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, and, despit the best effort of PayPal (PYPL) and others, credit and debit card remain the go to payment method for onlin shoppers. Visa and MasterCard combin account forov 85%of global payment volum in general, so even if onlin shop growth stall for some unforese reason, both compani look set to continu growing.At some point it is possibl that Bitcoin or some other virtual currenc will gain ground and do damag to that dominance, but at the moment that look far enough away to not present a realist problem to investors.A I point out in the abov referenc article, one of the strongest featur of the earn for both Visa and MasterCard is that they have spectacular margins, nudg 40% in both cases. The wider implement of new technolog such as microchip base transact will possibl hold those margin back for a while, but in the long run will increas profit by reduc the incid of fraud.Of course, if the entir global economi slow then card payment will suffer along with everyth else, but the cyclic natur of econom can’t be avoided. The simpl fact is that, as these recent earn releas have demonstrated, as long as peopl continu to buy things, and especi as those purchas continu to shift toward e-commerce, both Visa and MasterCard will continu to grow. On that basi they are stock that should be a part of everyone’ long term portfolio."
Stronger Jobs at 227K, Unemployment Ticks Up to 4.8%;2/3/2017;"Friday, Februari 3, 2017makeArticleAd();Ahead of the open bell thi Friday, new non-farm payrol job number were releas from the Bureau of Labor Statist (BLS), with 227K new job creat in the month of January, up from the consensu 174K expect from analysts. The unemploy rate rose a tenth of a percentag point to 4.8%, due to an increas in labor forc participation.Averag hourli earn did rise again, but onli by 0.1%. Thi figur year over year is +2.5%. Is it keep up with inflation? Just barely. Look for thi metric to continu increas in import as these monthli job number becom more clearli repres of the Trump administration.Revis to the past two month were rather considerable: +1000 job in Decemb to 157K, but down 40K in Novemb to 164K, an overal revis of -39K new job over the past quarter year.Industri by industry, Retail brought in the highest number of new hire at 46K, follow by Construct at 36K.

The U6 read - sometim refer to as ""real unemployment"" - rose to 9.4% after sever month in a row lower.Th Trump administr talk a lot about bring in lot of news jobs, but we'r look a littl tight in the U.S. labor forc these days. For sure there are plenti of Uber driver who'd rather be employ full-tim elsewher (not to pick on Uber, but to use them as a modern exampl of American labor), and it is encourag that more out-of-work citizen have begun to seek out new employ onc again. But skill-set match job open look to be one of the biggest concerns.We'v seen a lot of execut order from Trump so far in the earli day of hi administration, but noth yet on hi promis infrastructur program (which will presum includ build a big wall on our southern border, but may also includ repair bridges, airports, etc. throughout the country). These job ought to be forthcoming, but it' tough for analyst to includ in their model at thi point. How much money will Congress allot to such ends? No one realli know at thi stage.A shortag of skill labor in the Construct sector is someth that the administr and Congress may wish to address in bring new fund to blue-collar America' workforce.

Just how mani Eliza Doolittl app are there, and how fast can they be found?When TWLO stock deliv it earn on Feb. 7, we'll have a clue, and most analyst don't think they will like the answer. They expect revenu of just $73.92 million, and a loss of 5 to 6 cent per share, a narrow loss but no real growth, certainli noth worth a market cap of $2.63 billion.Twilio Stock Is a BattlegroundTh pessim is born out of how quickli the app busi is consolid around a few huge compani which, likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), have the size to deliv these function on their own, and which don't need to rent them.Thi ha made TWLO stock a battleground stock, subject to wild swing of fortune. After go public in June with a first trade at $21.30, Twilio stock rose to nearli $69 per share by late Septemb befor plung to $26.50 in earli January, open for trade Feb. 3 at around $30.50.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryIt wa ""a frumpi New Year"" in the word of InvestorPlac contributor Josh Enomoto. At $28 per share, he saw the downsid riska greaterthan the upsid potential. InvestorPlac contributor Chri Tyler agrees, suggest you don't even nibbl until TWLO stock test it low of $23.66and bounc off it.Aft all, you don't want to buyanotherFireEy Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE).Joseph Hargett is more bullish, say buyer arelin up to buyonc earn come out. Facebook itself is at the center of hi uncertainty. TWLO is part of Facebook Messenger, but it ha no contract with Facebook, which can cancel it deal at ani time.

Prove your valu to the wolf without the wherewith to attract your own pack, after all, can quickli turn you into wolf food.I suspect analyst are look too much at TWLO' next earn report and not enough at it real busi model, see it as a trade rather than an investment.Twilio is in the busi of have programm find creativ solut for common app problem within the cloud and sell those solut by subscription. It' possibl that Facebook may find anoth way around the secur sign-in problem, but TWLO CEO Jeff Lawson is build a shop that canfind other problem and other solutions, then deliv them.Whi Squar Inc (SQ) Stock Is Start to Pick Up It GrooveIn other words, if you'r bullish on Twilio stock, you don't just believ it can bring in revenu and profit from it current offerings, but that it can use it relationship to find problem and develop solut that go beyond disast respons and help user get back their passwords. To return to the begin of thi piece, you believ Eliza will marri Professor Higgin and find a happi ending.TWLO stock is a bet on cloud applic develop and on the model of sell solut through the cloud, use the cloud' own self-servic model. It' a bet Facebook and Amazon themselv are will to make, one that ha a longer time horizon than just next week.I think a longer-term investor should be will to play it that way, too.

The action camera maker' bottom-lin figur beat the Zack Consensu Estim of 12 cent by an impress 33%.However, the earn figur wa a result of sever adjust made to the huge GAAP loss that GoPro report (82 cent per share).Shar tumbl almost 14% at one point in late trade in the aftermath of the results, as investor were disillus with the company' bleak sale outlook for first-quart 2017. Thi wa in spite of the fact that thi wa the second biggest quarter in term of revenu in GoPro' history. The drab guidanc must have spook investor as 2017 wa suppos to be a turnaround time for GoPro and thi is a terribl start to the same.In addition, investor were like upset with the multipl miss opportun and goof-up that GoPro had thi quarter.Th huge GAAP loss of 82 cent for the quarter wa much wider than the 25 cent loss gener in the compar quarter last year.For full-year 2016, the compani report a non-GAAP net loss of $1.44 per share, in stark contrast to net incom of 76 cent in 2015.Insid the HeadlinesGoPro' revenu grew 23.8% from the prior-year quarter' talli to $540.6 million. Thi mark the company' return to revenu growth after four success quarter of sale declines. The top-lin figur still lag the Zack Consensu Estim of $576 million.Thi wa the first quarter that reflect the perform of the recent launch Hero5 camera and it consum drone Karma, and revenu were far short of the company' earlier guidanc of $625 million. The Karma recal hit the top line and manufactur issu relat to Hero5 camera also strain growth.Nevertheless, Hero5 Black wa the best-sel digit imag devic in unit and dollar in the U.S. and Europe. Also, Hero5 Black sold more unit in a singl quarter in Europe, in thi quarter, than ani other GoPro camera ever.For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin expand 990 bp year over year to 39.5%. Non-GAAP oper incom came in at $31.6 million, as against an oper loss of $21.6 million gener last year.R&D expens were up almost 40% year over year, driven by invest in HERO5 cameras, Karma, accessori and software. In addition, sale and market expens shot up 36% year over year.Th compani recent launch GoPro Plu - a cloud-bas subscript servic - that enabl auto-upload of footag from a GoPro camera to a GoPro Plu cloud account for on-the-go access, edit and share use a smartphon and the Quik app. Even though it is earli days, the GoPro Plu is enjoy high retent rate in the U.S. and it subscrib base seem to be expanding.In the quarter, the rebrand Quik mobil app wa download over 4 million time (up almost 30% sequentially), as it activ user and monthli export tripl in Dec 2016 over the prior year.For full-year 2016, revenu plung 26.8% year over year to $1.62 billion.Not DevelopmentsTil date, GoPro' Hero 5 Black camera and Karma drone have face product issu and delay shipments, which restrain the company' abil to meet demand in the quarter. The company' new product also had a rocki start with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, as GoPro had temporarili stop sell them on the e-commerc site in mid Octob due to a price dispute.Further, suppli constraint made retail cancel market support of GoPro' new products, particularli it new Hero 5 camera, which obvious hurt revenues. Further, the compani had to announc a recal of it new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of it commerci launch, as a few of them lost power dure flight due to batteri issues. Thi wa also a huge setback for the company.However, earlier thi week, the compani resum Karma sale and the compani plan to ramp product further. Karma is schedul to be avail in intern market thi spring. We believ that GoPro is well set to capit on the fast-grow consum drone market.Th compani also launch sever accessori dure the quarter, includ Karma Grip, a handheld stabilizer; Remo, a waterproof, voice-activ remot and Quik Key, a microSD card reader enabl quick edit and share from smartphones.LiquidityExit the quarter, the compani had cash and cash equival of $192.1 million, down significantli from $280 million a year back.GuidanceIn light of such unfortun event and uncertain market reaction, the compani gave a veri disappoint guidanc for first-quart 2017. It project revenu for the current quarter in the rang of $190-$210 million, which is well below the Zack Consensu Estim of $268 million for the quarter. The compani expect gross margin in the low 30% range.GoPro refrain from offer specif revenu or margin guidanc for full-year 2017.However, GoPro declar plan to limit it adjust oper expens in 2017 to $600 million, in an attempt to tri to return to full-year profit next year. Thi is compar to a 2016 figur of about $709 million.GoPro should be abl to attain these massiv cost reductions, in light of it recent busi restructuring, which did away with mani high-cost oper includ it entertain division.It is like that GoPro' sale will gradual improv as it ramp product and expand Karma' reach to intern markets. Thi will supplement it cost-reduct initi and enabl it to achiev sustained, profit growth.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIn recent months, the compani ha been grappl to achiev it earlier growth and go beyond it trademark action cameras. GoPro had earlier reduc it inventori of older legaci cameras, in order to prepar for it new products. However, what follow wa more oper stumbl and messed-up product launches.Th compani ha also been face pressur to establish a more mainstream market for it cameras. However, tough competit from smartphon brand such as Appl Inc.AAPLand Samsung Electron Corp. ha been make it difficult for the company.Despit all the problem that GoPro is strain under, the compani is confid of strong demand trajectori for it latest product and is expect to return to double-digit growth in 2017.Howev big the issu it faces, GoPro still boast an enviabl retail presence. Extrem few consum technolog compani have the kind of retail presenc that GoPro ha and thi might work in favour of the company.

KLA-Tencor, Iconix Brand Group and Amazon highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/3/2017;"For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - Februari 03, 2017 -Zack Equiti ResearchhighlightsKLA-Tencor(NASDAQ:KLAC-Fre Report) as the Bull of the Day andIconix BrandGroup (NASDAQ:ICON-Fre Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zack Equiti Research provid analysi onAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report).Her is a synopsi of all three stocks:Bul of the Day:KLA-Tencor(NASDAQ:KLAC-Fre Report) recent beat the Zack Consensu Estim and then guid Wall Street higher which ha sent estim higher. Thi ha caus the Zack Rank to move up to a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and today it is the Bull of the Day.Th last sever month have been veri good one to the semiconductor stocks. It look like there is evid that the run will continu if not pick up speed. Other high profil name have seen renew interest from analyst as Artifici Intelligence, Autonom Driving, and 3-D Virtual Realiti concept begin to move from beta into the mainstream. Thi is all good news for the chip industry.DescriptionKLAC is a semiconductor capit equip company, they make the equip that will help the chip compani make their chips.Rec EarningsKLA Tencor beat the Zack Consensu Estim of $1.41 by $0.11 in post earn of $1.52. That translat into a posit earn surpris of 7.8% mark the 10th straight beat of the Zack Consensu Estimate.Guid call for revenu of between $860M - $920M when the consensu estim wa call for $849M. As the aggress growth stock strategist at Zacks, thi is what I love to see. Also on the call, manag note that they expect CY17 gross margin to be a ""coupl hundr basi points"" better than previous expected.It world of beat and rais thi stock ha higher revenu and higher margins. Usually, when that happen you see higher multiples. Speak of multiples, KLAC trade at 15.6x forward estim and over the last two year the stock ha trade between 13.2x and 17.8x. Thi tell me that the stock could go as high as $109 (17.8*6.17) if it trade at the high end of the rang over the last two years.Room for Upgrad for KLACOn thing that I like to see is a stock that ha room for futur catalysts. KLAC ha three brokerag that have ""Hold"" or equival rate on the stock. Instinet is by far the most bearish of the three with a price target of $78 and a neutral rating. Stifel Nicolau ha a hold and a price target of $83. A few day after the most recent report Deutsch Bank reiter their ""Hold"" on the stock and increas their price target from $78 to $85.Goldman Sachs, Cowen and Company, Credit Suise, B. Riley and Needham all have KLAC at either ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" or the equivalent. Of those, B. Riley is the most bullish with a $106 price target and Needham is just a dollar behind at $105.The Big Tell for KLACOv the year I have pick up on the lingo for chip stocks. At first I learn all about book to bill and after that the focu becam backlog. More recent I have pick up an even bigger tell than a stock with record bill or record backlog. The phrase that pay is ""design wins.""Dur the most recent confer call manag spoke the phrase that pay when talk to 3D NAND. If there is anyth that is as good as a design win, I have yet to know what it is. Thi ensur some high margin busi over the next 6 to 18 months, and that alon should have the multipl for thi stock increasing.Bear of the Day:Iconix BrandGroup (NASDAQ:ICON-Fre Report) is a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and it is the Bear of the Day. Let' take a look at whi the stock is the Bear of the Day and if there are some trend that might help investor avoid other stock that could becom a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell).DescriptionICON is a brand manag company.

Usual I see a bunch of miss but ICON ha 3 straight beat of the Zack Consensu Estimate. That is pretti good.EstimatesEstim revis are the key to the Zack Rank. As estim fall, so doe the Rank. The current quarter estim is at $0.14, but that is down from $0.19 about 90 day ago. The current year estim of $1.11 is down 2 cent from about 90 day ago as well. Both of those item don't help, but the real issu here is the move in 2017 estimates.Th 2017 Zack Consensu Estim move from $1.08 to $1.00 in the last thirti days.

Sinc the compani went public in 1997, it stock ha grown over 54,000% and the compani is now one of thetop five most valuabl companiesbi market capitalization. Peopl are alway look for compani that are set to succeed as well as Amazon has, and that lead me to Mark Twain, who is credit with say that ""histori doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.""Tak a Twain approach to find the next Amazon-lik investment,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) come to the forefront as share three success factor with Amazon while have one critic differ that might put it at a disadvantag in term of grow to Amazon' size.SimilaritiesDifferenceFounder-l with long-term vision.Obsess with customers' experience.Invest aggress for growth.Shopify' total address market is much smaller than Amazon's.Let' compar these three success factor and the one differ to see how Amazon-lik Shopifi realli is.Founder-l with long-term visionA founder can have a signific impact in shape the cultur of a company. Jeff Bezos, Amazon' CEO and founder, did thi earli in the company' histori by emphas in hi first letter to sharehold hi determin to have hi compani succeed over the long term.W believ that a fundament measur of our success will be the sharehold valu we creat over the long term. Thi valu will be a direct result of our abil to extend and solidifi our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more power our econom model.Tobi Lutke, Shopify' founder and CEO, ha a similar mandate. Lutke' letter to sharehold in the company' 2015 public file declar long-term valu more import than the short term.In order to build long-term value, we decid to forgo short-term revenu opportun and nurtur the peopl who were put their trust in Shopify. ... Thi is a prime exampl of how we approach valu and someth that potenti investor must understand: we do not chase revenu as the primari driver of our business. ... we have alway priorit long-term valu over short-term revenu opportunities.Hav the long-term view ha paid off for Amazon and it shareholders, and it seem that Shopifi ha the same mindset. Lutk boldli end hi letter to sharehold saying, ""I want Shopifi to be a compani that see the next century."" How' that for the long-term view?Obsess with the custom experienceA a longtim custom of Amazon, I have seen the custom experi get better and better. Enhanc in search, order experience, fulfillment, account management, and surpris extra seem commonplace. Thi is not by accident. Bezo use the phrase ""obsess over customers"" in hi first sharehold letter and he ha not relent on hi passion for pleas customers. He includ the origin 1997 sharehold letter everi year in Amazon' annual report.Similarly, Shopifi understand it success is tie to the success of it customers. Wherea Amazon' custom are consumers, Shopify' custom are merchant sell their good on Shopify' e-commerc platform. Like Amazon, the idea of custom focu ha been core to Shopifi from the beginning. Lutk ha a letter on the Shopifi investor home page where he describ Shopify' focu on the customer. It say in part:Shopifi is exactli this: the onli platform you need to build your empire. Shopifi is the first thing our merchant log into in the morn and the last thing they log out of in the evening. It' at the heart of their busi -- a respons that we take veri seriously. ... our job is to make our merchant look their veri best in everi interact they have with consumers.Shopify' success is align with the success of it customers. When Shopify' custom are successful, Shopifi make more money in subscript and transact fees. Shopifi ha provid signific resourc to help it client run success e-commerc businesses, includ company-facilit custom meet-ups, a user community, video how-to guides, a podcast, and even a directori of Shopifi expert that merchant can use for almost ani aspect of e-commerc business. Lastly, even if the core Shopifi platform doesn't meet your needs, Shopifi host an app store with over 1,500 apps. Shopify' relentless focu on the custom continu today. Lutk mention in the most recent earn release: ""Our accomplish over the last few month support the strategi we have made clear from the beginning, which is to do the thing that help merchant succeed""Shopifi score a checkmark in the first two Amazon key to success. Let' look at the third success factor and how Shopifi share a similar aggress invest strategi with the e-commerc and could-comput titan.Invest aggress to growAmazon didn't report a profit until 2003, which wa six long year after go public. The reason Amazon didn't post a profit wa becaus it wa invest heavili to grow it business.Amazon ha continu to invest in it busi and thi impact the company' most recent quarter. Amazon cite invest in fulfil centers, digit content, intern growth, Alexa/Echo, and AW asreason for lower profit in Q3.Shopifi hasn't post a profit as long as it' been report result publicly. But, as I note inthi article, Shopify' core busi ha healthi gross margin and could be profit if it weren't invest heavili in growth initiatives. In Shopify' file to go public, Shopifi provid detail about these invest including:Market activities.Expand partner referr programs.Research and develop to introduc new product and services.Maintain a high level of merchant servic and support.Data center and network infrastructure.In it most recent earn call Chief Financi Offic Russ Jone directli link these invest to Shopify' abil to continu grow.... we believ the primari reason we will continu to gain share of thi grow pie is ... our strateg focu on merchant success. Thi mean continu reevalu the platform capabl necessari for merchant to thrive at everi stage of growth and also invest in the partnership and project that we believ will help future-proof their success.Shopifi score a win on all three of these Amazon success factors, but there' one import differ between Amazon and Shopifi that investor need to keep in mind.Tot address marketImag source: Amazon.comAmazon' logo ha an arrow start at the ""a"" in it name and go to the ""z"", which is a subtl remind that Amazon want to make it websit the place consum go to buy just about anything.Whil Shopifi is an e-commerc busi like Amazon, Shopifi doesn't sell good to consumers. Shopifi provid a suit of e-commerc tool to enabl entrepreneur and small-busi owner to start and run an e-commerc busi quickli and simply. Shopifi make money from subscript fee from these busi owner and transact fee when they sell good over the Shopifi platform.Retail e-commerc is estim to reach more than $4 trillion in the next few years, give Amazon a huge total address market (TAM). Shopify' TAM is more modest. Shopifi provid TAM detail about the small and medium busi (SMB) market it serv in the company' file to go public.... we focu on sell to SMBs. We have merchant in approxim 150 countries... Accord to AMI Partners, in 2014, there were approxim 10 million merchant with less than 500 employe oper in our key geographies, and approxim 46 million such merchant worldwide.At the time, Shopifi estim that it annual revenu per merchant wa about $1,000. Given that as a baseline, Shopify' total address market in it key geographi would be $10 billion, and worldwid would be $46 billion. Shopifi goe on to say that it market will expand as more entrepreneur start busi and as Shopifi gain more revenu per merchant. Given that Shopify' trailing-12-month revenu is $329 million, Shopifi still ha plenti of room to grow.Shopifi look and act a lot like Amazon, and that' a realli good thing for investors. Despit the differ in the companies' total address markets, investor should be excit about Shopify' Amazon-lik trait in the larg and grow e-commerc marketplace.10 stock we like better than ShopifyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Presid Trump' campaign promises, if enacted, have the abil to reach everi corner of the stock market.Hi promis chang to the busi tax code would impact everi business. Hi promis chang to the person incom tax code would impact nearli everi consumer. Hi promis infrastructur spend would increas inflat for the entir nation. Hi promis chang to the Afford Care Act (ACA) would impact nearli everi employee. Hi promis relax of govern regul would affect nearli everi employer. The list goe on and on.Look at the market through thi lens, there is not a compani or stock that will not be impact in some way by the Trump presidency. However, not all compani will be impact to the same extent. Some compani are more vulner - for good or bad - to the promis polici chang than others.For instance, larg bank and other financi institut - likeGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - have been the unriv beneficiari of a Trump presid up to thi point, becaus so mani of the president' suggest chang benefit the banks' bottom lines. Rise inflation, lower corpor tax and decreas regul all benefit the banks.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryConversely, biotech compani - likeBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) - have struggl in the aftermath of the presidenti elect becaus the uncertainti swirl around what will eventu replac the ACA after the Republican-control Congress repeal it, coupl with the pointedTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and interview critic Presid Trump ha issu regard the high price of pharmaceut and other medic treatments, ha creat a tremend amount of uncertainti in the healthcar industry.So which compani are less vulner to the potenti polici chang and polit whim of the president?Whil it' import to note that no compani is immun from the potenti threat of a target Twitter tirad from the presid should it happen to draw hi ire, there doe seem to be a group of stock that could bullishli go on it merri way dure the first half of 2017 without have to look over it shoulder everi morn to see if some new polici decis may threaten to derail it progress: the ""FANG"" stocks.Th FANG stock -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) [formerli Google, henc the ""G""] - have been Wall Street darl for the past few years. The shift consum have made to live in an onlin world for everyth from their social network to shop ha push the valuat of these compani ever higher as trader bet on thi trend continuing, regardless of what els happen in the economy.Th FANG stock took an initi hit after the result of the presidenti elect were announc in earli November, as trader start take profit on some of their more lucr posit and rotat that money into the financi sector and other sector that were pois to ralli follow Presid Trump' win. Nobodi wa doubt the strength of the FANG stock - they just need to free up cash to invest in even hotter stock at the time.Onc the initi rotat wa complete, investor start come back to the FANG stocks, which were then trade at much more favor valuations, and start buy them up. After all, whatev happen to inflation, whatev happen with the tax code, whatev happen with health care, consum are go to continu connect with friend on Facebook, buy more stuff on Amazon, watch video on Netflix and search for inform on Google.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Firework SoonW expect the FANG stock and other tech stock like them - stock likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - to continu to do well dure the next few months.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weapon;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is often compar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which isn't alway accurate. Most notably, Alibaba doesn't hold inventori like it larger U.S. peer, and it doesn't have AMZN' massiv distribut capabilities. But, there is one notabl similar that doesn't seem price into BABA stock at the moment:makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA large, fast-grow cloud comput offering.Amazon' cloud business, call Amazon Web Servic (AWS), ha been a major factor in the rise of AMZN stock from less than $200 to more than $800 over the past five years.Alibaba Cloud is still much smaller, but it growth profil look much like that of AW back in 2011-12. That explos growth - and the abil to be a legitim competitor to Amazon.com andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) - ha the potenti to drive signific addit upsid in BABA stock.Th Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA StockSo far, the cloud busi hasn't done much for Alibaba' revenue, or BABA stock, for that matter. BABA still trade around $100, basic the same level at which it went public in late 2014.Through the first nine month of fiscal 2016, cloud ha gener just 3.3% of total revenue. Over the past four quarters, Alibaba' cloud sale total just $765 million - like less than 6% of what AW will creat in calendar 2016. And at the moment, Alibaba' cloud busi actual is a drag on BABA earnings. The busi ha lost $92 million in EBITA (not EBITDA; BABA use EBITA for segment income) over the past four quarters.3 BRIC Buy That Play Banking, Buy and ... Beef?But the gap to Amazon and the loss in the busi have more to do with Alibaba' rel late start than with a lack of demand. Cloud revenu growth ha been impressive, increas 130% through the first nine month of fiscal 2016, and 115% in the Decemb quarter, despit a price cut.That follow a 138% increas in cloud sale in fiscal 2016. Most impressively, the number of custom nearli doubl year-over-year in Q3, and BABA ad 114,000 new custom in the Decemb quarter alone.A for profitability, Alibaba isn't worried, yet, with manag say on the Q3 confer call it wa spend to gain market share. Profit will come, but for now, Alibaba is look to cement it domin of the lucr Chines market.Loss now are OK - AW lost money until recent - becaus those new custom will provid high-margin recur revenu go forward, possibl for decades.Th Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA Stock Go ForwardTh good news for BABA stock is that it look like the cloud busi is near an inflect point. Loss are narrowing, but still repres a drag on overal earn for BABA. Over the past 12 months, cloud ha actual had a neg impact on EP of about $0.03. That will chang shortly, as Alibaba ha said that the busi will hit a profit around 1 million users, a mileston almost certain to be hit in 2017.The question is what happen after that. If Alibaba' growth look anyth like Amazon' go forward, it should be veri posit for BABA stock.AMZN didn't break out cloud revenu until 2015; it appear that the busi gener about $1 billion in sale in 2011 and $2 billion in 2012. That then grew to almost $4 billion in 2013, $5.6 billion in 2014, and $7.9 billion in 2015. 2016 growth to date suggest a figur over $12 billion in 2016. AW is now estim by analyst to be worth (on it own) about $150-$160 billion.Can Alibaba grow it cloud busi to the same extent? Goldman Sach analyst argu it could,project a valuefor Alibaba Cloud of $42 billion by 2019, base on $5 billion in sales. That growth alon would add almost 20% to the valu of BABA stock over the next few year and it' not as outlandish as it seems.Th Futur Look Bright for BABA StockGrowth rate have been over 100%, yet cloud comput is still rel unknown in China. On the Q3 confer call, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang estim that, even assum price discount to lure custom use hard drives, the address market for cloud in China would be $30 billion. And in November, Alibaba ad new data center in four locat worldwide: Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai and Germany.Th concern might be whether a Chines compani will be abl to compet intern with Amazon and Microsoft. U.S. compani might prefer domest providers, and elsewher there could be worri about security.But, the revers of that argument is that Alibaba should have a huge advantag in market to Chines consumers, as those custom might be similarli unwil to use American compani for their cloud services. Even with BABA now worth approxim $250 billion, the $30 billion Chines market is more than enough to provid a materi catalyst.3 Stock to Buy for Better Deal Than the Great RecessionAW profit margin alreadi arenear 25%despit it own spend in that business. Assum Alibaba can get half of the Chines market at 30% margins, the cloud segment could contribut as much as $1.50 per share in EP annually, enough to add $30 billion-$40 billion in market value. Ani intern success would simpli add to that value.Until now, the busi hasn't been a focu of BABA stock investors, but that seem like to change. When the compani hit the 1 million mark and turn cloud profit in 2017, coverag of the busi should like increase. And, further awar of that driver seem equal like to drive upsid for BABA stock. Investor should consid get long in Alibaba stock befor the rest of the market figur that out.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsTh Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruarySear Hold Corp (SHLD): A Great American Tragedi Near It EndTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Ha a Secret Weaponappear first onInvestorPlace."

But instead of the Lone Star state, you should be think about … Brazil.Brazil is the world' largest export of beef and poultry. AndBRF SA (ADR)(NYSE:BRFS) just happen to take the crown when it come to that exporting. The former Brasil Food ship it meat to more than 150 differ countri - both emerg and develop - around the world.BRF SA is a (pardon the pun) prime exampl of how countri of origin can be meaningless.

Still, BRF is treat like a castaway, pay just 6 time forward earn despit a nearli 3% dividend yield to boot.BRIC Stock to Buy: HDFC Bank (HDB)India ha a popul of 1.25 billion (at least as of 2013), and it' one of the best emerg market to own for rise consumerism.Whil that mean a boon for consum stocks, it also mean big thing for financi services.

While it growth isn't as breakneck as it use to be, and while other EM are grow more quickly, China still ha enorm potenti not just becaus of it own populace, but the potenti for intern expans by it larger firms.Thus, if you were to buy and hold just one Chines stock, it would have to beAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA).Heck, it might even be the best tech stock acrossallmarkets.InvestorPlace'sJeff Reevespoint out at MarketWatchthat:""China' internet popul just surpass 730 million after a roughli 6% growth rate last year.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Googl Earn (Shutterstock photo)A a gener rule, the market is pretti good about learn from it mistakes. After all, there is noth like a hefti loss to teach trader what not to do.That is a simpl fact that must be born in mind when look for pattern in pricing; if the pattern involv a reaction to news that wa ultim proven wrong, it is unlik to repeat veri often, and the few opportun when it doe should be grab with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what make Googl parent compani Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after it reaction to Q4 earnings.A you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’ earn report Googl (I’m sorri but I just can’t bring myself to call the compani “Alphabet”) had drop sharpli on earn miss contain in two of the previou three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportun to buy the stock at a discount. There are differ circumst thi time around, of course, but the dynam that ha made neg reaction to earn in the past opportun is still in place, so the end result is like to be the same.Th biggest problem with the Q4 result as far as trader were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click wa down, and oper cost had risen to the point where earn per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’ estim of around $9.64. Still, revenu of $26.06 billion beat the estim $25.26 billion.Ther wa also a concern lurk in the background regard Googl take on both Amazon (AMZN)’ Echo and Appl (AAPL)’ iPhon with recent hardwar launches. Googl said that they were pleas with the reaction to both Googl Home and the Pixel phone without go into specifics, but doubt about the wisdom of the strategi persist.I actual believ that Googl ha a chanc of limit success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphil struggl as the iPhone’ domin of the mobil phone market is well established. Most estim of sale of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardli put a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profit as a nich product.Hom ha an easier, more logic path to success as Googl is the natur choic of those look for what is, essentially, a free-stand search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is go to be the driver of the recoveri in the stock price that histori suggest will come soon.First, the increas in oper cost that Googl report seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of invest in the core business. Loss in what the compani call “Other Bets,” thing like “Nest” and self drive cars, were actual reduc somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there wa signific progress on the autonom vehicl front.Th possibl of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are gener seen as the leader in driverless car research and technology.Th other issue, of fall cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seem on the surface. It reflect a continu move to mobil that result in that metric falling, but the volum of click increasing. The same issu was, in part, respons for the April and Octob drop in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tell the stori of how long it wa until investor realiz that volum more than offset fall CPC.Look at Google’ result and the market reaction to them, I get a sens of déjà vu. We have actual been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investor a chanc to buy cheaply. It seem that in thi case the market is still learn from it mistak and over time the outcom here is most like to be the same."

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn of the biggest neg surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company' sky-high price-to-earn ratio. Accord to Googl Finance, AMZN stock current trade at an eye-pop 191 time it trail earn of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon ha at least given investor the courtesi of grow profit to tri to somewhat justifi the lofti valuation. That 191x is on trail 12-month earn of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earn $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translat into 52 cent per share.It' obviou Amazon stock investor care about growth, not valuation. AMZN' sky-high P/E ha been in place for years, and will like continu for some time.And that' actual OK. Here are two import reason why:Amazon Revenu GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stori in today' market.When the compani releas 2016' final number Thursday, Feb. 2, analyst expect Amazon to post revenu of $137 billion. That' an improv of more than 25% versu 2015' top line - a difficult feat when you'r talk about 12-digit sales. And Amazon' $107 billion in revenu last year wa 20% better than 2014.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryW live in a world in whichS&P 500constitu are do well if they'r post just single-digit increas on the top line. You can blame thi at least partli on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weigh down American multinationals. But the fact remain that meaning growth is a scarc qualiti in today' stock market - especi among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easi way for investor to get access to big growth with rel littl risk.And Amazon is hardli run out of fuel. The compani ha onli begun to expand into groceri and apparel - two huge categories. Trillion of dollar are spent worldwid each year at physic stores. That' not to mention the other gain Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Servic cloud offer and other newer initiatives.Analyst predict Amazon' revenu will increas anoth 22% in 2017, hit $168 billion. So again - the growth stori is still well intact.But it' not all about growth. Mani AMZN stock bull argu that we'r just look at earn the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?On thing that separ Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo from mani other execut is hi abil to look at the really,reallylong-term. He' also will to spend billion of dollar on ideas, and is OK with hit a few dud if it mean spawn great new ideas.Rememb the company' smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a websit call Askville? I'm guess you might rememb the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on it smartphon alone.Thi kind of risk take is an inher part of Amazon' culture. It' the line of think that prod the compani to introduc some of it biggest winner to date, like cloud services, Prime ship and the Kindle.Thus, mani investor look at AMZN stock in a differ way. They look at the company' oper profit, then they add back it substanti research and develop cost to get a ""truer"" sens of profitability.Admittedly, that chang the pictur dramatically.Appl Inc. Bulls: Bewar These Charts! (AAPL)In it most recent quarter, Amazon produc net incom of $252 million, which across 485 million dilut share becam dilut earn of 52 cent per share. At the time, AMZN wa trade at $822 per share. If we annual that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterli earn fluctuat - thi is just for an example), we'r look at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also report oper profit of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a signific expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annual that, then divid the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let' take the actual numbers. Amazon current trade for 190 time trail 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and post oper profit of more than $4 billion. That come to $40.19 per share combined, and put AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That' a lot of creativ accounting, so take that with a spoon of salt. But it' an interest argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continu to be one of the best growth stori in today' market. As long as that continues, investor aren't go to care about the headlin P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock ha doubl sever time over despit it.Amazon is solidli profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as larg as investor typic would like. But those earn are be reinvest back in the busi - which is what a high-growth compani like Amazon should be do anyway.A of thi writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceWhi Amazon.com, Inc.

Why Amazon’s Move Toward Autonomous Vehicles Could Be Key to Its Bottom Line;2/1/2017;"E-commerc giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) wa recent grant a patent that signal it potenti move into self-driv vehicles. The patent indic that Amazon is tri to build a technolog wherebi vehicl can commun with each other while approach a road with a revers lane.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th abstract of the patent says:A roadway manag system can gener lane configur for a roadway or a portion of the roadway. The roadway manag system can determin the direct of travel for lane in a roadway and direct autonom automobil to enter the roadway in a particular lane.Thi patent is an indic that the compani could be work on autonom vehicl technology. Someth that lend support to thi idea is that Amazon' technic advisor for Prime Air -- Jim Curland -- is one of the inventor of the roadway manag patent.Curland is current work on develop the technolog to deliv Amazon order via drone in 30 minut or less. Thi mean that he is alreadi involv in the process of autom deliveries, and autonom truck are the next logic step.What doe the patent mean for Amazon?With Amazon' technology, autonom vehicl will be abl to safe plan their rout and better navig the correct lane on a revers road in advance. The patent also point toward the develop of a roadway manag system wherein vehicl can commun with each other and coordin their movements.Thes develop could have widespread ramif for the compani in two ways. First, Amazon will be abl to reduc it ship expens as deliveri truck will spend less time in traffic after calcul the best rout in advance. Thi will lead to lower fuel cost and faster transit times. Second, as Amazon is go to both own and oper thi technology, the compani can licens it to other automak for a fee.Th first point, however, is current of greater import for Amazon sinc it would allow the compani to bring down balloon ship costs.Deliveri cost go through the roofAmazon' outbound ship cost have grown quickli in recent years, far outpacinggrowth in the company' ship revenue.Data source: Statista. Chart by author.Thes ship cost will rise onc again for 2016. Worldwid ship cost in the first nine month of 2016 increas 40% from the prior-year period to $10.5 billion. Amazon wa expect to add at least anoth $3.9 billion in ship cost dure the fourth quarter, give us a total spend for 2016 of $14.4 billion.Th company' unwav focu on reduc ship time for custom -- especi Prime member -- is larg responsible. Cost could rise further in the futur as the compani roll out it one-to-two hour deliveri to more locations. As a result, Amazon is work toward the develop of autonom deliveri technolog like drone and self-driv truck to reduc both personnel and fuel costs.Whi self-driv truck are a natur progress for AmazonAmazon ha not provid specif detail for how it plan to use the patent yet, but recent develop point toward the eventu realiti that Amazon will roll out self-driv truck at some point in the future.In Dec. 2015, Amazon purchas ""thousands"" of truck trailer in order to move good between warehouses. Then, in Jan. 2016, the compani acquir a 100% stake in packag deliveri compani Coli Privé in order to expand it last-mil deliveri capabilities. It appear Amazon is gradual build a deliveri system that it person owns, so it may have greater control over the movement of goods.And accord to Busi Insider, Amazon is also expect to launch an app thi summer that will match trucker with shippers, creat an Uber-lik marketplac for transport and delivery. Thi move will allow Amazon to elimin a 15% brokerag fee that need to be paid to the middlemen as it can get in touch directli with truck companies. The app can also improv the effici of transport as it is expect to provid drive direct and truck stop recommend by plan the rout and estim time in advance.Thes move seem to complement the broad strategi of exert more control over the suppli infrastructur as Amazon reduc cost wherev possible, boost profit and expedit the deliveri process at the same time.Find out whi Amazon.comi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

In the prior quarter, the CFO point out that there could be""meaningful""drop.OK then, whi might there be a slowdown? First of all, it will probabl get tougher to find new users. For example, Facebook is ban in China. And rival in the country, likeWeibo Corp (ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTenc Hold Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), have been capit on the opportunity.Besides, the fourth-quart growth wa bolster with holiday spend - which drive quit a bit of ad spend - as well as the presidenti election, which reli heavili on social media. Oh, and then there wa the controversi with ""fake news."" FB ha alreadi implement system to reduc this, which could result in fewer clicks.And finally, Wall Street' reaction to the Q4 result ha been fairli muted. Hey, shouldn't there be more of a spike - given the huge growth numbers? Then again, investor have alreadi been factor in much of the good news - and then some.

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?;2/1/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent announc that it will invest over $1 billion per year on cybersecur research and development. That amount, which is equival to roughli 8% of it R&D spend over the past 12 months, doesn't includ ani acquisit that Microsoft might make. Let' see whi Microsoft is beef up it cybersecur efforts, and what that could mean for smaller player across the fragment industry.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecur mean to MicrosoftMicrosoft' Window is the most wide use PC oper system in the world, Offic is the most popular product suite, and Azur is the second largest cloud platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of thi massiv ecosystem ha tradit been protect by third parti companies. Microsoft' own product -- like Window Firewall, Window Defender, and Microsoft Secur Essenti -- were often consid inferior to third-parti ones.However, Microsoft' ecosystem ha becom more cohes under CEO Satya Nadella' ""One Windows"" strategy, which aim to instal the same OS and app store across multipl platforms. Sinc user would ideal download app from the Window Store and deliv their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logic to add first-party, self-upd secur solut across the entir ecosystem. Microsoft claim that the number of weekli cyber attack ha risen from 20,000 to as mani as 700,000 over the past two to three years.To counter those threat while expand it ecosystem, Microsoft acquir three Isra cybersecur firm over the past two year -- enterpris secur start-up Aorato, cloud secur firm Adallom, and data protect firmSecur Islands. Those acquisit and it plan R&D invest could help Azur challeng AWS, which alreadi integr an arsen of secur featur into it cloud infrastructur platform. Azure' revenu surg 93% annual last quarter, but Microsoft hasn't reveal it exact sale figur yet.How thi could hurt smaller playersA Microsoft' cybersecur ecosystem grows, it could overlap with the servic of mani smaller stand-alon third-parti players. For example, Microsoft recent launch Window Defend ATP (Advanc Threat Protection) for Window 10. That endpoint servic match event with Microsoft' cloud-bas Secur Graph, which gather data across over a billion Window devic worldwide. It also work with Microsoft' email protect servic from Offic 365 and Microsoft Advanc Threat Analytics.Thi platform directli compet against ""perimeter"" player like threat prevent firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewal vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . Dure last year' RSA Conference, Microsoft princip research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Window Defend ATP can ""help captur network traffic out of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks"" as FireEy and other threat detect services.Consid what $1 billion mean to these smaller cybersecur companies. Palo Alto and FireEy are expect to respect gener $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenu thi year -- so there' no way that they could match Microsoft' R&D investments. Windows, Offic 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other platform all give Microsoft the abil to bundl and scale up it cybersecur servic veri quickly. It can also offer lower price and offset those loss across other part of it ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecur firm could still surviveMicrosoft' grow interest in the cybersecur market could render some smaller player obsolete, but ""best in breed"" player like FireEy and Palo Alto have surviv similar assault from bundl player before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, ha aggress bundl threat prevent and next-gen firewal into it network hardwar and software. Yet FireEy still serv 5,000 custom across 67 countries, which includ nearli half of the Forb Global 2000. Palo Alto serv over 35,500 custom in more than 140 countries, includ 80 of the Fortun 100 and half of the Global 2000.Those number indic that compani will like valu a company' track record and reput over the conveni of cheaper bundles. They also indic that it could be smarter for Microsoft to either acquir or partner with smaller stand-alon player instead of tri to render them obsolete.Th key takeawayBeef up it cybersecur busi will help Microsoft counter Amazon and tighten up it ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While some of the new featur seem destin to crush third-parti secur players, investor should rememb that compani will like stick with ""best in breed"" player instead of the cheapest bundle, and a mass switch to a new secur platform can be costli and time consuming.Therefore, investor in cybersecur compani should be mind of Microsoft' ambitions, but they should rememb that mani ""best in breed"" compani have weather similar attack from compani like Cisco before.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announc HomeKit - it strategi for becom the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) reveal it Alexa-pow Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhil there are current sever dozen HomeKit compat smart home products, Amazon' Alexa is now connect to thousand of smart product and servic and ha spread from the Echo to third-parti devices.On the surface, it look as though Amazon ha outmaneuv and thoroughli trounc Apple. But despit the seemingli insurmount lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beat AMZN in thi smart home race.Here' how.Appl Chose the Close Approach With HomeKitAppl tend to be extrem cautious. It softwar is design to be user-friendli and secure. iPhon app can't just be download from anywhere; they need to go through the offici App Store and that requir approv by AAPL. Third-parti hardwar need to be certifi by Appl befor it can be market as be iOS-compatible.It' that ""walled"" approach that hasmad the iPhon more securethan smartphon runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android oper system.With the iPhon and Siri - Apple' voic assist - at the center of Apple' smart home strategy, that focu on security, compat and eas of use carri over toHomeKit. Manufactur who want to make their smart devic HomeKit-compat face a daunt seri of requirements.Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Ha a New Hero: Services!A point out in a recent Reuter articl ondiff smart home approaches, thi includ be forc to buy a special HomeKit chip, be limit to approv (and more expens than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip and even extend to manufactur be limit to factori that are certifi by Apple. End-to-end encrypt is mandatory. Onc a HomeKit product is ready, it face extens test by Appl engin to ensur compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alon can take three to five months.So you have addit costs, the procedur red tape and a delay. It' easi to understand whyAppl current list onli 75 or so HomeKit-compat devices. And half of those are either differ color option or region variat of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radic differ approach with it Echo speaker and Alexa. The compani openli court third-parti compani to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-en interact with an Amazon Alexa-pow device.A skill can be the abil to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be tell Alexa to turn on your home' smart light or to start your electr car. The process is simple. Amazon provid an exampl showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includ the time need to creat a develop account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it' published.That' how Amazon Alexa tripl it avail skill in just three month last year, hit 3,000 in September. If that sound impressive, by CE 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addit to skills, Amazon also encourag third parti to integr Alexa function into their products. That way, consum get the Alexa experi without requir an Echo speaker.That' a far easier process than Appl HomeKit certification. A ""Work with Alexa"" label take about 10 day to obtain (it can even be issu by third parti labs) and doesn't requir special chips. Accord to the Reuter post, that ha result in over 250 product that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, includ third-parti speaker with Alexa and even home applianc with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Appl Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityTh differ approach of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidli leap to a massiv lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where thi could chang rapidly.Secur is increasingli becom an issu for smart, connect devices. Apple' HomeKit approach emphas security, to the point of forc the use of special chip and even certifi manufactur facilities.Amazon' Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leav it platform rel exposed. Amazon told Reuter it can't guarante the secur of third-parti devic run Alexa. Those thousand of Alexa skill also integr with third-parti servic that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trad of the Day: Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAl it would take is one catastroph hack for a PR disast that turn consum off Alexa. As CNET put it in a review of thehack risk for differ smart home standards: ""Don't assum that a devic ha high secur standard just becaus it work with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere' no disput the fact that Amazon complet caught Appl and other off guard with it stealthi approach of sneak Alexa into the home use it Echo connect speaker.Befor the Echo, it wa gener assum that a smartphon would be the natur smart home controller. Make Alexa integr so open ha also paid off for AMZN, result in a formid lead in the smart home in a veri short time. That lead may well turn into complet domin of the connect home. But Amazon' open approach may also prove to be it Achil heel.Should hacker turn their attent to Amazon Alexa, the result headlin may flip the equat and put the much more secur Appl HomeKit on top in the long run.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularli give your opinion on someth as unpredict as financi markets, gloat when you get someth right is rare a good idea. That is especi true when those opinion arearchivedfor all to see; it' too easi for a reader to check out that archiv and find exampl of when the market and hindsight combin to make even logic argument seem foolish. I am fulli awar of that, but when it come to yesterday’searn releas from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What realli matter about the Appl releas to investor is certainli not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant return to growth in revenu for the first time in a year, nor that the alreadi great margin at Appl increased. Those last two are important, but necessarili backward looking, as all hard data in an earn releas are by definition.What matter most is what the report tell us about the futur and there the messag wa somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();Th offici guidanc for Q1 2017 contain in the releas fell just short of Wall Street’ expectations, which would normal be enough of a neg to more than offset the good histor results. In thi case, though, a look at where Appl succeed in Q4 2016 suggest that that guidanc may just be anoth exampl of Apple’ past tendenc to err on the side of under-promis and over-deliv when it come to guidance. That is why, even though growth stall last year, AAPL ha beaten EP expect in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhon sale hit anoth record. That is particularli signific as not that long ago mani were predict that Googl parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’ move into the phone busi would do Appl some seriou harm. It look now as if those say that were about as accur as those that maintain that the Window phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.Th fact is that the iPhon ha an icon statu that look almost imposs to challenge. Even phone that are object better in some ways, such as memori capacity, camera resolution, or speaker qualiti for example, cannot take market share. As Appl advanc the iPhon with each release, beat them on those and other front becom harder, but remains, accord to the evid so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynam remains, hold Appl stock and ad to hold at time of weak still make sens for investors.Th weak in thi releas wa mainli in one area; iPad sale declin for the twelfth success quarter. That, however, wa offset to some extent by strong sale of Mac and Appl Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Appl doesn’t releas a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I point out in the articl referenc above, anybodi who tri to buy a Seri Two watch as a Christma gift is probabl awar that sale were at least more than Appl expected. None were avail in ani of the five state where I tri and most store have just now receiv inventory.That shortag of watches, combin with Cook’ admiss that they serious underestim demand for the iPhon 7 Plus, mean that the record sale report yesterday were achiev with a background of suppli constraints. Given that and the fact that there wa consider growth in area such as servic and enterpris oper that still have lot of room for Appl to expand, the messag underli yesterday’ earn is that, despit convent wisdom, growth can still be achieved."
Here's How Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon Stack Up on Free Shipping;2/1/2017;"Earlier thi week,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) tri to jump-start it onlin busi by drop it $50 annual fee for free two-day shipping, replac it with an offer of free two-day ship on ani order over $35.

Imag source: Wal-Mart.What doe each compani offer?Al three major retail offer some sort of free shipping. Here' a look at the standard offer from Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon. (Target and Wal-Mart have offer differ holiday deal some years.)Wal-Mart: As note above, the compani now offer free, two-day ship on ani order over $35.Target: The retail actual ha a lower free-ship threshold at $25, but it offer ""standard shipping,"" which take 3-5 busi days. The compani also offer free standard ship on ani Target.com order paid for with it REDcard credit or debit card, though not everi item is eligible.Amazon: The onlin retail clearli want peopl to join Prime as it free ship offer for those not in Prime requir purchas of either $25 in book or $49 of elig item that are ""deliv 5-8 busi day after all of your item are avail to ship, includ pre-ord items,"" accord to a compani webpage.If you can wait for your items, Target offer a better deal for smaller orders, but the differ between $25 and $35 is gener a question of ad an item or two. Target arguabl ha a high-qual free ship offer to REDcard holders, albeit a slow one. Wal-Mart, however, clearli ha the best overal free ship deal with no membership requir if you combin order minimum and speed of delivery.Can Wal-Mart catch Amazon?Lor deserv credit for think like a start-up executive. Wal-Mart simpli wa not go to get mass buy-in to a $50-a-year free two-day ship membership program when Amazon Prime alreadi ha an estim 65 million U.S. members. Those consum are especi loyal to Amazon, estim to spend on averag about $1,200 per year, compar to about $600 per year for non-memb customer.It' hard to pictur massiv number of Amazon shopper drop Prime and jump to Wal-Mart. Some value-consci custom might, but it' like to be a small amount. Had Wal-Mart made thi offer befor Amazon had sign up around half the household in the U.S. for Prime, then perhap the result would be different.Still, while it won't caus an immedi shift in consum behavior, Wal-Mart' offer should jump-start it e-commerc efforts. Lore ha creat a deal which might tempt peopl who rare shop onlin and it should make Amazon custom more will to buy on Walmart.com when that site ha the item they want or a better price.It' a long race and Amazon ha a realli big lead, but think like a start-up should help Wal-Mart make up some ground.

GoPro (GPRO) Q4 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?;2/1/2017;"GoPro, Inc.GPROi slate to report fourth-quart 2016 results, after the close bell on Feb 2.The compani ha had a bleak earn history, have miss estim thrice in the trail four quarters, for an averag neg surpris of 26.9%. Last quarter, GoPro lag estim by 29.6%.Let' see how thing are shape up for thi announcement.Factor to ConsiderA lot of thing have gone wrong in the fourth quarter for GoPro. The compani wa forc to announc a recal of it new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of it commerci launch, as a few of them lost power dure flight due to batteri issues.Th ground of GoPro' drone dream follow multipl oper stumbles, includ mess up launches, product delay and miss deadlin in the recent past.Karma' success wa consid an integr part of GoPro' return to growth, along with the Hero5 cameras. In fact, the compani had been hope that Karma would prove to be a hit dure the holiday season, have just gone to market on Oct 23. Now, with Karma temporarili out of the pictur in the all-import holiday season, we believ that there might be reason to expect that GoPro' fourth quarter might just be no better than it third.In fact, in it third-quart report, the compani had also reduc it sale target for the year, in light of weak expect from the season strong fourth quarter. Thi spook investor as the compani had earlier anticip to gener nearli half of it revenu for 2016 in the holiday season. The guidanc for revenu for 2016 wa lower to the rang of $1.25-$1.3 billion (previou guidance: $1.35-$1.5 billion).GoPro also face stiff competit dure the holiday season, especi from Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNEcho products. Thi will also like affect the fourth-quart revenues.At one point, the compani wa unabl to meet the project demand of it new action camera due to intern issu and a compromis product ramp. We expect delay shipment owe to product and suppli chain concern to hurt revenu in the quarter under review as well.Further, analyst have becom increasingli bearish on the stock lately, with the company' estim move south over the past month. The Zack Consensu Estim for 2016 earn ha widen from a loss of $1.97 to a loss of $1.99 per share in the past month, thank to three downward revis compar with none upward.Unsurprisingly, GoPro' stock ha had a dismal run on the bours - have record an averag return of just 5% over the past one year, compar with the Zack categorizedAudio/Video Home Productsindustry' 33.6%.Howev big the issu it faces, GoPro still boast an enviabl retail presence. Extrem few consum technolog compani have the kind of retail presenc that GoPro ha and thi might work in favor of the company.GoPro remain optimist about the success of it hardwar launch in 2016 and said it forese return to profit in fourth-quart 2016. For the to-be-report quarter, the compani anticip to gener non-GAAP dilut earn per share of 30 cent (+/- 5 cents), on revenu of $625 million (+/- $25 million).Thi would be the first quarter to display the perform of GoPro' first signific updat to it flagship line of action camera in two year - the new Hero5 Black camera and the smaller, cube-shap Hero5 Session. The Hero5 Black is arguabl one of the best action cameras, currently, in the market and ha receiv rave reviews.In fact, accord to the Pacif Crest analysts, the compani look to have sold more camera than expect dure the recent holiday season, which should reflect well in the upcom results. We believ that the new product and softwar updat will provid a much need boost to GoPro' top line.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensu and EP Surprise|GoPro, Inc.

Is Voice Search an Opportunity or a Threat to Google?;1/31/2017;"Imag source: Google.Consum are do more and more web search just by talking. And they'r not just ask the digit assist on their smartphones; they'r also buy all-new devices, such as theAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Googl Home, to answer random queries.makeArticleAd();For Google, the subsidiari ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a double-edg sword. On one hand, it provid anoth point for user to interact with it product. On the other, Googl doesn't have a stranglehold on the devic market, and it isn't clear how compani can monet voic search with ads.Even as Googl navig the shift to mobile, it still fundament follow the same busi model -- display ad within search results. That' not possibl with voic searches.But Googl CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more opportun than challenge, when I think about voic search,"" he told analyst on the company' fourth-quart earn call. I wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.Los the hardwar battleGoogl didn't provid ani exact figur on the sale of it new Googl Home device. Pichai did say that ""Googl Home wa a veri popular present that mani peopl open on Christma morning,"" but that wa as detail as he got.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggest that Googl is get outsold 10-to-1 by competitor such as Amazon Echo. That present a real challeng for Google, becaus without control over the hardware, it ha no control over the user interface. That mean all those potenti voic search will go to someon else.Pichai point out that it' the veri earli day for devic such as Googl Home. And Googl doe have one big advantag over Amazon and other competitor -- it' much better at search. ""When I look at what it would take to voic search well, our year of progress we have done in area like natur languag process come into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To hi credit, Googl Home ha outperform Alexain manyhead-to-head searchreviews.But smart-speak hardwar is about more than search, and Amazon' Echo is capabl of integr with more devic and servic than Googl Home is. Googl is certainli capabl of overcom that through more strateg partnerships, though. It just releas a develop kit for busi to integr with Googl Home last month.On area that will be harder to overcom is how well Amazon Echo work for Amazon Prime members. With ten of million of Prime member around the world, it creat a pretti big moat for Googl Home to cross.But wait -- it get tougherEven if Googl close the gap in hardwar sales, it still ha to find a way to turn voic search into a business. Hardwar sale won't move the needl for Alphabet, which gener over $90 billion in revenu last year.What' more, Googl ha to sell the hardwar near cost becaus it biggest competitor, Amazon, doe the same. The margin on a Googl Home devic don't even come close to Google' 31% oper margin in the fourth quarter.If Googl is go to make some real money off of voic search, it need to go beyond just get it devic into people' homes. Google' best idea so far is tofacilit commerc through voic search. But if there' one compani that ha Google' number in e-commerc search, it' Amazon. Googl will not win a battl against Amazon in develop a person shop assistant, no matter how good it search capabl are.Not just a challeng -- a threatTh growth of voic isn't just a challeng for Google. The shift to voic repres a threat, as it could result in a declin in the amount consum use Googl search, the company' cash cow.Googl is work to overcom the head start Amazon got in smart speakers, which acceler the voic search trend. It plan to expand it hardwar lineup and invest more in 2017. But as voic search continu grow and start take search away from mobil and desktop, it will put pressur on Googl to continu develop new higher-valu display and search ad for it main desktop and mobil products.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Offers Up More Free Profits!;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIf you'v read me for a while, you know that I have my concern about the battl between the long-term prospect ofNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) versu the outrag valuat of NFLX stock. My biggest worri is that eventually,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will sever pressur Netflix' P&L.makeArticleAd();But, for the short term, I think it' easier to trade Netflix' price action than it is the fundamentals.First, we have an uber-bullish equiti market. Add to that the cult follow in Netflix stock, and you have someth that need a big reason to break down. Unless we get a gener market correction, we don't have an environ conduc to NFLX falter in a big way.Click to EnlargeTechnically, I like the way NFLX stock is behaving. It' set higher high and knock on roofs. It alreadi blew through my recent set targets, but I don't think it' too late to squeez out anoth bullish trade.I will submit that the fundament argument over the valu of NFLX stock is debatable. So I revert to the technic aspect. Recent I wrote abouthow to reap free profit from trade Netflix. That trade is still in play, but I feel like I need to skew my posit to more long than short. So I can reset anoth trade to help me achiev just that.How to Trade NFLX Stock Right NowTh bet:Sel the NFLX Sep $100 put for $3.50 per contract. Thi trade ha a 90% theoret chanc of success with a 30% buffer from current price. My breakeven price is $96.5 per share.3 Stock to Buy for Better Deal Than the Great RecessionIf Netflix stay abov $100 through September, then someon bought a lose lotto ticket from me and I get to keep the premium. If NFLX stock fall below $100 while the posit is open, then I could be put the stock. I start to accru loss below $96.50 per share.I onli sell nake put if I am will and abl to own the stock at the strike sold. In thi case, and if I am assign the stock at $100 per share, it would mean that I bought Netflix stock at a 30% discount from today' prices.Sel nake put is not suitabl for all risk profil or account sizes. I could chang the trade to be a sold put spread (also call a bull put spread) to better suit more traders.Th alternate:Sel a NFLX Sep $100/$95 credit put spread for 75 cent per contract. But in thi case, my max loss is finite, so margin requir is fixed. The trade still ha a 90% theoret chanc of success with a 16% potenti yield as a reward. NFLX would still need to fall 30% to reach my sold risk level.2 Way to Trade Facebook Inc (FB) Stock After EarningsI did mention that NFLX is look friski from the technic perspective. So someon who want to captur that potenti can alloc some of the premium collect for sell the put to buy a bullish call position. Thi can be done with a March debit call spread at $140 for a chanc to doubl your money.Personally, I will opt out becaus I want to tradeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and AMZN. I don't want to be too heavi on the mega-cap tech.I am not requir to hold ani option posit open through expiration. I can close ani of them for partial gain or losses.Nicola Chahin is the manag director ofSellSpreads.com. As of thi writing, he did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsEven ifAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest compani in the world (a measur by market cap), it quarterli earn report would still arguabl be the most-watch report for ani given earn seasons. Not onli are a wide swath of mani other compani link to Apple' success, but AAPL stock itself is someth of a baromet for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterli earn announc have also rais questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania ha run it course. The growth pace ha been undeni taper off.That' go to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Appl earn report for it fiscal first quarter is due.Appl Earn PreviewA of the most recent look, Appl isexpect to post earn of $3.22 per shareon revenu of $77.42 billion for the quarter end in December. The compani itself had guid for Q1 revenu of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock report for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year' first fiscal quarter talli of $75.87 billion.Appl need a strong show on Tuesday. Although it ha been a strong growth machin sinc unveil the first iPhon a littl over a decad ago, per-shar profit have been lower on a year-over-year basi in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatAAPL stock investor have been patient thu far, give CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a matur market. A shortfal and/or anoth quarter of shrink numbers, however, may push those traders' patienc over the edge.3 Thing to Watch for AAPLNot that Appl doesn't have a myriad of thing go on at ani given time, but for the most part, investor tend to focu on what they perceiv as the biggest three. The three item that will be do most of the drive for AAPL stock after Tuesday' report are (in no particular order)…iPhon 7 salesIt' the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sale of the company' flagship devic can cure all other ills, but if sale of the company' most recent iter of the iPhon fall short, littl els matters.Expect are wide vari on thi front too. Cowen & Co.think Appl sold 58.5 million unit of the iPhon 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believ Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhon 7 - dure it fiscal Q1. The overal consensus, though, isan averag of 77.3 million units. Presum most of those are the 7 and 7 Plu models.App and Digit ContentWhil Appl use to be a hardwar compani that also happen to facilit the purchas of smartphon apps, music and video media, digit content is increasingli becomingan import part of the revenu mixa satur becom a real issue.Th compani doesn't offer much in the way of expect for how it revenu break down, but we do know that in the previou quarter, Appl enjoy revenu of $6.3 billion for it ""Services"" division, which is mostli made up of it video, audio and app arms. That wa a 24% year-over-year improvement. That make it thesecond-biggest categori of product for Apple, though it' still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Tim High or New Problems?AAPL is even mull the creation ofit own origin televis show and movies, follow in the footstep of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remain to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discuss within the Appl earn report and confer call. Mayb it won't come up at all, but there' no deni AAPL is one of the more vulner compani to Presid Donald Trump' polici plans.Not onli might a strict foreign worker and immigr polici limit Apple' access to technic talent, but much-discuss tariff on Chinese-mad import could start a trade war that leav Appl right in the middl of it. Not onli doe Appl sell product to Chines consumers, it reli on China to make mani of the iPhone' key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trail P/E of 14.5, Appl share are price fairli … mayb even undervalued. That' apt to be a larg part of the reason the pro are collect rate AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (lean toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspici in light of the lacklust result we'v seen for the prior three quarters. Appl is go to have to outperform most expect if the stock' to build ani further on the 34% gain it ha muster sinc May of last year.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stock Ripe For A Short SqueezeTh post3 Thing Appl Inc.

3 Reasons Amazon.com Is Taking Over the World;1/30/2017;"If you'r wonder what the best stock of the past 20 year is, there' a far-and-away winner.Imag source: The Motley FoolmakeArticleAd();Accord to data from YCharts,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock ha increas more than 42,000% sinc it IPO 20 year ago, in May 1997.AMZNdata byYChartsIn other words, $1,000 invest at that time would today be worth more than $420,000. Amazon' market valu at the time of the IPO, which wa $300 million, ha grown by more than 1,000 time as the compani is now worth nearli $400 billion. Share dilut ha made the increas in the individu share valu less.What' amaz about Amazon is that even as it' becom one of the five most valuabl compani in the country, the compani continu to grow at a breakneck rate. Analyst are expect revenu to have increas 28% in 2016 when the compani report full-year earn on Feb. 2, and for earn per share to have grown nearli fourfold from a year ago, thank to blockbust growth at it cloud comput division.With that kind of momentum and the popular of program like it Prime membership service, it seem like that Amazon will becom the most valuabl compani in the world in the next decade. Here are three reason for that outlook.Invent, invent, inventNo compani ha put a greater emphasi on invent in the past two decades. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezo ha credit the company' success on the three big ideas: Put the custom first. Invent. And be patient.Amazon ha been at the forefront of a vast rang of emerg industri sinc it inception, includ e-commerce, e-read and e-books, cloud computing, video streaming, digit technolog such as Alexa, and even drone delivery.Amazon' cultur encourag invention, risk-tak and failure, and that cultur seem to be the biggest driver of it success. The company' recent open of it Amazon Go store offer a perfect example. Use a network of camera and other advanc technolog similar to self-driv cars, the conveni allow custom to select item and simpli walk out of the store with them. There is no checkout process. Amazon just charg custom automat through a smartphon app. The compani spent four year work on the technology, and it willing to make those kind of sacrific have enabl it to gain such market power. The company' emphasi on make thing easier for the custom and develop new technolog is what' made it such a power disruptor across so mani industries.Cutthroat competitivenessA more-hidden aspect of Amazon' uniqu cultur may be the company' extrem competitiveness. Bezo ha repeatedli issu broadsid to rival such as ""Your margin is my opportunity"" and oper with breakeven margin for 20 year as the compani built out scale. While most busi seek out profit to satisfi shareholders, Bezo ha alway been content to play the long game, promis investor from day one that he wa build a compani for the long term, and it' paid off.A much-read 2015New York Timesexpos describ Amazon as a brutal workplac where much is demand of employe whose idea are sternli challeng and even belittled. But even the harsh workplac environ may contribut to the company' strength.Th compani ha often elbow out smaller competitor by use monopolist tactics. When Quidsi' Diapers.com began take signific market share from Amazon, the e-commerc leader respond by lower diaper price by a third, bleed Quidsi until it sold itself to Amazon.In book publishing, Amazon got involv in a lawsuit when it refus to abid by a publisher' prices, with the publish insist the price were necessari to give author adequ incent and keep the industri aliv and profitable. Amazon want to charg $10 for most e-book and went as far as essenti refus to sell 5,000 titl from Hachette, delay shipment by week for no reason other than to punish the publish for not cooperating. Amazon eventu cave in to the publish houses, agre to their price model, but it still maintain monopoly-lik control over the booksel industry.Competit advantagesCompl Amazon' invent and it ultra-competitv is the company' network of competit advantages. Amazon ha a built a reput as a low-cost provider, although recent studi have shown that the compani is most competit on price on onli the most popular products.Regardless, Amazon ha gain the trust of mani of it customers, especi Prime member who go directli to Amazon when they need to order someth online. Prime ha encourag Amazon shopper to spend doubl what they use to on the websit and encourag member to particip in other part of Amazon' ecosystem, such as video stream and Kindl books.But not all of Amazon' competit advantag are customer-facing. The company' Marketplac and Fulfil by Amazon have made the websit the most popular home for third-parti vendors. That add anoth revenu stream for Amazon and in turn make it the more appeal for custom as it increas it product range.Finally, Amazon' reput with custom allow it to easili enter new industri as it did when it launch Home Services, offer servic such as hous clean or furnitur assembl through third-parti vendors.A Amazon continu to build out new fulfil center and unveil technolog like Amazon Go and Alexa, it competit advantag are like to increase. Consid the vast major of retail spend still take place off line, Amazon ha a long growth path ahead.Expect the compani to keep disrupt industri far and wide over the next decad as it continu it quest to take over the world.Find out whi Amazon.comi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Together, these three activ constitut 51% of total employ and $2.7 trillion in wages.T 1 - US: Time Spent on Automat ActivitiesSource: McKinsey Global Institute,A Futur That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityMGI then look at the autom potenti for more than 2,000 work activities. It reduc thi down to 19 industri sector for the US economy. It then broaden the analysi to the global economy. The result from thi exercis are summar in Tabl 2.Tabl 2 - Autom Potenti for 19 SectorsSource: McKinsey Global Institute,A Futur That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityOf course, it is easi to second-guess MGI' estimates. For example, I believ a far greater share of educ activ than 27% can be automated. Why? Becaus a good deal of educ occur via lectures, and definit there are better and wors lecturers. In light of this, whi not get the best lectur on all topic and provid them digit to classrooms? Classroom teacher would then onli have to discuss and answer question on the lectures. Of course, such an action would be vigor resist by the teachers' unions.And to that point, MGI argu there are five key factor that will influenc the pace and extent of automation:Techn feasibility, sinc the technolog ha to be invented, integr and adapted;Th cost of develop and deploy solutions, which affect the busi case for adoption;Labor market dynamics, includ the supply, demand, and cost of human labor as an altern to autom (see educ discuss above);Th econom benefits, which could includ higher throughput and increas quality, as well as labor cost savings.Regulatori and social accept will affect the rate of adopt even when deploy make busi sense.MGI believ that when all of these factor into account, it will take decad for automation' effect on current work activ to play out fully.Demographics, Product Growth and Labor Forc AdjustmentsOv the last four decades, product gain have been labor-saving. In fact, these gain have wipe out a huge number of middl class jobs. However, if we look out over a longer time frame, the pictur is somewhat different. Econom growth is constrain by the labor suppli and it productivity. We know that for most develop countries, popul and as a consequence, labor suppli are falling. That mean that econom growth depend exclus on product growth. For most develop countries, econom growth will benefit from both rise popul and grow productivity. MGI point out:""…peak employ will occur in most countri within 50 years. The expect declin in the share of the working-ag popul will open an econom growth gap: roughli half of the sourc of econom growth from the past half centuri (employ growth) will evapor as popul age. Even at histor rate of product growth, econom growth could be nearli halved. Autom could compens for at least some of these demograph trends. We estim the product inject it could give to the global economi as be between 0.8 and 1.4 percent of global GDP annually, assum that human labor replac by autom would rejoin the workforc and be as product as it wa in 2014. Consid the labor substitut effect alone, we calcul that, by 2065, autom could potenti add product growth in the largest economi in the world (G19 plu Nigeria) that is the equival of an addit 1.1 billion to 2.3 billion full-tim workers.""T 3 provid MGI' estim of the full-tim equival (FTE) GDP gap in 2065 of assum today' product and current popul project and today' GDP/FTE. So, for example, the US GDP/FTE would be 4% less than it is now becaus of the labor forc decline. MGI conclud for develop nations:""Autom can provid the product boost requir to meet econom growth project that they otherwis would struggl to attain without other signific product growth accelerators. These economi thu have a major interest in pursu rapid autom adoption.""T 3 - FTE Gap Between FTE Project and Number of FTE Need to Maintain GDP per Capita as Percent FTE in 2014Source: McKinsey Global Institute,A Futur That Works: Automation, Employment, and ProductivityWhil thi is an interest exercise, I remain far more concern about labor suppli surpluses, result from acceler labor-sav autom than slower econom growth result from labor suppli shortages.Invest - Who Produc Autom Equipment?Autom is clearli acceler so it is reason to ask who the produc are. A list is provid in Tabl 4. Mani of the compani have been around for a long time and get into autom is an evolut from their main focus. Exampl includ Amazon (AMZN), Boe (BA), Honda (HMC), Hyundai (HYMLF), Kawasaki (KWHIY), Lockhe (LMT), Samsung (SSNNF) and Toyota (TM).

A rel larg number of these firm are Japanese.T 4 - Lead Autom ""Producers""Source:Robot Busi ReviewI answer thi with a quot from Peter Lynch. Peter Lynch' track record wa truli remarkable. As I havenot elsewhere, he beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 12 of the 14 year he ran Fidelity' Magellan Fund (FMAGX). And on average, if the S&P gain 5%, Magellan gain 22.5%! Even in the two year the S&P outperform Lynch, the spread wa veri small. Lynch argu you should:""Us your special knowledg to home in on stock you can analyze, studi them and then decid if they'r worth owning.

If we see thi trend continu in the come day as the rest of Q4 report come in, then it would mean that estim like hadn't drop enough ahead of the start of thi earn season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher thi time around rel to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earn season scorecard, we now have result from 171 S&P 500 member that have report as of Januari 30th.

But recov it ha - FB stock is up roughli 15% in the past month to trade near all-tim high around $113.So, what' in store for Facebook thi time around?If you believ Jefferi analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sit on the powder keg that send Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believ Instagram and mobil ad revenu will drive the busi forward, and expect Q4 revenu to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightli ahead of Wall Street' broader estim for $8.5 billion. He also project GAAP profit of $1.05, which are a penni higher than the consensu mark.""W remain particularli optimist around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad unit like DPAs, and Live video,"" say Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target repres 33% upsid from here. ""While expens growth is a potenti concern, FB ha a histori of under-promis and overdeliv in thi area.""10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatIndeed, mobil is king for Facebook, which cross the 1 billion mark for ""mobil only"" activ user in Q3.

At about $5.7 billion, mobil ad sale came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sale in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook match Wall Street' project for 45.6% sale growth, that would be down both sequenti from Q3' 59% revenu expansion, and last Q4' 52% increas in sales.

However, if one believ that iPhon unit can grow with iPhon 8 and then be roughli stabl go forward, we believ Servic and App will becom the growth engin for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Reclaim Its Throne;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) ha it day of reckon fast approaching. Tim Cook ha turn out to be a game manag for AAPL stock. That' not a slight against him, but a game manag come in when your first-str QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Appl need a visionary. There' no replac Steve Jobs, and be a game manag in a sector that move like lightn is not what the compani needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock gener almost 70% of revenu from the iPhone, and that product is see increas competition.Th good news is that Appl ha well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can liter do anyth it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck oversea - although that may chang under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Appl would probabl have to make acquisit in rapidli grow companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can ventur into, one that I'v been say it must get into: origin content.7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 2018New ha surfac that AAPL is final look serious at creat origin TV and film content. For years, Appl ha beg off of thi direction. It seem content to play around with music streaming, and licens content from other provid for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""Th technolog giant ha been in talk with veteran produc in recent month about buy right to script televis programs. It also ha approach experienc market execut at studio and network to discuss hire them to promot it content, said peopl with knowledg of the discussions. In addit to TV, Appl indic to these peopl that it is consid offer origin movies, though those plan are more preliminary. Execut at Appl have told peopl in Hollywood they hope to start offer origin script content by the end of 2017.""The appl is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a veri big way. We'v seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) ha shift it model toward origin program and is produc realli great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTub Red, though, is kind of flounder right now.On thing peopl want is not onli more content, but good content. Becaus Appl is so flush with cash, it can liter do anyth in thi arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so mani model to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Appl would want to creat high qualiti TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issu of stream content alone. If Appl wanted, it could produc featur films, and buy out ani of the exist movi theatr chain and rebrand it as an Appl Theatr experience, and drop in all manner of synergi like this.Th concept of the ""long tail"" is still veri much in play, so creat independ work for a price, or return to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mine new talent from film school and user-gener geniu that' all over the place.Th emerg technolog of VR is anoth place to stretch. The abil to curat fulli engag experi via VR, and develop technolog that allow player to wear bodysuit permit them to actual experi touch in these game is the next frontier.Can Appl Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?And Appl ha the money for it. It could becom a multi-platform creator of content, and be abl to engag peopl from all over the world.I thi is a blockbust revenu gener for Appl stock? It' way too earli to tell. However, have a vision that extend the concept of ""content"" to thing like VR and more ""experiential"" content, could mean becom the first mover in a whole new gener of entertainment. That is priceless.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter. As of thi writing, ha no posit in ani stock mentioned.

How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After Earnings;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is schedul to report it latest batch of earn on Thursday, Feb. 2, after the close of trading. Look at through a multimonth lens, AMZN stock ha larg done noth sinc last October, though it ha seen some gyrat within thi time frame.makeArticleAd();To be better prepar for Amazon earnings, and for perspective, here is my battl plan for AMZN follow the report.Lik I alway say, ""gambling"" on a stock through it earn announc in hope of a certain outcom (a ralli or a selloff) is on averag a low-prob bet. Even in the best-cas scenario, thi ha a 50/50 chanc of success.Regardless of how good or bad a company' outlook, earnings, sale or other metric is, the immediate- to near-term direct of ani given stock follow earn ultim depend on what larg investor want to do with share after the report. Thi might sound oversimplistic, but I find that mani activ investor often lose sight of the fact that abov all, it' suppli and demand that dictat price direction. And suppli and demand don't alway correl ration with news flow.AMZN Stock ChartsLook at the multiyear weekli chart of Amazon, we see that the latest steep ralli sinc earli 2015 ha larg taken place within a well-defin up-trend channel similar to what we see in in other large-cap technolog growth stock such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB).Click to EnlargeNot how well the yellow 50-week simpl move averag ha held as support over the past coupl of year and how thi ha coincid with the lower end of the up-trend channel.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatFrom thi perspective, consid that AMZN stock tend to make big move follow it earn reports, share thi week might either gravit toward the upper end of the up-trend channel (toward $900) or retest the lower end of the channel around the low to mid-$700s.That might not sound like much insight. However, it give us a veri well-defin trade rang between $750 and $900.All els be equal, a ralli to the upper end of the rang would be a better opportun to sell or short the stock. A move to the lower end may provid better buy opportunities, follow a bullish reversal.Lastly, note the neg diverg between price and momentum over the past 12 months. The price of AMZN stock ha continu to rise, yet momentum - as repres by the MACD oscil at the bottom of the chart - is still point lower and make lower highs. Thi doe not bode well for much further upsid in the stock, and even a post-earn ralli may be better sold than chase higher.Here' Whi Netflix, Inc. Stock (NFLX) Will Trade At $270 By 2020On the daili chart, we see that the latest multiweek ralli in AMZN, after bounc off the 200-day move averag (red) in earli January, onc again ha the stock back at it Octob 2016 high near $840.Click to EnlargeAct trader could look to buy/chas AMZN stock higher if and when the stock can break and hold abov $850 on a daili close basi follow the earn report. From there, a next upsid target becom the aforement upper end of the trade channel around the $900 mark. Ani sudden bearish revers would be use as a stop-loss signal.Alternatively, if AMZN stock gap lower and sell off follow the earn report, a next downsid target in the mid-$750 come into focus.Lik what you see?

Costco Wholesale Corporation's Worst Move in 2016;1/28/2017;"Costco(NASDAQ: COST) continu to squander an opportun by oper as if the internet ha not becom a major factor in retail.Th compani ha proven resili in the face of digit competitor led byAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . While other retail are shutter stores, lose sales, and gener fight for survival, the warehous chain ha not had that problem.Costco had a decent fiscal 2016, with comparable-stor sale up 4% global and 3% in the Unit State when the impact of fall gasolin price is factor out. In addition, net incom for the year wa roughli the same as 2015, come in at $2.35 billion, or $5.33 per dilut share, compar to $2.38 billion, or $5.37 per dilut share last year.makeArticleAd();Thos number drop a littl in the first quarter of 2017, which cover the period end Novemb 20. Dure Q1, comparable-stor sale were up just 1% for the U.S., with the total compani post a 2% gain. Net income, however, came in a bit better, with the compani report $545 million, or $1.24 per dilut share, compar to $480 million, or $1.09 per dilut share, in Q1 of fiscal 2017.None of these result are spectacular, but in a challeng retail environment, they are acceptable. What' not seen in these numbers, though, is that by basic conduct busi as usual, Costco ha mostli pass up an opportun to grow it digit business.Costco valu get custom into it store over have them shop online. Imag source: author.What is Costco do wrong?A a membership-bas business, Costco make most of it profit (about 75%) by drive peopl to pay either $55 for a regular membership or $110 for a Gold Star membership, which come with 2% cash back on purchas at the chain' store or on it website. Onc peopl join, they onli save money if they actual shop at the chain, and those who shell out the extra $55 to be an Execut Member take that to heart.""Execut Member now account for a littl over a third of our base and a littl more than two-third of our sales, where Execut Member are offered,"" said CFO Richard Galanti dure the company' Q4 2016 earn call.That audience, a group that ha a willing to shop more at Costco, could easili be part of an expand digit push by the company. Instead, Costco larg ignor the internet in 2016.The warehous club hold onto member in part becaus they see valu in the chain' low price and it merchandis mix. Onlin sale could be use to extend both of those proposit while also ad conveni as an ad benefit. Costco doesn't appear to see that value, and rather than view digit as a way to take sale from competitors, it appear to look at online/app sale as give it custom a reason to not visit it stores.Galanti address the lack of digit focu dure the earn call. He acknowledg some issu with the company' website, but also impli that the compani doe not consid onlin sale a priority.""Y will see some differ and mostli the differ are from an offens standpoint, not a defens standpoint,"" he said.

How Risky Is The Procter & Gamble Company?;1/27/2017;"As a 179-year-old diversifi produc of household products,Proct & Gamble(NYSE: PG) is often regard as one of the most risk-fre stock on the market.It' a Dividend Aristocrat to boot, have rais it quarterli payout for 60 consecut years, and now offer a healthi dividend yield. Sell product like soap, laundri detergent, and razor that are as timeless now as they were a centuri ago, the compani seem to have a busi built to last.Imag source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();P&G may, therefore, look bulletproof -- but look can be deceiving.Longev is no guarante of futur success, as we were remind earlier thi month when Ringl Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circu said it would fold up it tent after 146 year in business. Pressur from anim right group forc the entertain to cut out eleph from it performances, and attend sunk without them. Digit entertain option that exist a gener ago like iPad andNetflixalso like hasten the circus' demise.Th Tide-mak may not be face such an existenti threat, but the competit landscap is chang in it industry. Here are a few of the risk investor should be on the lookout for.E-commerceTh internet ha upset the tradit order in retail. It' creat opportun for upstart brand such as eyewear-mak Warbi Parker to challeng entrench brick-and-mortar chains, and Procter & Gamble' biggest brand have also been affected.Razor-mak Gillett ha seen headi competit from onlin brand like Dollar Shave Club and Harry's. Dollar Shave Club' success led Gillett to roll out it own subscription-bas membership program, and Gillett even su Dollar Shave Club for patent infring in 2015. Launch in 2012, Dollar Shave Club help cut Gillette' North American market share from 71% to 59% in the interven yearsa the start-up built up a membership base of 3.2 million and wa bought byUnilever(NYSE: UL) for $1 billion last year.An even bigger threat to P&G may come fromAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , the great disrupt of thi era. Report emerg last year that the e-commerc giant would begin make it own private-label goods, includ diaper and laundri detergent. With ten of million of Prime member in it ecosystem, Amazon ha a ready-mad legion of trust custom that it could like cut off from P&G if it choos to make qualiti product and undercut it on price.A lack of innovationProct & Gambl wa onc a hallmark of American innovation, as it wa a pioneer of product like laundri detergent, fluoride-bas toothpaste, and dispos diapers, but it innov pipelin ha dri out in recent year as the compani ha spent a smaller proport of it revenu on R&D. It latest major invent wa the Swiffer, the floor-clean system with dispos pads, which it launch in 1999.The company' respons to Dollar Shave Club may best illustr it attitud toward innov these days. In 2014, Gillett releas the ProGlid FlexBal razor with a retail price start at $11.49, though it onli enhanc wa a track ball to guid the razor, and plan to spend $200 million market the new product.In other words, the bulk of the product' budget seem to go to marketing, rather than innovation. Gillett later creat it own shave club, but it respons to the start-up ha been gener weak. It could have just bought Dollar Shave Club, but the compani ha been so focus on shed brand that it may be miss opportunities.Slow growthPerhap as a consequ of e-commerc threats, a lack of innov and a stronger dollar, Procter & Gambl ha seen it growth slow significantli in recent years. In it most recent report, organ sale increas 2%, though investor sent the stock up as it rais it full-year organ sale guidanc from 2% to 2-3%.The stock' perform ha also been underwhelm in recent years, as the chart below shows.PGdata byYChartsA a defens stock, it' worth note that P&G may be more like to outperform the broader market dure a sell-off. Perhap more importantli for dividend investors, the company' dividend growth ha slow dramatically.Proct & Gambl Dividend HistoryCr line chartsIn the last two years, it hike it dividend by 3% and then just 1%. With a payout ratio of 73%, the compani ha some room to rais it dividend faster than that, but without signific increas in earn growth it will be hard for the compani to beat low-singl digit increases.Ultimately, what defin risk for an investor is the chanc of lose money on a given investment. With it solid dividend payout and stabl of diversifi brands, investor can probabl count on a modest return from P&G in the come years, but it recent underperform against theS&P 500i a lesson. Even for investor look for low-risk stocks, there are probabl better place to put your money.10 stock we like better than Procter and GambleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It may take an inordin amount of time for Gener Electr to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE return 6% last year - and we'v basic burn through two-third of that profit.I don't care how high the dividend yield are for Gener Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capit and justifi the loss due to the passiv income. Unless GE stock wa offer doubl digits, it' a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, whi are they offer doubl digits?Just Stay the Cours With Gener ElectricSo should potenti buyer heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock ha form an ""insid day"" pattern against the loss incur by the feebl earn report. Unless share can quickli fill the technic gap, momentum definit lean bearishly.

Is Netflix Inc. a Growth Stock or a Cult Stock?;1/25/2017;"I person like to invest in growth stocks, butNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ha alway seem too hot to handle. The stock' valuat never seem justifi by it earnings, yet it' ralli almost 900% over the past five years.Th bull usual call Netflix a ""growth"" stock, while mani bear call it a ""cult"" stock support by brand awar instead of fundament growth. Let' take a closer look at the stream giant' growth figur to see which label is better suit for the stream video leader.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Netflix.How fast is Netflix growing?Between fiscal 2011 and 2016, Netflix' annual revenu rose 175% from $3.2 billion to $8.8 billion. Dure those five years, it total stream subscrib worldwid climb from 23.5 million to 93.8 million as it pivot away from DVD-by-mail subscript and expand to oversea markets.Last quarter, Netflix' total subscrib base grew 25% annually, fuel by 10% growth in the U.S. and 48% growth overseas. That growth silenc critic who claim that Netflix' gradual increas in fee would caus it subscrib growth to peter out. The bull will like claim that Netflix' robust revenu and subscrib growth support it price-to-sal ratio of 6.8 -- which is more than doubl the industri averag of 3.3 for broadcast media companies.Thos number clearli indic that Netflix' ecosystem is growing, and explain whi it' becom synonym with stream video in mani markets. That' whi analyst expect Netflix' revenu to rise 27% thi year and anoth 20% next year. Meanwhile, Netflix' grow portfolio of acclaim origin show -- likeHous of Cards,Daredevil, andStrang Things-- are lock in subscrib and reduc it depend on pricey third-parti content.But what about the bottom line?Netflix' revenu and subscrib growth look solid, but it bottom line growth doesn't. Between 2011 and 2016, Netflix' net incom actual fell 17% from $226.1 million to $186.7 million due to the rise cost of licens third-parti content, the develop of it own multi-million dollar programs, and it aggress expans into oversea market with local content.Imag source: Netflix.But on the bright side, Netflix' oper margin ha improv over the past few quarters, rise from 3.3% to 6.2% between the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016. Netflix see higher revenu growth and reduc expens boost that figur to 9.1% for the current quarter. Base on these bottom line improvements, Netflix' net earn are expect to grow 158% thi year and 82% next year.Thos figur sound impressive, but they don't realli justifi the stock' trail P/E of 379. It forward P/E of 69 look less frothy, but it still indic that quit a bit of it futur growth is alreadi price in. Investor should also note that Netflix' heavi spend drop it free cash flow to neg $639 million at the end of the fourth quarter, compar to neg $276 million in the year ago quarter.Mind the disrupt headwindsNetflix ha been a disrupt forc over the past decade, first crush movi rental giant like Blockbust and then skewer tradit media, cable, and advertis compani by convinc their subscrib to ""cut their cords.""But look ahead, Netflix is head for head-on collis withTim Warner's(NYSE: TWX) HBO,Amazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video, and numer other stand-alon over-the-top (OTT) platforms. IfAT&T(NYSE: T) is clear to buy Time Warner, the telecom giant could exclud HBO Now and other stream content fromdata chargesacross it network -- which could forc Netflix to subsid it users' data cost or pay AT&T for ""zero-rated"" content.Meanwhile, Amazon ha aggress expand Prime Video with origin content to counter Netflix, bundl the platform into it prisoner-tak Prime memberships, and even offer stand-alon video subscript at lower price than Netflix. Amazon Video ha alreadi becom the third largest stream video servic in North America after Netflix and YouTub accord to research firm Sandvin -- so it' certainli well-pois to hurt the stream leader.So is Netflix a growth stock or a cult stock?I use to consid Netflix a cult stock, but I don't think the label is accur anymor consid the stabil of it subscrib and revenu growth and it improv margins. Netflix still look pricey rel to it trail 12 month earnings, but it stabil bottom line growth indic that it' not that expens rel to it futur earn growth potential.Netflix is certainli a riski stock, and competit move by Time Warner, AT&T, and Amazon could sink it. But it' still a growth play which could ralli even higher as it lock in even more user worldwid with well-receiv origin show and movies.Find out whi Netflixi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Why My Visit to Amazon Books was Eye-Opening;1/25/2017;"When my wife said she want to take a long-await pilgrimag to a bookstore, I thought it would be a perfect opportun to check outAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) recent open Amazon Book concept in San Diego. Base on my previou bookstor experiences, I expect a sprawl big-box bookstor pack with ten of thousand of book cram into everi avail shelf space, like sardines. What I found wa a small, unassum locat with onli a few thousand titles, with space for everi book. I also found opportun to join the Amazon ecosystem at everi turn.makeArticleAd();Th Amazon Book at the Westfield UTC Mall in La Jolla. Imag source: Author.A bookstoreIt' been quit some time sinc my last visit to a bookstore. Year back, my famili and I would go to the Border near our home everi few months. We would brows the seemingli endless suppli of book that line it shelv from floor to ceiling, as well as other section contain a varieti of newspapers, music, and movies.Custom are encourag to join Amazon Prime. Imag source: Author.Amazon Book wa quit different. There were no movi or music. There were wide aisl without crowding, and while there were plenti of books, there were far fewer than I had imagined.Onli the most popular titl could be found. They were arrang with the cover face up so that you could see each one. Though not the most effici use of space, it made brows a much less complic experience. If a specif titl wa not available, custom were remind that it could like be purchas on Amazon' website.And so much moreWhat wa most surpris wa the wide varieti of Amazon devic in the store. These includ Fire Tablets, Kindl e-readers, and Fire TV Stick. The Echo and Echo Dot, Amazon' interact speaker system with theAlexa virtual assistant, were featur prominently. Placard illustr peopl use numer Alexa command hung between them: ""Alexa, shuffl my workout playlist"" and ""Alexa, find me a Chines restaurant"" were two such examples.Sever of each of the devic were mount on stand for hands-on custom interaction. Amazon Basic electron accessories, as well as partner product that integr with Alexa, were available. Thi area cover approxim 25% of the store.Kindl and Echo displays. Imag source: Author.On employe that I spoke to indic that thi wa the store' ""discoveri center."" Mani custom need the experi of touch the products, listen to them, and interact with them befor make a purchase. Thi provid a safe place for experi and discoveri of the features, capabilities, and benefit of the products. Kindl e-read could also be found on shelv among the books, display a nearbi title, with custom testimoni regard their love of the product.Sign advis custom that Amazon Prime member would pay the same price found on the websit for both book and devices. For non-members, devic cost the same as for members, but they paid the list price for books. Staff would help suggest that they would save on their purchas by becom Amazon Prime member and detail the mani addit benefit of membership.Investor takeawayTh one thread run through the entir visit wasn't so much that thi wa a bookstore, though by all outward appear it was. Amazon Book provid all the familiar trap and is a delight bookstor in it own right -- wide aisles, top sellers, and easi to see book make it an ideal place to while away an afternoon. The undercurrent, though, reveal a rather ingeni way of familiar custom with Amazon product and services.Thi is an important, when consid the follow statistics. Amazon estim that Prime member spend twice the amount of non-members, though some estim put that number as high as 4.6 times. Current Prime membership is estim at 63 million -- more than half of US households. The Echo and Echo Dot have an instal base of approxim 5 million, which also permit eas of ordering. Custom with a current Amazon store credit card spend 16% more than the averag Prime member. Finally, Amazon recent introduc it new Prime Reward Visa card, which offer 5% back on Amazon purchases. Each of these is part of a coordin strategi aim at increas the number of Prime members, as these custom are the company' most lucrative.A an investor, I think thi is a brilliant strategy. The promin display of it devices, the demonstr of product capabilities, and the regular remind of the benefit of Prime membership are a clever way to introduc the uniniti to the Amazon ecosystem.Find out whi Amazon.comi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Oracl CEO Safra Catz join the execut committe of Trump' presidenti transit team in December.Then there' Cramer, promis us that the post inaugur sell-off won't last and that it' actual an opportun to buy stocks.Amidst all the excit surround the swear in, the FTC su QualcommQCOMfor anti-competit practic while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchas of Oculus. So let' dig in.Appl Forc to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollow similar lawsuits, huge fine ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetit investig in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Feder Trade Commiss (FTC) ha su Qualcomm for ""de facto exclus deal that were as effect as express purchas requir and that effect foreclos Qualcomm' competitor from gain processor busi at Apple.""Th FTC alleg that Qualcomm allow Appl billion in discount for exclus use it chip and not use the compet 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel wa pushing. Thi agreement, run from 2011 to 2016, ultim kill WiMax. Appl wast no time in sourc from Intel after the expiri of the agreement in Sep 2016.Anoth point in content is Qualcomm' practic of limit access to it cellular chip and then hike royalti payments, amount to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processor manufactur by Qualcomm' competitors."" The FTC file the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm ha of cours deni the charg while Appl chose not to comment.Follow the FTC lawsuit, Appl file one of it own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Appl alleg that Qualcomm is withold for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal wa to keep Qualcomm chip in Appl product and is a fair indic that Qualcomm final ha some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deni charg that Facebook wa awar of the violat of ani employe agreement between Occulu head John Carmack and it former employ id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in thi case.

""Though HBO Now ha a much smaller librari than other SVOD [subscript video on demand] services, it ha more blockbust movi and hit seri such as Game of Throne and Westworld.""makeArticleAd();Imag source: Strategi Analytics.HBO is the big winnerHBO' stand-alon stream servic wa a late entri to the field, first launch in April 2015. The compani wa late to the parti becaus it did not want to upset it cabl partners, which had long sold the channel as a premium service. That legaci as a cabl product may be the onli reason Netflix score a victori in overal custom satisfaction, accord to Strategi Analyt Digit Media Strategi Director Michael Goodman.""When consid the bigger picture, Netflix clearli benefit from it brand 'halo' while HBO Now suffer from a neg associ with cable' legaci issues,"" he said. ""However, onc one get into the weeds, the realiti is that HBO subscrib are the most satisfi with nearli all element that make up a strong SVOD service.""Goodman did point out that the overal differ in score is rel small. He also explain that while Amazon wa the clear loser in the report, the fact that the video servic is just one element of the company' Prime membership mean it member ""may actual be the least like to churn, particularli as they'r the most like to have household incom abov $100,000.""Netflix rank highest for overal satisfaction. Imag source: Netflix.Which servic will peopl get?HBO Now cost more than ani of it rival at $14.99 a month. Hulu cost $7.99 with commerci or $11.99 without while Netflix charg $9.99 a month, and Prime cost $99 a year (or it can be purchas for $10.99 a month) and includ other perk like free two-day shipping. Goodman acknowledg that mani consum will buy more than one stream subscription, but he see HBO as potenti emerg as the top choice.""Peopl have been talk about it be a Netflix vs. Amazon battl in term of which servic viewer choose, with the other left to pick up the scraps,"" he said. ""However, if HBO continu on thi vein, we'r more like to see a situat where peopl will have one 'blockbuster' servic like HBO or HBO Now and either a Netflix or Amazon in support.""That interpret would ring more true if Netflix did not alreadi have 47.91 million U.S. subscribers, a gain of nearli 2 million pay custom in Q4. Time Warner doe not report HBO Now subscribers, but the number wa estim at about 1 million in March 2016. That' not a repres pictur of how mani peopl are watch becaus HBO still ha ten of million of tradit cabl subscribers.Ther will be more than one winnerWhat' clear from thi report is that both HBO and Netflix are consid top-tier stream servic by consum while Prime and Hulu sit at least a slight tick below. In a market where peopl are drop cabl subscript that cost more than $100 a month on average, it seem like that both HBO and Netflix can be winners.In fact, given how close these score are group and the fact that the key driver for mani Prime custom is free shipping, it' possibl that all four of these servic will continu to grow. Pay for all four would cost $45.22 a month (prorat for pay $99 for Prime all at once) and it can be argu that just get all four cost well less than cabl while offer a comparable, if not a better, array of entertain is a big win.Find out whi Netflixi one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Amazon.com, Inc. Earnings: Will Big Investments Weigh on Profitability?;1/25/2017;"On the heel of a nice 37% gain in the company' stock price in the past twelv months, the pressur is on forAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) to deliv strongli when the e-commerc and cloud-comput giant report fourth-quart result on Thursday, Feb. 2. Ahead of the quarterli update, here' a brief overview of what to watch when Amazon post it earn release.Imag source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();Amazon.com results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016 GuidanceQ4 2015Net sales$42 billion to $45.5 billion$35.7 billionOper income$0 to $1.25 billion$1.1 billionData source: Amazon' third-quart 10-Q filing.For Amazon' fourth quarter, manag expect the compani to post strong revenu growth. Management' guidanc impli revenu growth will be between 17% and 27%.However, even the high end of the guidanc for net sale fall short of the growth rate Amazon' net sale achiev in the third quarter, when revenu wa up 29% year over year. It' possible, therefore, that Amazon is lowbal it guidanc range, and revenu is more like to be in the high end of thi range.Amazon' expect for fourth-quart oper incom are where the most uncertainti for the quarter lies. Big invest in intern markets, fulfillment-cent and warehous openings, digit content, and variou Prime benefit are expect to drive oper expens higher.Amazon CFO Brian Olsavski explain the upward trajectori for the company' invest in the company' third-quart earn call:What you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of thi year is a step-up investment, primarili around digit content and also the fulfil center invest -- but also thing like Echo and Alexa which we'r ad a lot of resourc to, India and AW as we add peopl there to support addit service, rapid growth in that business.But if revenu growth come in at the high end of Amazon' guidance, the neg impact of these expens on Amazon' result won't be as noticeable, henc the wide expect rang for fourth-quart oper income. Of course, thi relationship between revenu growth and oper incom rais the stake for Amazon' revenu growth.Oth key area to watchBeyond revenu and oper income, investor should look for an updat on Amazon' Echo product and the company' cloud-comput segment.Amazon' voice-activ smart speaker were hot gift thi holiday season. Both the Echo and Echo Dot sold out befor Christma despit Amazon' ""best effort and ramped-up production."" Furthermore, the compani said record-set order of Amazon Echo famili product increas 900% over last year' holiday season. With sale of the product skyrocketing, investor should watch for an updat on how Echo is impact Amazon' business.Cloud computing. Imag source: Getti Images.Prob the most import item to watch when Amazon report result will be it Amazon Web Services, or it pay-as-you-us cloud-comput offerings, includ databas storage, applic platforms, and other inform technolog resources. Togeth these account for about 75% of Amazon' oper profits, so investor are count on AW to serv as a long-term growth driver for the company. In the third quarter, AWS' oper incom soar 102% year over year, from $428 million to $861 million, and AWS' revenu jump 55%. While Amazon' plan for aggress invest will like slow AWS' growth in oper profits, investor should look for the segment' sale to continu grow rapidly.Investor can tune into Amazon' financi result after market close on Thursday, Feb. 2; the releas will be post on the company' investor-rel page.

Apple Earnings Strategy: When To Buy AAPL Shares;1/25/2017;"Appl will releas earn soon (Shutterstock photo)Appl (AAPL) will releas their earn for the fourth quarter of 2017 next Tuesday, and the guess game ha begun. It use to be that analyst would wait until they had seen the number befor opin or chang ani rate on Appl stock. In part that wa becaus up until last year, the compani continu made those analyst look foolish by beat everi quarter’ estim by huge margins.That meant that investor who bought the stock in the run up to earn invari benefited, and analyst would rush to upgrad forecast onc the extent of the beat wa known. However, the recent slowdown in growth ha chang the dynam somewhat.makeArticleAd();Now it seem that the competit among those that cover AAPL is to see who can come out with the gloomiest earn prediction, and who can downgrad the earliest. Over the past week two big names, Barclay and Stifel have downgrad AAPL in front of earnings, both cite worri about i-Phon 7 sales.Thi kind of focu on potenti and actual neg surround Apple’ earn ha chang the way retail investor should approach the releas too. With such neg abound the stock is like to lose ground as earn approach, and/or to react to anyth but a spectacular report in a negative, or at best muted, manner.Far from buy in front of the release, then, wait until afterward make sens thi time around. That assum that buy AAPL at all would be a good idea; an assumpt not everybodi will be comfort with. The neg slant to coverag that make it like that you will be abl to pick up AAPL cheap next week will also put off some people, but a look at the fact and prospect should reassur you.First, let’ look at the stock’ actual performance. If you listen to the naysay they would have you believ that AAPL ha underperform recently. The reality, though, as demonstr by the chart below compar AAPL to the Nasdaq track ETF,QQQov the last six months, is complet different. Dure that time AAPL ha outperform it benchmark by a factor of 3, gain 24% compar to the index’ 8%.Appreci in AAPL though, as with ani stock, is about what will happen in the futur rather than what ha happen in the past, but there are a few reason to be optimist on that front too. As I wrotea few week ago, my person experi suggest that demand for the Appl Watch seri 2 is greater than anybodi expected, with a fair amount of pent up demand result from widespread shortag of the product in the holiday buy season.In addition, even those anticip lower than expect iPhon sale have note that the higher price 7 Plu ha proven more popular than expected, which should benefit the bottom line.Al of that is positive, but what investor are realli look for is for Appl to do someth spectacular again in order to re-invigor the whole ecosystem. Their recent decis to start commiss origin content for Appl TV offer the possibl of that. Content product is, of course, a veri crowd field right now, and a difficult busi at the best of times, but Appl ha a huge advantag over other that might tri to break into the market: over $200 billion in cash.A Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have shown, it onli take one or two hit to be success in thi area and with the abil to absorb a few failures, bet against Appl succeed would seem to be foolish.Add in a decent and grow dividend and buy or ad to hold of AAPL is a good idea. With that said, though, the fact that the convent wisdom seem to be that thi will be a disappoint earn releas for the compani make patienc in thi case a virtue, and wait until after next Tuesday’ report is a risk that should pay off."
If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;1/25/2017;"Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();If I could onli buy one stock right now, then there are a few box that stock need to check. I'd like the hold to be rel safe in a tumultu time but still look like to gener modest short-term growth, while have the potenti for except long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a robust balanc sheet and be rel cheap in thi expens market -- and is a littl dividend too much to ask?For all of that, look no further thanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Short-term growth prospect look goodApple' financ are massiv in almost everi way, with sale in the fiscal Q4 end Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sale and earn actual slow dure the dure quarter, down 9% and 19%, respectively, but the compani ha guid for a return to sale growth in fiscal Q1.Some Appl bear have point to the company' relianc on it iPhon -- which made up about two-third of sale in the most recent quarter -- and that those sale are start to slow as the phone seem to be satur the address market. The averag sell price (ASP) of the iPhon segment ha fallen slightli year over year.However, the iPhon could have plenti of growth left. The new iPhon 7 launch in late 2016 seem to be perform veri well alreadi and should help to boost ASP onc again. Additionally, the issu with the explodingSamsungGalaxi Note 7, which ha even been ban on all U.S. aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhon sale the highest yet.Imag source: Apple.Th bear also point to nascent growth in most of Apple' other products, such as it person computers, iPads, and the Appl Watch. One other area that' grow impress is the servic segment, which includ revenu from servic such as iTunes, iCloud, and Appl Pay. Thi segment' revenu grew 24% year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, make up 13% of total revenu as Apple' second largest segment by sale behind the iPhon segment. Servic are increasingli important, as the total number of Appl product in use continu to grow each quarter, mean more devic that are like link to an Appl account and could help servic revenu to continu grow nicely.Apple' robust financi positionWhil Apple' sale and earn have come under pressure, it cash growth ha not. Apple' oper cash flow in the most recent quarter surg to $16 billion, a new compani record for that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the compani ha grown it total cash and invest to $238 billion, more than a third of it market cap, and aboutdoubl the next wealthiest compani in the Unit States.Unfortun for Apple' capit expenditur advocates, about 90% of that money is store out of the U.S., as the compani ha resist pay heavi repatri tax to bring it back home. However, Presid Trump ha signal that he'd like to offer a much lower tax rate, mayb as low as 10%, for compani in Apple' posit that are seek to send huge chunk of money home. There are certainli other risk for Appl in some of Trump' propos tax ideas, such as potenti import tariff on good manufactur overseas, but thi one point is import for what it could mean for Apple' cash avail for immedi use.Long-term growth potentialApple' new wireless headphones, call ""air pods."" Imag source: Apple.Apple' modest short-term growth on continu increment innov and execut is encouraging, but it' much more fun to consid Apple' moonshot long-term growth possibilities. Appl increas it research and develop spend by about 25% to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.Speak of the company' huge cash position, there are a few fun reckless predict we can make about what the compani might spend that money on developing. Self-driv cars, virtual and augment reality, and more recent origin content for iTun are all area of growth that tech industri analyst are look for from Apple.Mi favorit reckless predict is that Appl will begin compet more heavili in artifici intelligence. Apple' Siri wa one of the first voice-bas search tool beforeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) enter the space with their smart home voice-activ devices.Amazon and Googl beat Appl to market with their home assist devices, but Appl isn't known for be an earli market mover -- rather, Appl ha a knack for swoop in with amaz product that in turn domin the market that' alreadi there. Let' not forget that Amazon and Googl have ventur into Apple' world with their consum electron much more than Appl would be ventur into their with it own artifici intellig assistant.WhyAppl stockstil look like a great buyFinally, in term of valuation, Appl still look cheap. Even though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it' still trade at just 14 time earnings. Compar that with around 25 time earn on averag for the S&P 500, Googl at 30, and Amazon at 185. Also, Appl stock ha run up quickli lately, but it' still down from it high of around $135 in mid-2015, so it recent run doesn't look unreasonable.Add to that a rel cheap valuation, as well as all of the point cover here, that Appl stock also pay a 2% dividend yield, which could veri well rise as Appl deploy more of it huge cash load in 2017. The best invest strategi is one that' well diversified, but for all of those point -- if I could onli buy one stock, Appl continu to look like a great stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Importantly, those un-grandfath in the fourth quarter saw just a $1 increase, while most of the earlier price increas were $2.Netflix note that subscrib churn increas more than expect in the second quarter, and it clearli remain elev in the third quarter. However, manag also told investor that gross addit remain in line with expectations. In the fourth quarter, it seem churn rate return to normal levels.What' most tell is the amount Netflix spent on marketing, particularli in the U.S. Market expens actual declin compar to the third quarter, but Netflix manag to add five time as mani subscribers. Unless Netflix made some drastic chang in market last quarter (it didn't), it gross add have like remain rel stabl (with adjust for seasonality).It' also worth note that some custom who left over the Summer may have rejoin last quarter. Netflix' constant stream of new releas make it difficult to stay away from it onc you'v gotten use to it.Pul forward some subscribersNetflix' outlook for the first quarter is about in line with analysts' expectations, but it expect a littl less from the U.S. and a littl more from the rest of the world. In it letter to shareholders, manag wrote, ""We believ our strong Q4 result like pull forward some net add from Q1'17 to Q4'16.""To be clear, that' not a bad thing. The sooner peopl sign up, the sooner Netflix start make money off of them. But it doe mean investor should temper their expect for the first quarter, especi with the new season ofHous of Cardsb push back into the second quarter.A new high-revenu subscrib baseNow that Netflix custom are all pay higher rates, the compani should continu to add subscrib at a more steadi pace. Netflix said it averag sale price per U.S. subscrib wa up 15% last quarter thank to it price increase. As a result, domest revenu increas 27%, while the subscrib base increas just 10%.Netflix will face more pressur on intern growth thi year now that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) launch Prime Instant Video globally. What' more,Amazon is undercut Netflix' pricingin most countries, which could constrain Netflix' abil to keep increas it prices.Netflix may respond by shift some of it market budget from the U.S. to it Intern division. Of course, it will also continu invest in new origin and licens content for it intern audience. But Amazon ha the market and content budget to keep up with Netflix.Wheth that impact Netflix' abil to continu grow it subscrib base or rais price remain to be seen.

The Problem With Apple's TV Ambitions;1/24/2017;"Imag Source: Motley Fool.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha toy with the idea of enter the televis industri for what seem like age now. Sinc it unveil the origin Appl TV in 2007, the compani ha consid manufactur it own televis set, put togeth a ""skinni bundle,"" and even, accord to pundits, make an offer for a compani likeNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) .makeArticleAd();Appl ha long had a foothold in music ever sinc it launch iTunes, and televis could bring the same complementari benefit to it ecosystem. Appl alreadi sell mani of the devic use to consum stream video, and technolog ha tip the entertain scale toward tech compani rather than tradit media players. After Netflix, e-commerc giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ha made the biggest splash in streaming.Now Appl want to join the herd, produc it own origin shows. Accord toTheWal Street Journal, the compani ha been in talk with produc to make it own programming, which would be avail to subscrib of it $10/month music-stream service. The compani hope to launch such program by the end of 2017.However, while it seem natur for Appl to have ambit in TV, dive straight into origin program could present a number of challeng for the company.1. Profit are thinAft year of breakneck intern expansion, Netflix is final set to deliv it first year of ""materi profits"" sinc 2011, when it split it stream servic from it DVD-by-mail busi after year of oper at breakeven. Amazon, meanwhile, doesn't break out figur for it stream service, and essenti give it away to it Prime members, use it content as a carrot to entic more peopl to shop on it website.Th point is that video stream is no one' idea of a cash cow at thi point. The servic are so cheap, at about $10/month, that a compani need to gener a substanti base befor hope to make a profit. Netflix, for example, is set to top 100 million subscrib thi year, but it took the compani year to get to that point. Appl could oper the servic at a loss, but that seem contrari to the company' high-margin busi model. With more than $45 billion in net incom in it last fiscal year, it' go to take more than a small video stream servic to move the needle.2. Where' the expertise?Appl is a device-maker. It brand and it profit come from make hardwar like the iPhone, iPad, and the Mac. Develop and shop for TV show is outsid of it core competencies, and becaus iTun ha languish over the years, it lack the detail data that competitor like Netflix have on custom preferences.Analyst dismiss Netflix' initi ambit in origin programming, but the company' vast databas guid it when it chose to remak the British seriesHous of Cards, as it recogn that it subscrib had a penchant for polit drama and actor Kevin Spacey. That show would be the first of sever hit seri for Netflix.Amazon may have had to start more from scratch, though it had it own a la cart stream servic befor get into originals. That company' cultur also prize innovation, risk-taking, and failure, and it launch it origin program in 2013, give it a signific head start over Apple. Thank to it Prime subscrib base, the compani quickli found an audienc for it shows. In comparison, Appl under Tim Cook seem more content to leverag it current asset and product into new revenu stream rather than build fresh ones.If Appl wish to give away origin program to it Appl Music subscribers, it may be abl to build viewership like Amazon did. But Appl doesn't have the same interest in ad perk to Appl Music the way Amazon doe with Prime. Ultimately, the compani need to find a way to grow profits, and origin TV seem unlik to do that either directli or indirectli as it impact on hardwar sale would probabl be limited.Apple' track record in televis so far also bode poorli for it ambitions, as the compani seem unclear of it ultim goal and is unabl to success negoti with media partners. With it hardwar sale stalling, Appl ha increasingli turn to servic like Appl Music or Appl Pay, but the relationship between it devic and TV seem tenuou at best. Rather than enter the increasingli competit media environment, the compani would be better off lead with it strength, directli invest in research and develop that would advanc hardwar sale or develop it next blockbust product..10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI Monster;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhen investor think of artifici intellig stocks,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't usual the first name that come to mind. Mani consum viewAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) as the leader in at-hom AI, due to the success of the company' Echo device, while ""Watson"" fromIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is arguabl the top turn-key artifici intellig solut for enterprise-level entities.Thos investor who believ AI is the future, however, may want to put MSFT stock back on their radar as a way to play the movement.makeArticleAd();Th softwar giant' recent acquisit of Maluuba speak volum about it artifici intellig ambit and what it actual want to ""do"" with it.What' Maluuba?Maluuba isn't a household name, but within artifici intellig circl (and these are VP of AI Research Harri Shum' words), ""Maluuba' vision is to advanc toward a more gener artifici intellig by creat liter machin that can think, reason and commun like human - a vision exactli in line with ours.""In simpler terms, the AI agent doesn't just serv up a can respons to the most like question it think it' be ask base on keywords. Rather, Maluuba understand the word be used,their context, and what inform is desired. The util of such a tool could vari from find a specif qualif or experi from within a company' rank to a chatbot that actual work without talk in circles.Thos are just small exampl of how a next-gener artifici intellig - call artifici gener intelligence, in thi case - could be use and monetized. In September, when Microsoft assembl 5,000 engin to work on AI, Shum specif point out that such a technolog could not onli make Cortana and Skype more potent, butcould be incorpor into Microsoft' popular cloud-bas app such as Offic 365 and Azureto enhanc the ease-of-us factor for those platforms.7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stock That Are Dead Weight Right NowYou Ain't Seen Nothin' YetIt' difficult to see, or sense, but Microsoft is develop it AGI know-how with as much of a philosoph bent as it is a technic one.Just in time, too. AsCIO' Matt Kapko observ in December, ""While machin learn ha gener tremend interest throughout the enterprise, a wide gap still exist between research and benefici use case in the real world.""Th ramped-up focu on AI (and thi happen well befor Maluuba) couldn't have come at a better time for Microsoft, either, and by extension, for owner of MSFT stock.Cal a spade a spade, Microsoft larg miss out on the earli phase of artifici intelligence; now it' play catch up.

Berkshire Hathaway Sold $2 Billion of Wal-Mart Stock: Time for You to Sell, Too?;1/24/2017;"Warren Buffett.

But in the third quarter of 2016, it sell acceler as it dump 70% of it remain stake, or about $2 billion.makeArticleAd();Though Buffett ha pooh-pooh technolog through hi career, the Oracl of Omaha conced at Berkshire' sharehold meet last year that brick-and-mortar retail would have troubl keep up withAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .At the conference, Buffett call Amazon founder Jeff Bezo a ""genius,"" saying, ""We haven't seen mani businessmen like him. ""Overwhelmingly, he' taken thing you and I'v been buy and he' figur out a way to make us happier buy those products, either by fast deliveri or price or whatev it may be, and that' remarkable.""That conclus ha like led Berkshir to shed it stake in Wal-Mart in recent quarter as it is squar in Amazon' path. Berkshir may have dump more Wal-Mart share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Wal-Mart at a crossroadsIt' never good when Buffett, probabl the most respect investor of all time, is sell your stock. A look at Wal-Mart' perform also may explain whi he sold, especi compar to Amazon, which ha been the best-perform stock in the last 20 years.WMTdata byYCharts.But as savvi investor know, past perform is not a guarante of futur returns.Wal-Mart today is at a crossroads. CEO Doug McMillon ha taken sever step to revamp the compani sinc take the helm three year ago. He' rais the base wage to $10 per hour, streamlin the promot process, and made clean up store and custom servic a priority. The compani ha also invest billion in e-commerce, open hundr of groceri pick-up kiosks, and acquir start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion.Brick-and-mortar retail got hammer over the holiday season, but Wal-Mart ha not report holiday sales. The retail giant is also come off eight straight quarter of compar sale growth, a sign it' outperform the broader retail industry.Becaus of it invest in higher wage and e-commerce, the compani is expect profit to fall in fiscal 2017, which end thi month, then be flat dure fiscal 2018, and return to growth in fiscal 2019. In other words, investor will need to be patient as the compani continu to invest.What' a sharehold to doWal-Mart investor should know what to expect from such a stock. It' a defens dividend payer that ha steadili increas it dividend for 43 year in a row, make it a Dividend Aristocrat. Unlik a volatil stock like Amazon, which ha the potenti to blockbust return but also put up signific losses, Wal-Mart will be a stabl slow-growth investment. The stock is unlik to significantli outperform the market, especi given the challeng in retail and the invest it' making. The natur of the company' busi as a low-cost provid mean that the stock is essenti recession-proof, and investor often flock to it when it look like tough time are ahead.So the decis to sell Wal-Mart should probabl be determin by your invest style. If you'r a risk-avers investor look for modest growth and a solid dividend yield at 3%, then Wal-Mart look a like a good choice. If you'r look for higher potenti growth, perhap follow Buffett and dump Wal-Mart for a compani whose profit are actual increasing.10 stock we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Unstoppable Despite Any Pitfalls;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade Tips""What happened?"" It' a question often pose to celebr crush that are now decad past their prime. And it seem like an appropri inquiri forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG stock is the anchor among the so-cal ""FANG"" stocks, which includeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and the hot-runningNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Arguably, GOOG is the most cultur signific of the bunch, yet it recent perform ha left a lot to be desired.Source: ShutterstockFor 2016, GOOG stock return a whop 4% even. To put that underperform into perspective, Alphabet Inc gave sharehold 48% return on averag dure the 2000 decad when it wa first introduc to the markets.makeArticleAd();Inclus of last year, it lifetim averag is now a littl bit abov 30%. In fact, compar to the other FANGs, GOOG stock is the absolut worst. And while it' almost ident to Facebook' overal performance, both Amazon and Netflix put Alphabet Inc to shame.That' the kind of post-mortem talk you hear on CNBC when realiti final catch up to a specul company. Certainly, it' not the kind of metric you expect from a bigger-than-life-itself organ like GOOGL. I mean, thi is a compani that wa thecenterpieceof a Vinc Vaughn and Owen Wilson movi - and they total agre to it!But just like the movie' plot, outsid appear can be deceiving. Here are a few reason whi you should still give GOOG stock a chance.GOOG Is More Than a Search EngineFirst off, Alphabet Inc isn't just a search engine. Yes, I complet understand the argument that the vast, overwhelm major of it multi-billion dollar busi deriv from advertisements. However, there are unmistak sign of diversity.10 Stock to Buy to Surviv a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017A InvestorPlac contributorWil Ashworth point out, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, ""GOOGL gener $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Thi repres 10.9% of the Googl segment' overal revenu of $22.3 billion. For the first nine month of the year, Google' other revenu came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier."" Essentially, Alphabet Inc can spin off a brand new busi separ from advertisements, and it would do just fine.Indeed, GOOG stock is back by coverag of over157 products, accord to anoth InvestorPlac colleague, Aaron Levitt. While a good chunk of the offer are web-bas applications, such as Gmail, Map and Chrome, ""the firm ha continu to plow some big-tim dollar onto the physic devic market."" As we move forward, GOOG stock may be less recogn as an app investment, and more as a consum electron invest similar toAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) orSoni Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE).A both Ashworth and Levitt note, diversif toward physic devic and non-cor busi don't necessarili endear folk to GOOG stock. Mani of these divis are money losers. The Motorola ventur wa a particularli rotten deal.However, I wholeheartedli agre with Ashworth' thesis: ""A pain as it is for investor to see Alphabet pour good money after bad into it Other Bets, GOOGL stock depend on it. Becaus it legaci busi like won't be thi profit 10 year from now.""Alphabet Inc Ha the Ultim Trump CardPerhap most analyst bullish toward GOOG stock have laid out similar argument - Alphabet Inc is more than just a one trick pony. Consid all the evidence, it would be foolish to attempt to counter it. But allow me to shamelessli grab the ultra-low hang fruit. Just what the heck is wrong with be a one trick pony?3 Reason Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Deliv in 2017We'r not talk aboutPolaroidhere.Click to EnlargeBi invest in GOOG stock, you are take ownership in not onli a massiv company, but a cultur phenomenon.Consid that among the mostpopular search engineson the internet, Googl beat out second-best competitor Bing by a margin of 300%! Startlingly, the gap between first and fifth place is nearli 1,200%. Against the bottom run of the top ten, the gap is nearli 12,000%.In other words, if you think that Googl will ever be upend by anyon else, think again. No other invest besid GOOG stock ha such domin over their industri that peopl refer to it by the compani name. WeGoogleth on the web. And until the day I hear ""I'lliPhoneyou,"" peopl can rest assur in their GOOG position.Put in the simplest of terms, unless there are Russian ICBM rain down on us, I would never short GOOG stock. The onli caveat would be to point out instanc of potenti technic weakness. Even then, the volatil would like be on a short-term basis. As I state above, Alphabet Inc ha too much of a power brand to ever fail.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto wa long SNE.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stock That Could Be Hold You Back10 Dividend Growth Stock That Simpli Print MoneyTh postWhi Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Unstopp Despit Ani Pitfallsappear first onInvestorPlace."

Right now, Target is the more profit company, and we expect that edg to last.Scoreboard: Target 1, Wal-Mart 0WMT and TGT Stock ValuationsBoth of these stock are cheap. A varieti of factors, from low growth potential, to theevergreen fear overAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN), have weigh on their stock prices.WMT wa up 13% in 2016, while TGT wa flat, but both stock are still quit cheap base on their current profits. Both stock have a price to econom book valu ratio (PEBV) of just 0.6. Thi ratio mean the market expect a perman 40% declin in after-tax oper profit (NOPAT) for both companies.Whil it' certainli fair to be wari of the risk face tradit retailers, such a pessimist outlook seem unwarranted. Both Wal-Mart and Target are appealingli cheap, which make thi round a push.Scoreboard: Target 1.5, Wal-Mart 0.5Let' continu to evalu these two giants…Cash Flow YieldsCash is king. Thi fact goe doubl for compani like Wal-Mart and Target that requir heavi capit invest and return a larg amount of capit to sharehold through dividend and buybacks.Both Target and Wal-Mart gener substantialfre cash flow. Per Figur 2, that cash flow come in differ ways. Wal-Mart provid a steadi stream of cash year after year, wherea Target ha oscil between year of great free cash flow and year of low or even neg cash flow.Figur 2: Wal-Mart Vs. Target Free Cash Flow Yield: 1999-CurrentSources: New Constructs, LLC and compani filings.Whil Wal-Mart may have the more consist stream of cash flow, Target ha had a better free cash flow yield in four out of the past six years, and a superior averag yield in that timeframe, so Target win thi round.Scoreboard: Target 2.5, Wal-Mart 0.5Growth OpportunitiesNeith of these compani offer investor signific growth potenti from their impress brick-and-mortar footprints. Target' sale have been flat to down recently, and it'sfocus on small storesthat offer onli increment growth go forward. Wal-Mart ha announc that it'sslow the paceof it new store open over the next coupl years.Onlin sale have been rosier. Target announc onlin salesgrew by 26%in the most recent quarter. Wal-Mart acquir therapidli grow Jet.comin a deal that, while richli valued, should provid a signific boost to it e-commerc efforts.Consensu analyst forecast have Wal-Mart' revenu grow by 1.3% compound annual over the next two years. That' not a number to gener much excitement, but it' better than their project for a 1.9% compound annual declin in Target' sales. Wal-Mart win thi round.Scoreboard: Target 2.5, Wal-Mart 1.5Corpor GovernanceCorpor governance, especi execut compensation, is a critic and underappreci aspect of invest analysis. High qualiti execut compens plan hold execut account for capit alloc and align their interest with shareholders. Low qualiti compens plan can encourag execut to engag in activ thatdestroy sharehold value.Both Wal-Mart and Target start off great by tie a signific portion of executive' long-term stock grant to ROIC. Even better, they both make an effort to calcul an accur ROIC and account foroff-bal sheet debtdu to oper leases.Dig deeper though, Target' ROIC methodolog is more rigorous. It not onli capit oper leases, it also add back theimpli interest componentof those leases. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart use pretax oper incom rather than NOPAT, which along with some other unorthodox practic make it ROIC number less reliable.W applaud those firm that make the effort to hold execut account to perform metric that are directli align with sharehold valu creation. Though ROIC is a simpl concept, it is a rathermajor undertak to get right, especi across multipl companies. Target' effort here are noteworthy.Wal-Mart doe better than most compani we cover at align execut incent with sharehold value, but Target' execut compens plan is one of the gold standard in corpor America. Target win thi round and the matchScoreboard: Target 3.5, Wal-Mart 1.5Our Conclusion: If You Must Choos One…Y can't go wrong with either of these stocks. They both have great track record of profit and cheap valuations. If you have to choos just one, though, Target' superior ROIC, cash flow, and execut compens practic make it the better pick in 2017 for investors.7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 2017Thi articl origin publishedhereon Januari 3, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receiv no compens to write about ani specif stock, sector, style, or theme.Articl by Sam McBride,New ConstructsTh postWal-Mart vs Target - Stock Faceoff: Giant Of Retailappear first onValueWalk.Mani academ claim invest is a ""random walk.""

What the current administr need to deal with is that autom and robot have chang the natur of work. That chang might be delay in some case becaus foreign worker are cheaper than automating, but that' realli just a question of time.Th current administr ha a choic when it come to jobs.
