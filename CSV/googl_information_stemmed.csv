Buy Some Downside to Own Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock at a Discount,3/24/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsInvestor have been hammer inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in more way than one thi week. But is it time to buy GOOGL stock' pullback? Let' take a look at what' behind the price action, the technic pictur and a limited-risk option strategi on Alphabet to better navig the environment.makeArticleAd();Source:Travi Wise via FlickrTh consensu view earlier thi year had been anypolit risksfac Alphabet would sure be come out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it wa a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbor in the U.K. that sent share of GOOGL tumbl thi week.For the weekli period, share of Alphabet are off about 4% after influenti foreign ad buyer lash out about how their ad had been place alongsid terrorist and other extrem media on Google' YouTube. For it part, Alphabet is take action and look to improv its""brand safeti controls.""Improv aren't happen soon enough for some though. Earlier thi week, asBarron' noted,France'sHava SA, the world' sixth largest market agency, state it had pull the plug on all client advertis in the U.K. from both YouTub and the Googl Display Network.And now American compani are join the rank in protest as well.10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotIn the interim and while the controversi play out withbullslik Pacif Crest and bears, or at leastalarmists, chime in, we can take a visual look at how thing are play out in GOOGL stock.GOOGL Stock Daili ChartJust prior to thi week' sudden and volatil bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been make all the right technic moves. Sinc the begin of 2017, share of Alphabet manag to success clear the prior all-tim highs, rally, establish a success test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.Now - despit the quick drop of around 4% thi week - our view is Alphabet could be set up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fing among us, the hammer of share by Thursday' close actual form a bullish hammer low.Th revers pattern ha some back from an oversold stochast condit and receiv price confirm earli Friday as GOOGL stock move abov the candlestick' high of $841.69.I it perfect? No. There ha been some distribution, the current setup is modestli below the well-watch 50-day simpl move averag and trend do eventu end.Person and given the mix evidence, I'd rather look at enter into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potenti area of support hold a coupl retrac levels, the 200-day simpl move averag and a second test of the prior highs, and amount to a correct of up to 9% within the bigger picture' establish uptrend.GOOGL Long Put ButterflyGiven my belief that the hammer may not be complet done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atyp approach to posit for downsid and buy stock at lower levels.With GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is price for $2.20 or better. The bearishli target butterfli achiev it maximum profit of $12.80 if share fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limit risk spread maintain a profit rang from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gain can even be realiz outsid the target price zone.Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Stock Ha a Power New WeaponIf GOOGL stock actual begin to ralli in a materi way, I would person look to cut risk use a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initi debit is small, hold on and remain on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultim want to own at lower price doesn't make sense.Wer share of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buy GOOGL on weak as it enter the support zone, know the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibl a lot less, is worth considering.Invest account under Christoph Tyler' manag do not current own posit in ani of the secur or their deriv mention in thi article.

The compani ha earn it way to the top, make a piec of hardwar - the iPhon - not onli a technic marvel, but a statu symbol and lifestyl centerpiec like no other. The devic keep million of consum rang from tween to geriatr with their nose buri in their smartphon in all four corner of the earth.Nevertheless …While Appl ha been larg deserv of it spot on so mani investors' pedestals, that sort of collect homag is alway dangerous. Noth last forever, and as unpopular as the premis may be, it would be wise to at least entertain the possibl that the next-gener iPhon (refer to the iPhon 8 so far) could the unveil that start expos Apple' cracks.iPhon 8 Flop? Never!Befor you pull out your pitchfork, start heat up the tar and gather your feathers, dial it back just a bit. Thi isn't to say that even a mediocr Appl still isn't better than most ani other stock on the planet.10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashStill, there are three key reason the iPhon 8 could end up not beingth panaceait ha been made out to be. Yes, they'r rather obvious, but concern all the same:1. Peopl Realli Are Grow Tire of the Constant ConnectivityIt wa fun for a few years, but some smartphon owner - an increas number of them - are start to realiz their unhealthi addict to their devices. A survey perform last year indic that42% of Americansconstantli check their phone for new messages. It' a statist be notic by imparti observ like CTV technolog analyst Carmi Levy.Levi commentedlast year:""Th promis of technolog is that it'll improv our lives, but sometim we becom enslav to the technolog becaus there' so much go on. A certain part of our brain is alway look for someth that is perhap simpler … and deliv as promis with fewer frustrations.""Enough consum are start to move the notion out of their subconsci into their conscious.2. $1,000 for a Phone? Really?Yep, somebodi out there won't think twice about pay it. A lot of peopl won't think twice about pay it. For a wide swath of iPhon fan who will sooner or later realiz that' more than one month' rent or mortgag payment, though, they'r due a ""get real"" moment.3. Strong CompetitionFor the longest time, Appl had littl to no competition. That' chang though. Yes,th explod batteri debacleSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) face with it Galaxi 7 phone wa damning, and it' not like the Googl Pixel fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)wa a smash successthat threaten Appl either.Both compani are still overhaul their hardwar and improv their design though, and consum are take notice, for about a third to half the cost of an iPhone.Potenti Impact on AAPL StockA for the impact a lacklust iPhon 8 respons might have on AAPL stock, one can onli guess. But, one can still make an educ guess.For it most recent complet quarter, Applesold 78.29 million iPhones, gener $54.38 billion worth of revenue. That' not necessarili a full pictur of the then-new iPhon 7' success, however. The devic wa actual unveil a few day prior to the begin of the quarter, and saw tremend sale immedi after it launch. For the iPhon 7' inaugur quarter, the compani producediPhon revenu of $28.16 billion, sell 45.51 million units. Between both quarters, the bulk of the iPhon sold were the 7 model.It wa record-break success, by the way, with the78.29 million iPhon sold last quarteredg out sale of the second edit of the iPhon 6 in the compar quarter a year earlier. The averag sell price for the most recent quarter come out to $695 apiece.That price tag doe present someth of a quandari for ani estim regard the impend success of the iPhon 8. It could sell 30% fewer phones, but inasmuch as the cost of the 8 is more than 40% greater than the 7, Appl could conceiv do just as well (and possibl post wider margins).Thi is where put AAPL stock on a pedest becom a bit of a problem though.Bottom Line for AppleFor better or worse, Appl sharehold have larg been train to expect beat not just of revenu and earn estimates, but also beat of sale as measur by units. Ani weak on ani front pose a risk to a usual frothi AAPL valuation.Mi prediction? I firmli believ the iPhon 8 will be an unexpect disappointment, though that' distinctli differ than a flop. Some - though not all - will balk at a four-figur sticker price, forc peopl to final ask themselv ""What are we doing, pay a thousand buck to keep in touch onFacebookand to play mobil video game on a five inch screen?""Again, don't misunderstand. I fulli acknowledg there are some utilitarian featur on the iPhon 8 that will be view as a must-hav for some consumers.Wireless chargingi convenient, and the built-in touch ID is go to be critic to some busi user concern about security.Bi and larg though, I have to believ the averag consum just want a phone they can use to stay connected, via the web and voice. An edge-to-edg screen or a lack of a home button isn't the game-chang it' be made it to be, especi at $1,000 a pop … even for peopl who onli own the iPhon as a statu symbol.Krog Co (KR) Stock Look Veri Attract Right NowTo quantifi my pessimism, I'm guess Appl sell 70 million unit of the iPhon 8 in it first full quarter start in October. That translat into more year-over-year revenue, but is still a letdown for what' suppos to be ""the best iPhon ever."" Such a result could easili send AAPL sock careening, though odd are good the market would figur it out befor the offici number were releas by the company. AAPL stock could lose as much as 20% of it valu on that kind of worry.Perhap wors than the number themselv would be the sudden realiz that Appl is inde fallible. A bad quarter is forgivable. A flaw busi model isn't as easili forgotten.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9 a Share10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTh postHow Much Will Appl Inc.

Is India the Next Big Market for Apple's (AAPL) iPhones?,3/24/2017,"Indian will soon seeAppl Inc.'sAAPLiPhon 6 and 6S model packag with a tag line of 'Assembl in India'. Yes, it' true.PerTh Wall Street Journal, the company' Taiwanes supplier - Wistron - is like to start make the aforesaid model in the next four to six week at it manufactur facil in Bengaluru, India. It should be note that Wistron, in late Dec 2016, sought permiss for expans of it manufactur facil from the Indian government.Though, Apple' share were down 0.4% yesterday, it ha gain 21.6% so far thi year. Notably, the stock' year-to-d return is almost in line with the Zack categorizedComputer-Miniindustry' gain of 21.5%.Whi is Appl Highli Focus on India?Sinc 2016, Appl ha been increas it focu on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphon market in the country, of which it reportedli hold onli 2% as of now. Appl ha been face a slowdown in iPhon demand in most regions, either becaus of stiff competit or regulatori hurdl (China) or market satur (the U.S). Thus, it make sens for the compani to solidify/fortifi it posit in India, which is project to becom the second largest smartphon market in the world.Notably, in fiscal 2016, Appl sale in India surg approxim 50% over the prior fiscal. Moreover, dure it last quarterli earn confer call, the compani reveal that it smartphon sale in the countri regist 51% year-over-year growth in the first three quarter of fiscal 2017.Apple, of course, is not the onli tech player eye India for growth. Given the potenti of thi market, Silicon Valley' interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGL, to Facebook Inc.FB, all remain laser focus on the Indian market.Furthermore, a younger and skill population, along with increas invest in broadband network by the government, make India an attract growth opportun for Appl over the long run. In fact, the Indian government, under Prime Minist Narendra Modi, is eager to bring foreign capit and boost manufactur facil in the country.Th recent outlin FDI polici by Indian govern also bode well for the compani as it elimin the requir to local sourc product for at least a three-year period. Thi will enabl Appl to open it solely-own retail store in India. Thereafter, the compani will have to compli with the rule. In addition, compani ha partner with telecom compani - Relianc - which is provid it Jio (a uniqu all-IP network) servic for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook wa on a charm offens in India. Besid meet Modi, he also announc the open of an iO App Design and Develop Acceler in Bengaluru, as well as a map develop offic in anoth Indian citi - Hyderabad - in collabor with region firm RMSI. He wa also seen hobnob with industrialist and movi star dure hi maiden visit to the country.Wil the Move Aid Apple' Cause?P analysts, the lion' share of Apple' revenu in the countri come from devices, which are a coupl of gener old. Newer model have rel low demand given the hefti price tag. Accord to reports, the Appl team in India is tri to increas revenu to $3 billion by fiscal 2017-18. Also, by local assembl operations, the compani can start oper it own retail outlet and avail a 10% tax benefit. This, in turn, is like to lower prices.However, a Forb analyst observ that even if Appl start product locally, the price might not come down as much. Thi is because, at present, onli assembl oper can be carri out in India as the countri lack a robust suppli chain like China. Furthermore, the analyst argu that though labor cost in the countri is cheaper than China, product is rel better in China. Simpl assembl may not drastic bring down prices. However, if India can ""spark"" a creation of local suppli chain like China, then it will be a big positive.Moreover, anoth analyst observ that Apple' lack of focu on region customers' demand is a press concern. India is categor by handset that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Appl is not keen on make dual SIM handsets. Thi could be a veri big impedi to growth in the country. The iPhon manufactur is alreadi late to the party. It rival Samsung ha long been in the market, and with reportedli 23% share, it is current the lead player in the country.Bottom LineDespit Modi' histor move of demonet Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currenc note to combat corruption, the compani regist all-tim record revenu figur in third-quart fiscal 2017, while it variou competitor were hurt by the same. In our opinion, thi show Indians' immens love for Apple' products.However, the compani lag behind it competitor on the price front. We believ that the latest move will allow Appl evad import duti tariffs. Thi will enabl it to price it smartphon more competitively.Furthermore, by manufactur iPhon model in India, Appl will be abl to captur consider market share in one of the world' fastest grow economy, where it ha a meager presenc when compar with other rival such as Samsung, Micromax etc.Despit the pro and cons, Appl is expect to continu it expans drive in India.

The Future of Virtual Reality: 5 Things to Know,3/22/2017,"Virtual realiti (VR) and augment realiti (AR) technolog have gotten a lot of attent over the past few years.Sony' PlayStat VR headset is shine a spotlight onth viabil of VR gaming, whileAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl Cardboard and new Daydream View headset are push mobil VR into the mainstream. The unexpect success of Pokemon Go last year show that smartphon user are readi and will to adopt augment reality. AndMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) develop of it HoloLen goggl aim to prove that the virtual and augment world will soon becom a part of our reality.Investor look to benefit from these two intertwin market should keep these five thing in mind:Imag source: Google.makeArticleAd();1. The futur of VR could be our next comput platformMuch of the attent surround virtual realiti right now ha to do mainli with how it will be use for gaming, filmmaking, or other entertain content. ButFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg believ that VR could surpass all of these categories.H said in a Bloomberginterviewlast year that VR is ""a good candid to be the next major comput platform."" Zuckerberg think it'll take a while for us to get there (more on that later), but he' optimist that VR could be a primari form of commun technolog in the near future:Photo are richer than text; video, much richer than photos. But that' not the end, right? I mean, it' like thi indefinit continuum of get closer and closer to be abl to captur what a person' natur experi and thought is, and just be abl to immedi captur that and design it howev you want and share it with whomev you want.2. It will take a while for VR to gain tractionVR is still in it veri earli stages, and it' like that it will take mani more year befor it becom mainstream -- Zuckerberg ha put the timefram at five to 10 years.Ad to the slow pace is the fact that some hype technologies, like Magic Leap' AR headset, have recent been found to be behind schedule.Th Informationreported(subscript required) at the end of the last year that Magic Leap -- which ha rais $1.4 billion in fund in about three year -- pivot away from some of it earlier fiber optic technolog and now trail the imag qualiti of Microsoft' HoloLens.And even the HoloLens, which current cost $3,000 and is mainli for developers, ha sold onli thousand of units. Roger Walkden, Microsoft' HoloLen commerci lead,rec toldTh Inquirerthat, ""We'r not tri to sell hundr of thousand or million or anything, it' expensive, and it' not in huge numbers. So we'r happi with the level of sale that we'v got -- I can't tell you anyth about the numbers, but it' in thousands, not hundr of thousands, and that' fine. That' all we need.""Whil Microsoft may be pleas with those numbers, it' still a clear indic that VR and AR have a long way go befor they becom mainstream.And then there' the recent news that Facebook' Oculu is shut down 200 of it 500 demo site within Best Buy stores, reportedli due to thelack of public interest. The futur may be virtual, but we'r get there slowly.3. It offer a new way of see our worldJason Pontin, the editor of MIT'sTechnolog Review,recentlyinterviewedJessica Brillhart, a filmmak for virtual realiti at Google, and talk with her about how VR is current use and what it might becom in the near future. When ask if peopl will eventu use VR to record home videos, Brillhart respond that we probabl would but that it might not be a good thing,Think of everyth you forget about a birthday parti when you'r a kid. But now the rig would captur everything. You could watch someon you love respond the way she use to, or eat cake a certain way. It is go to be interest to see what happen when we aren't abl to forget anyth anymore.Th interview is a good remind that VR is still in it earli stage and it' still unclear how thi platform will be used, and whether or not we'll like exactli how it turn out.4. Virtual realiti could eventu impact all of the sensesRight now, VR is limit to a user' visual and auditori senses, but in the futur thi will like be enhanced. The gener manag of Dell' game PC manufactur Alienware, Frank Azor, said thisin an interviewwith TIME last year:Onc you begin cater to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the realiti factor of virtual realiti [becomes] stronger and the virtual piec begin to fade.Break the barrier between the virtual world and the physic world with high-end touch sensor could be the next step in virtual reality, and it won't be here for a while, but VR hardwar and softwar maker are alreadi think about how thi technolog can go from immers to fulli interactive.5. The market potenti for both AR and VR could be hugeTh virtual realiti market wa worth about $1.9 billion in 2016, but that' expect to climb to $22.4 billion by 2020. Those number includ both softwar and hardwar sales. And when you factor in AR sales, the market skyrocket even higher. The combin AR and VR market will be worth $121 billion by 2021, accord to Digi-Capital.In that same year, IDC estim more than 99 million AR and VR headset will be shipped, up from just 10 million last year, which repres a 58% compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2021..The good news for investor is that compani are just get start with AR and VR, which meansth opportun to benefit haven't passed. There are still plenti of unknowns, but as more compani ralli around these new technolog and make the necessari invest to get them off of the ground, we'r like to see the futur of AR and VR develop substanti over the next few years.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Alphabet Stock a Good Way to Invest in Self-Driving Cars?,3/22/2017,"Three thing seem pretti clear at thi point in history:Self-driv car will begin come to market befor long.They'l gener huge profit for some companies.Googl ha been a leader in develop self-driv technology.But doe it follow that Google' parent,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , will reap the reward of it technolog leadership? Or put anoth way, are the potenti profit from self-driv car a reason to add Alphabet' stock to your portfolio?A lot of comment seem to think so, but I'm veri skeptical. Here' why.makeArticleAd();Driverless ""panda cars"" were the public face of the Googl Self-Driv Car Project for sever years. Imag source: Alphabet.Alphabet ha what look like a leadership position...Googl began tinker with self-driv car way back in 2009, long befor mani investor began take the technolog seriously. The origin team behind what becam know as the Googl Self-Driv Car Project includ sever robot all-star who seem readi to invent the future. The whole thing appear to be decad beyond what the establish automak were doing.For a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some automak and auto-industri supplier have invest heavili in the technolog and made signific gains. But even so, Alphabet' self-driv unit, which wa spun out of Googl and renam Waymo late last year, retain some big advantages:Bi at least one measur -- ""disengagements,"" the number of time a human driver ha to take control of a self-driv test car -- Waymo made major progress last year andappear to be aheadof most known rivals.Maps. The first self-driv car to come to market will reli heavili on highli detail map as a backup to their sensors. Googl ha been map the world in ever-increas detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while it competitor will have to look elsewhere.Waymo ha develop it own self-driv sensor hardware, includ -- crucial -- LIDAR unit that cost much less than current commerci avail units.Thos are signific advantages. But there' a big question that might not be obviou to investor who don't have a deep understand of the auto industry:How will Waymo bring all of that to market?Waymo' current test fleet wa built in partnership with FCA, but the compani have disclos no plan to collabor on product vehicles. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobil NV....but bring it to market may prove complicatedWaymo' CEO, John Krafcik, is a respect auto-industri veteran who wa hire to lead the project in Septemb 2015. Krafcik brought a welcom dose of realist transpar to the project when he made it clear that Alphabet ha no intent of manufactur it own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would seek to bring it technolog to market via partnership with establish automakers.There' just one problem: The automak aren't exactli beat down Krafcik' door. In fact, the auto execut I'v talk with feel that they have veri good reason to steer clear of a deal with Waymo, start with control of the data gener by self-driv cars.It' almost an understat to say that automak areveryawar of the smartphon precedent. The phone maker that chose to adopt the Android oper system end up make hardwar on veri slim margins. Alphabet end up with most of the profits, becaus Android provid it with the (immens valuable) users' data.Auto execut don't want to end up in the same boat, and they know that they'll soon have altern that will allow them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one alternative, a partnership betweenDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) ,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) , andMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , aim to have a self-driv system avail to ani automak that want it by the end of 2019. That partnership will allow automak to retain much of the data, and auto execut see it as homegrown -- creat larg by establish industri suppliers, not by Silicon Valley hotshots.Given that, whi go with Waymo?That said, a coupl of big automak have kick the tire on Waymo' technology:Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) work with Googl engin last year to createth latest vehicl for Waymo' test fleet, base on the well-regard Chrysler Pacifica minivan -- but there' no sign that the two will move forward on anyth that could lead to a product for sale.Honda(NYSE: HMC) issu a somewhat odd announc in Decemb say that it wa ""enter into formal discussions"" with Waymo, though noth (so far) seem to have result from those discussions. (I specul at the time that Honda' announc might have been aboutprod other potenti partner to take action. But at least as of right now, it' not clear exactli what wa go on there.)Waymo may well find a profit line of busi in sell it sensor to other companies. And it' like that some automaker, somewhere, will eventu give it self-driv system a try.But unless other research and develop effort hit roadblock that Waymo is somehow abl to skirt, it seem unlik that it will be a domin player in self-driv system anytim in the near future.Th upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-drivingTher are plenti of good reason to consid ad Alphabet to your portfolio. But if you'r look for a target self-driv investment, Alphabet probabl isn't it: As of right now, it' not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search giant' bottom line.10 stock we like better than AlphabetWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company' quarterli revenu came in a $2.6 billion, which repres a declin of more than 2% from last year' figures.5 Big Financi Stock That Just Got Level (And What to Do Next)Even more concern wa the fact that onlin market custom declin 18.6% in 2016. For investor that consid BIDU to be the Chines Google, that' a huge deal. Advertis dollar are everyth to search engin like Baidu and Google.It' Not as Bad as It LooksThos figur are certainli scary, but when you look at the reason behind them thing start to look a littl bit rosier. It' import to note that BIDU face some major headwind last year, includ a big chang to China' advertis regulations. The cost to compli with the new rule wa signific for Baidu, whichgener around 96% of it revenu from advertising.Not onli did the new regul hit BIDU' revenu hard, but they also hurt the firm' custom numbers. The new regul includ strict rule regard how compani advertis and some of Baidu' current custom weren't abl to meet those requirements, which result in a loss.However, there could be a silver line in there for BIDU as the new requir will help the firm identifi who it qualiti custom are. If you look at per-custom spend, you'll see that those who were abl to meet the new guidelin actual spent about 14% more than they had in the fourth quarter of 2015.Huge Growth Potenti for BIDU StockWhat' import to note here is that even if BIDU is struggl now, there is a huge growth opportun for internet compani in China. While you might think that a search engin doesn't have room to expand ani further, keep in mind that China is pretti far behind the U.S. when it come to internet users. Just over 50% of the nation' populationha access to the internet.That' a big deal, becaus it mean that as the internet make it way further afield, advertis are go to be will to pay to reach even more people. Eventually, onlin advertis will be the best way to reach the major of Chines residents, and market will have to pay for that.Bottom Line on BIDU StockNot onli doe BIDU have a lot of growth potenti in it core business, but the firm ha been invest heavili in hot new technolog like artifici intellig and self-driv vehicles. While advertis revenu still make up the bulk of Baidu' bottom line, we could see big-tim benefit from the firm' focu on the future.Th company' effort to develop self-driv technolog are particularli entic becaus the cars' navig system will be equip to deal with China' complic traffic conditions.

FANG Stocks are Back in Focus,3/22/2017,"A while ago someon notic that if you took the first letter of the name of the four big modern tech companies, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Googl (GOOG:GOOGL) they spell out a wonder acronym, FANG. Of course, sinc then Googl ha gone and spoil it all by rebrand their hold compani as alphabet, but the acronym ha stuck.At the risk of spoil that alphabet synergi I would add Appl (AAPL) to the list, given that compani role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some peopl substitut Appl for Amazon and obvious if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appeal FAANG. For argument’ sake, let’ assum that all five stock are still collect known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.Th reason, though, is less about tech, or inde about busi at all, than it is about politics. The market seem to be driven at the moment by what come out of the White House. Sinc the elect there ha been a lot of faith place by trader and investor in certain polici outlin by the new administr and the Republican who domin Congress dure the campaign; a “beautiful” replac for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructur spending.makeArticleAd();Yesterday’ drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, wa reportedli trigger by worri about the healthcar bill slate to replac the Afford Care Act. It ha met with opposit from within the Republican Party, particularli from the Right, and need some seriou negoti in order to just pass the House.That in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replac passed, as most acknowledg that someth ha to fill the vacuum.Mor worri for the market, though, is that if thi bill fails, it will indic that the fiscal conserv in Congress are stick to their principles, make stimul infrastructur spend a virtual non-starter.Som of the biggest loser yesterday were in the industri and materi sector that have gain the most sinc the elect and which would be hurt most by delay in infrastructur spending. The reason the fang stock look so attract right now is becaus polici delay regard healthcar and infrastructur spend will have littl effect on them in the short term, but thing like tax reform when it doe come, especi the possibl of the repatri of oversea profits, will make an enorm difference. The consensu is that tax reform is an area that unit the parti and thu could be even hasten by a split over the Obamacar replacement.Th fli in the ointment could be that much of the potenti growth for these firm lie in oversea expansion, in particular to emerg economies. That would be a worri if the White Hous doe push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucu free market type in the GOP are flex their muscl would suggest that ani eventu move would have to be negotiated, and therefor moder from the campaign rhetoric.Al in all, then, thing look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seem to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five ha buck the downward trend of the broader market and gain in earli trading. Of cours one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refut and they may prove to be a hedg against polit driven uncertainti over the next few weeks, or even months."
Does Facebook's Video Strategy Make It a Top Growth Stock?,3/22/2017,"Yesterday,FacebookFBwa assign a Buy rate by BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield, who wa quot by media report saying, ""Not have a buy [rating] on Facebook ha clearli been a mistak in 2017."" He further ad that ""the secular trend toward mobil devic global and the acceler shift of ad dollar are simpli too strong to ignore.""Facebook' Video StrategySinc last year, Facebook ha been aggress promot live video content on it platform. Onlin video is emerg as a big opportun to boost ad revenues. Ad revenu contribut over 95% to Facebook' total revenue. Earlier, it wa report that the compani is look to grab a share of the reportedli $70 billion brand advertis that is alloc to linear TV by increas video content on it platform. At it last earn call, Facebook said that video ha emerg as a ""megatrend"" on the same line like mobile.Last year, the compani sign deal with media hous and Internet celebr to churn out more content for it live platform and ad a plethora of new featur to Facebook live. These includ enabl broadcast for a Group or Event and at the same time allow audienc to respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Also, recently, it brought on board an ex-MTV executive,Mina Lefevre, to increas origin live video content on the platform.In fact, it ha been on a sign spree to bring more live video content, especi sports. Streaming, particularli live sports, is one of the most lucr opportun as it help to boost engag level (especi millennials) and bring more advertisers. Facebook ha struck a deal with MLB and ha collabor with Univis Commun Inc. to live stream 46 Liga MX game for an undisclos amount.Mobil and live video effort are pay off big time for the social media giant. In the last report quarter, revenu of $8.8 billion increas 51% year over year. Advertis revenu were $8.629 billion, surg 53% year over year.Mobil ad revenu in the quarter were $7.2 billion (up 61% year over year), contribut 84% to total ad revenues.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteEven Instagram ha emerg as a big cash cow with over 500,000 advertisers. It is the second big ad platform after Facebook' namesak platform, though the compani ha so far refrain from provid actual ad number for Instagram. The latest Instagram-featur ""Stories"", though a SnapchatSNAPclone, look set to lure more advertis thi year. Instagram boast over 600 million MAU and over 400 million DAU while ""Stories"" on the platform have 150 million daili actives.At the last earn call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg continu to emphas on bring more video content to the platform. He also inform that the compani ha been invest on origin content and that it will keep do the same thi year as well. Facebook is also beta-test mid roll ad in it video content to boost it ad revenues.Though Facebook' video strategi look good on paper, it will be one big task to actual make it work given a number of challenges. Per media reports, ""profession content producers, such as CNN, HBO and Comedi Central, present a higher quality, which garner deeper engag and ad dollars"" and thi where Facebook might suffer. Also, the competit for ad dollar from the like of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, TwitterTWTRand Snapchat is also unnerving.Plus, the fake news dissemin problem on it platform ha been a rage controversi all through the last year. Fake news problem will definit impact attract advertisers.Our TakeContinu rise in advertis revenu as well as it strateg effort to sustain the growth momentum ha put Facebook on investors' favorit stock pick list.

The stock ha been bounc up against 52 week high and look to continu to do more of the same. It is the Bull of The Day today.DescriptionInternap Corpor provid inform technolog infrastructur services. It oper through two busi segments, Data Center Servic and Internet Protocol (IP) Services. The Data Center Servic segment provid coloc servic compris physic space within data center and associ services, such as power, interconnection, environment controls, monitoring, and security. Internap Corpor wa found in 1996 and is headquart in Atlanta, Georgia.Stick With What WorksTher is littl doubt that we are in a long term bull market. One of the best way to play thi market is by buy the stock that are see posit develop and are hit new highs. INAP ha both of these even and the market break a long streak of day without a 1% drawdown.Earn HistoryTh earn histori isn't exactli a stellar one. I see two beat and two miss in the last four outings. None of the last four report saw the compani outperform on the top line either. But someth did catch my eye.Th most recent report wa a beat of $0.03 which translat into a posit earn surpris of 20%. Thi solid beat caus the stock to jump more than 31% in the session follow the release. That ha a way of make the chart look great!EstimatesTh Zack Consensu Estim for CY2017 saw a huge boost follow the most recent earn report. The number move from a loss of $0.57 in Januari to a loss of $0.52 in Februari and is now at a loss of just $0.34. That is a big move in the right direction.Th CY18 number ha also seen a dramat move higher, go from a loss of $0.50 to a loss of $0.24 and settl at a loss of $0.16 over the same time period.If the compani continu to beat expectations, profit could come by the end of the year.ValuationWithout the benefit of posit earn we don't get to lean on the PE for our look at valuation. Instead we have to look at the conserv measur of price to book which ha the stock trade at a discount to the market. INAP trade at about 4x book, but the industri averag is trade closer to 6.5x. The more aggress measur of price to sale show the stock trade at 0.7x compar to a 6.2x industri average. Both of these metric show consider room for growth.Bear of the Day:GCP Appli Technologies( NYSE:GCP-Fre Report) is a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The compani ha miss the Zack Consensu Estim in each of the last three quarter and it is the Bear of the Day today.DescriptionGCP Appli Technolog Inc. offer specialti construct chemic and build materi as well as packag technologies.

The transact is expect to close in the middl of 2017.The sale of the busi like mean that estim will be chopped. The question is will the stock see a similar move when investor realiz that while GCP may be flush with cash the entir compani is trade at a valu of just over $2.3B at about $33 per share.Addit content:Twitt Bot Scandal Put Further Pressur on CEO DorseyJack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR-Fre Report)i face anoth problem in convinc advertis to return to Twitter, as new research show that up to 15% of Twitter' 319 million user can be bot rather than human.Th research wa conduct by Univers of Southern California and Indiana University.

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guid and stori teller for the fascin arena of Behavior Economics.Today we'r go to focu on the work of Dan Ariely, author ofPredict Irrational. When he publish the book in 2008, Ari wa a professor of Behavior Econom at MIT. Now, he' Professor of Psycholog and Behavior Econom at Duke Univers and he also is the founder of The Center for Advanc Hindsight. Ariely' TEDtalk have been watch over 7.8 million times.We'v talk befor about the cognit bia calledanchoring. Ari ha pick up where the forefath of Behavior Econom like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler left off by do new experi to find out how preval thi bia realli is.In the podcast, I read from Chapter 2 of Predict Irrational, titl ""The Fallaci of Suppli and Demand: Whi the Price of Pearl - and Everyth Els - Is Up in the Air.""Ari begin with a stori about the ""pearl king"" Salvador Assael who achiev a remark market feat in the 1970 New York luxuri jewelri scene by make so-cal black pearl from Tahiti into a nearli preciou gem.H tell thi stori to help explain the power ofpric anchorsin decis making, especi when the initi price refer is complet arbitrary, and thus, irrational.Then he describ an experi he conduct with colleagu at MIT in the first decad of the 21st century. The research use a class of 55 market MBA student to conduct a special auction where the particip were first ask to write down the last two digit of their social secur numbers.Th act of write down those digit had a surpris overal impact on the result of the auction, which includ fine wines, comput equipment, and chocolate. Listen to the podcast and hear me read an excerpt from Dan' book that I hope inspir you to read it yourself.Th GAF EconomyAriely' experi with price anchor and buy decis got me think about my favorit ""big brothers"" and hoarder of ton of data on consum buy behavior:Alphabet(GOOGL),Amazon(AMZN), andFacebook(FB).I bet Ari would love to have access to these databas for virtual unlimit testing. Note to self: see if Dan is look for research partner in thi ocean of data.Follow of my stock research and trade articl know that I often talk about The GAF Economi compris of Google, Amazon, and Facebook. My focu is on the behemoth who have chang our entertainment, education, shop and entrepreneurship with a digit delug of inform and market opportunities.Together, Googl and Facebook will break the $100 billion mark thi year in advertis revenu accord to market research firm eMarketer. Googl broke the $50 billion mark a few year ago and Facebook top $26 billion in 2016.Their combin 2017 haul will command over a 46% share of advertisers' total global digit ad spend. Just think about the volum of consum purchas trigger by that $100 billion in ad spend.And if you have been listen to me about digit advertis growth in the past year, you know that Facebook is not steal market share from Googl in that growth. Together, they are expand the pie as ton of small and medium-s busi realiz the power of digitally-target audienc and geographies, effici ad testing, and fine-tun of their ad budgets.Welcom to the JungleAnd in the ""retail rainforest"" that is Amazon, consum continu to adopt it conveni platform for more purchas -- at the expens of tradit retailers. Amazon' total annual revenu grew 27% last year to $136 billion as it wa respons for possibl one-fourth of all onlin transact in the US.Testifi to that reach, accord to web market servic provid BloomReach, 55% of consum start their product search on Amazon in 2016, up from 44% in 2015.And here are some amaz stat from Amazon' Q4 report...Fulfil by Amazon (FBA) deliv more than two billion unit on behalf of seller in 2016, and the number of activ seller use FBA grew more than 70%. Use the FBA service, Amazon seller from more than 130 countri fulfil order to custom in 185 countries.In 2016, there were over 100,000 seller with sale of more than $100,000 sell on Amazon.To help put Amazon' share of retail sale in some perspect - I say ""some"" becaus the compani doesn't break out their revenu clearli enough for us to know for sure -- let me share some paragraph from an Octob USA Today articl titledAmazon could be a lot bigger than we think...In the Unit States, total annual retail sale are about $5 trillion, with the Depart of Commerc estim 8% of that is e-commerce. That put total onlin sale at around $400 billion, and Amazon' share at 15% (for domest revenu only).Amazon' retail revenue, however, doesn't reflect the full valu of the item sold on Amazon by other retailers. These are compani that use Amazon as an onlin sale venue, sometim their onli one. Amazon say 49% of it unit sold come from third-parti sellers.Th compani may actual be handl doubl that amount - 20% to 30% of all U.S. retail good sold onlin - thank to the volum of sale it transact for third parti on it websit and app. Onli a portion of those sale add to it revenue.""Th punchlin is that Amazon' twice as big as peopl give them credit for, becaus there' thi iceberg under the surface, but you onli see the tip,"" said Scot Wingo, execut chairman of Channel Advisor, an e-commerc softwar compani that work with thousand of onlin sellers.When third-parti sale are taken into account, Amazon' share of what U.S. shopper spend onlin could be as high as $125 billion yearly, and it could repres close to 30% of the onlin good American buy, accord to an analysi of Amazon' financi statements.Gen Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray, estim Amazon touch 30% of total e-commerc in the Unit States, and it share is growing.""Amazon' just go to slowli grab more and more of your wallet,"" he said.Again, Dan Ari if you are listening, we need to studi the buy data and behavior of the GAF Economy. There must thousand of A/B split test just sit there wait with evid of how predict irrat we are.A Surprisingli Simpl Solut for ProcrastinationFinally, at the end of my podcast I introduc Ariely' latest book,Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shape Our Motivations. I share a product secret from Dan that could liter chang your life. It' a real golden nugget that will help you control, if not crush, procrastination. Or should I call it a black pearl?Mak the time to read Ariely' book.

AMD's (AMD) Success Is Not The Death Of Intel (INTC),3/22/2017,"My articl on Tuesday, which highlight (some might say “boasted”) the recent achiev of Advanc Micro Devic (AMD), wa perceiv by some reader as an attack on Intel (INTC). But that wa the intent.Whil I’m admittedli an unabash cheerlead of Intel, I can still appreci the rags-to-rich stori that AMD CEO Lisa Su ha success execut sinc her appoint in Januari 2012. AMD stock trade at $5.40 at the time. The stock recent made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the peopl at AMD headquarters, no one anticip thi remark turnaround. But what’ good for AMD is also good for Intel sinc a excit surround chip battl increas consum interest.Notably, thi renew battl come even as the rate of PC revenu continu to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggl at the height of the mobil era, have move beyond be just PC shops. And while AMD continu to make impress leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD push Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’ exactli what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich ha begun to demonstrate.makeArticleAd();Look to avoid the anoth mobile-typ miss, Intel is push heavili to be future-ready. Fresh off it second mega-d in less than two years, Krzanich — in hi fifth year at the helm — seem intent on put Intel’ cash to use. The company’s$15.3 billion acquisitionof Isra self-driv technolog compani Mobiley (MBLY) wa the most recent example. Thi follow $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.These two deal suggest that Intel is not worri about what AMD is doing. It can be argu that it should. But Krzanich, who ha found way to get Intel’ top line grow again, ha shown to have a good puls on what the compani needs. Not onli doe Intel, thank to Altera, now have an insid track on the Internet of Thing and data center market, Mobiley now put Intel in the driver' seat in the realm of autonom cars, allow it to better compet with Tesla (TSLA) and Googl (GOOGL).In both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unabl to immedi see the financi benefits, critic Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Googl wa laugh at for buy YouTub in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTub is worth anestim $40 billiontoday. Likewise, Facebook (FB) wa critic for take out Instagram. But assum Intel can realiz the estim $70 billion total address market of driverless car by 2030, Mobiley could prove to be a bargain.In short, AMD’ improv don’t spell the doom of Intel. The manag of both compani are execut on their state oper objectives. And both stock should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depend on where your allegi is."

But given it strong relationship with automak and design win pipeline, the possibl for deeper collaboration, lower cost of develop and other cost synergi as a result of the acquisition, it may be just what Intel need to battl the rapidli grow competition.Also, Mobileye' map and data are of strateg value, not onli becaus they are import build block of self-driv technology, but also becaus they will increas the valu of Intel' solutions.Pandora Launch On-Demand Music ServicePandora ha launch it long-await on-demand music stream servic call Pandora Premium for $9.99 a month, similar to other servic like Spotifi and Appl Music.Th company' ha a tier service, start with Pandora, an ad-support free radio servic that allow you to creat ""stations"" base on your prefer artists, song on genr with Pandora curat the playlist.

The just-launch Premium servic may not be a runaway success becaus those look for such a servic have most like shift to one of the other services.

If you'r drive to work and leav your car in a park garag all day, you'r realli not get the benefit of it be abl to navig and drive itself. They'r realli meant to be use to be drive all day long. And when you do that, you get a higher util out of the vehicle, and that realli bring the cost of them down. And you have power thing behind the scenes. You have neural networks, and all the chip that aren't realli cheap. Thi is realli the way that these are meant to be used, to be in fleets. Uber andHertzand all the larg fleet and self-driv taxi are realli aim to do this. As far as South by Southwest, you were ask some of the thing we learned, we found out that about half the world' popul is in citi today, and that' go to grow to about two-third by 2050. So, we'r go to be move from about 3.5 billion peopl in citi today to 7 billion within the next 30 year or so. And you can't just keep build out more and more suburb and highway and park garag as infrastructur to have thi mani peopl move into the cities. It need to be a better-design city. And I think we'r go to see self-driv car play a key role in how citi are actual design themselv to accommod for the popul boom.O'Reilly:Yeah, I rememb anoth Fool, Armun Asgari, he had that piec back in October,Th Race to Autonomy: An Investor' Guid to Self-Driv Cars. It' a bit of a read, but it wa awesome. And one of the thing that it' common sens that he point out is, the averag American famili own 2.2 cars, and it' a $30,000-$50,000 asset that is rapidli depreciating. Wouldn't it be nice to get some use out of that? Wouldn't it be nice if our citi weren't just these monolith of concret to park these thing that aren't be use 95% of the time? Did you see anyth hard or tangibl down at the confer there, on thi trend?Erickson:Ther were sessions. It wa more academic, as far as what we had seen at South by Southwest. In term of use cases, though, I think Singapor is one that we can keep an eye on, if you want to see thi in action right now. Singapore, of course, is a citi that like to monitor everything. There' no litter there. They'r realli crack down on onli smoke in certain areas. It' a veri oversight city, so, they'r realli ahead of the curv on monitor things. Even today, Sean, they have their analog for Uber. It' a compani call Grab, who' team up with anoth compani call NuTonomi that' alreadi got self-driv car navig around the city, pick peopl up, basic a taxi servic that is happen right now. There is an engin in the passeng seat just for the peac of mind for the riders. But they'r plan to have 100 driverless car within the next year. Thi is someth that' alreadi happen out there -- you can actual get into a car that' navig itself to the locat for you.O'Reilly:Throughout Singapore, yeah. Can I ask what kind of car is it? I know that Uber wa test driverless car in Pittsburgh, and I believ they were Volvo crossov SUV or something. Do you know ani of that stuff off the top of your head?Erickson:Yeah, it is Volvo for the U.S. for Uber for self-driv cars. There' also a compani call Otto for self-driv trucks, which could be for transport.O'Reilly:Wow. I have to go to my local Volvo dealership and see if they have an engin sit around that can take me out on one of these things.Erickson:I have a crazi futurist idea for you, also.O'Reilly:I thi better than the driverless luggage?Erickson:It is. And you knew, when you invit me on the show, be anExplorer, futurist kind of guy, that I wa go to have to throw some idea like thi to you, right?O'Reilly:I'm all ears.Erickson:Th econom are such that the averag taxi fare, in the U.S., is charg about $3.50 a mile. Pretti expensive. And it' gener accept that by 2021, when we'r expect autonom vehicl to realli start go mainstream, that the cost of an autonom car will cost in the neighborhood of $0.30 a mile. Less than a tenth of the cost today. Now, when you get to that kind of price point, Sean, that open up a lot of option of who is actual pay $0.30 a mile per trip for customers. And the idea would be, thi can be subsid by advertis compani like Google, where you can get into an autonom car. Yeah. Get in for a free ride. It'll bring you within a 10-mile radius, or whatev the distanc would be. It'll cost Googl mayb $3 for your trip, at $0.30 a mile. But in exchange, they have your undivid attent that they can serv you ad in the car.O'Reilly:Oh, my gosh. I mean, I would obvious just look at my phone or read a book. But that' awesome.Erickson:Yeah, especi when you consid the number that you threw out earlier. The averag American is spend a third of their household incom everi year on these rapidli depreci asset that we call cars. It doesn't have to be that way when you start get into the discuss of $0.30 a mile.Suzann Frey, an execut at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool' board of directors.Simon Ericksonha no posit in ani stock mentioned.Sean O'Reillyha no posit in ani stock mentioned.

The compani is essenti transit from the utility-scal project-build busi to suppli pre-engin solut to developers, like utilities. The strategi make sense, but we had yet to see much indic that it wa take hold in the market... until thi week.SunPow sign a 125 MW suppli agreement withNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) to provid it P-Seri modul to the develop between June and Octob of thi year. There wasn't ani disclosur about whether the deal includ the Oasi track system or ani design services, but even if it' just a panel suppli agreement, it would be a posit sign.If deal like thi continu to come through in 2017 and SunPow is abl to suppli panel and other servic to develop on short lead times, it would be an immens posit development. One deal isn't a confirm that the P-Series/Oasi strategi is a success, but it' a step in the right direct for SunPow shareholders.Googl take Sunroof nationwideAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl subsidiari start the Project Sunroof initi in 2015 to tri to give custom and instal an easi view of the solar potenti of home around the country.

Thi week, that happened.Project Sunroofnow allow peopl across the countri to quickli view an outlin of their home' solar potential, and get an idea of what a solar system might cost them. Instal can be plug into the search to make sale easier, and I would expect some will even use it as a tool to target sale opportunities.

The $11.60-per-shar offer made by a group led by the CEO look to be on shakier ground late last year as solar panel price plung and demand in the solar market declined, particularli in China.I question whether or not the deal would go through given the question histori of Chines buyout offer and the declin in the market overall. But Trina Solar is now private, and the fact that the deal went through may mean manag see a brighter futur than mani investor current do.Takeaway from earn seasonEarn season is about over for the solar industry, and afterJA Solar(NASDAQ: JASO) andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR)report thi week,ther were a few major takeaway from the end of 2016 and earli 2017.Chines solar panel manufactur are down, but not out.

The great news is that oper have maintain a strong level of perform for sever year in a row.U.S. Concret notch $75 million in oper incom and $1.17 billion in revenu in 2016. Those metric grew 235% and 95%, respectively, from the perform achiev three year ago. Oper cash flow reach $112 million last year, which wa well abov the $24 million achiev in 2013.In other words, the stock ha certainli earn it 181% gain in the last three years.USCRdata byYCharts.That said, there' a strong case to be made that the company' growth isn't over. Unlik other cement and concret manufacturers, U.S. Concret ha strateg (and almost exclusively) focus on major metropolitan area in Texas, New York/New Jersey, and northern California. Those market were respons for 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of total revenu in 2016. There are sever advantag to that strategi that short-sel may be overlooking.First, it allow the compani to strateg acquir asset to becom a major and domin player in each region and city. Consid that in 2016 alone, U.S. Concret acquir four smaller ready-mix concret oper in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The acquisit provid the compani with 10 ready-mix concret plant and 189 mixer trucks. In addit to swipe away competition, the acquisit allow the compani to make more competit bid on larger projects. And in New York City, there are some pretti big projects.In fact, the compani suppli the concret that built the new World Trade Center Complex, includ Freedom Tower, which wa the highest height concret ha ever been pump in North America. Expans at LaGuardia Airport and the Modern Museum of Art were also aid by the company, as are other major ongo project in the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Francisco metropolitan areas.Second, extend it leadership posit in each major market allow U.S. Concret to have a greater influenc on product pricing. The fourth quarter of 2016 mark the 23rd straight quarter that the compani achiev year-over-year ready-mix concret price increases. That ha an obvious benefici impact on revenu and margins, and it ha play a huge role in the company' industry-lead margin in the ready-mix concret segment. Wherea the averag materi spread margin in the industri wa 45% last year, U.S. Concret achiev 49.2%.U Industri Production: Cementdata byYCharts.Third, oper in urban environ allow the compani to benefit from environment consider and initiatives, such as LEED build certifications. Human manufactur more cement than ani other material. Unfortunately, cement is also one of the most carbon-intens materi to produce, account for 5% oftot global CO2 emissionseach year. While certain materi can be substitut into cement product processes, they can significantli alter the perform of mix concrete. In other words, it' not easi be green.Luckily, U.S. Concret is a lead produc of low CO2 concrete. The company' EF Technolog can reduc the greenhous ga emiss associ with cement product by between 42% and 46%. Today, over 30% of concret use by the compani benefit from the technology. That allow it to place highli competit bid on major construct project with LEED requir -- an increasingli import consideration. That' especi true in environment consciou San Francisco, where the compani ha won project includ the Googl Bayview Campus, the Workday Campus, and even the Golden State Warrior Arena.What doe it mean for investors?It take a bit of dig around the company' primari strategi and the drive forc for the industri at large, but I think short-sel are wrong about thi stock. The onli way short-sel could be right about U.S. Concret stock is if the American economi head for a slowdown, which would have much broader consequences. While that' not imposs -- in fact, with recess occur everi eight year or so, we'r ""due"" for one -- it' unlik to sneak up on investors. The compani work off of a backlog of project that are agre to year prior, which provid fair warn to sharehold of potenti troubl on the horizon.

3 Companies Set to Make a Killing From Driverless Cars,3/17/2017,"Driverless car technolog is still in it nascent stage but will grow in leap and bound in the come years. IH Automot forecast that autonom vehicl sale will shoot up from 600,000 unit in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clock a compound annual growth rate of 43%.The Boston Consult Group, meanwhile, expect the driverless car market to creat a $42 billion revenu opportun in 2025 itself, indic that there is a lot of money to be made in thi space. One of the way to tap thi huge opportun is through technolog provid such asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-crit role in enabl autonom cars.NVIDIA' GPU are boost self-driv technologyNVIDIA is best known for make game graphic cards, but it product are in high demand from automak as well.Tesla, for instance, is use the chipmaker' artifici intelligence-bas DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X cars. What' more, the automak is also go to deploy NVIDIA' supercomput in it mass-market Model 3.makeArticleAd();Th Tesla partnership is alreadi deliv results, as NVIDIA' automot revenu shot up over 37% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter. The compani could sustain it automot momentum, as it is work with German giant Audi to bring a Level 4 autonom car to the market by 2020. Level 4 mean it can drive itself entir on it own.Th two compani showcas an Audi Q7 at CE earlier thi year, claim that the car learn to drive on it own in just four day use NVIDIA' AI-bas DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More importantly, NVIDIA is look to push the envelope: It' now work on a more advanc supercomput platform -- Xavier -- that consum less power but pack more comput capacity.NVIDIA' graphic process unit acceler the process of huge amount of data in real time, allow the vehicl to make quick decisions. As the compani increasingli turn it attent toward make it self-driv supercomput better through partnership with big auto companies, it won't be surpris if it platform end up power fulli autonom car by 2020.NVIDIA, therefore, look right on the edg of tap the driverless car opportunity, as 80 compani are use the DRIVE PX2 platform to develop their technology.Microsoft' big data opportunityDriverless cars, or ani connect car for that matter, will gener huge volum of data from their sensor and camera that will need storag and processing.

Now, all thi data can't be store on the car itself due to limit storag capacity, creat an opportun for Microsoft to push it cloud product to automakers.TheRenault-Nissanalli ha alreadi decid to use the softwar giant' connect vehicl platform, pledg to put 10 car with autonom technolog on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian automakerTata Motorsi adopt the platform to bring connect featur and predict mainten at afford price to mass-market vehicl in India.Microsoft is also find demand for it connect car platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsur provid Swiss Re will analyz drive behavior with the help of the telemat data collect by the cloud, and then creat custom insur deal for customers.Th inevit data increas from driverless and connect car could power Microsoft' Azur cloud busi to new high in the long run, allow it to sustain rapid revenu growth from thi segment.Imag source: Waymo.Alphabet' Waymo moonshot could be a big businessAlphabet' Waymo divis ha thebest driverless cartechnology, accord to data from the California DMV.

4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangs,3/17/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh so-cal ""FANG stocks"" have been an incredibly-wel perform group. For those who don't know, FANG consist ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) - formerli Google.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhi ha thi group been so successful? Despit a few of them sport lofti valuations, they are the respect king of their industries. Facebook domin social media, Netflix own streaming, Amazon is the king of e-commerc and Googl own the onlin search engine.Ov the past five years, Alphabet is the worst perform of the FANG stocks, return ""just"" 180%. After that, it' Facebook, which ha gener 265%. Amazon' 360% return stand out and Netflix' 830% gain jump off the page. Have these stock gone too far, though?7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeI wouldn't necessarili argu that. Some name warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let' take a further look to see which stock are worth hold onto and which are worth take profit in.FANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)Source:Th Crunchies! via FlickrWe'l keep the FANG stock in order, so let' begin withFacebook. Facebook ha impress captiv billion of user through it platform. At last check, Facebook cater to 1.23 billion daili activ users, an 18% increas year-over-year. Monthli activ user of 1.86 billion increas 17% year-over-year.Even more impressively, Facebook ha found a way to grow it revenu growth. That may seem like a typo, but it' not. FB ha manag to not onli grow sale on a year-over-year basis, but also acceler that rate of growth as well. After impress grow sale in the 40% to 49% rang through fiscal 2015, FB ha now manag 50%+ revenu growth for five consecut quarters. Obvious the compani hasfound a way to continu growand it user are not tire of it variou ad formats.FB stock is not egregi price either; with a forward price-earn ratio of just 21, Facebook share are not that expens with earn per share expect to grow 28.1% thi year and 23.4% next year.Throw in the fact that Facebook ha top earn expect over the past 13 quarter and the stock becom even more attractive. Share have been on a tear thi year. But a pullback to it 50-day move averag near $131 could be a buy opportunity.FANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockAMZN stockha also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decay retail sector and Amazon' abil to capit on that weakness. But judg the futur of commerc can be difficult, especi with how quickli Amazon continu to move.Th biggest concern for Amazon skeptic ha been earnings. Despit year of 20%-plu revenu growth, AMZN' bottom line ha hug the flatline. Manag argu that it' invest in itself for even more growth and so far, investor have been patient. They'v also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, share are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon start to pad it bottom line with it Web Servic cloud business.Whil I person love Amazon, I would be a bit leeri of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast thing can chang with sentiment. In the begin of 2016, AMZN stock stumbl from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startl plenti of investors, despit the stock rebound to north of $800 a share within a year.Th lesson here is simple: Amazon share are not invinc dure pullbacks. Should we get a notabl broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time tobuy the stock. Now that it' through the holiday season andcontinu to invest at a heavi pace, share could struggl in the intermedi term.7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeA declin to it 200-day move averag would be a great place to initi a long position. That mark is current near $780 per share. Ani further declin could be use to accumul the stock.FANG Stocks:Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixNFLX stocki one a lot of investor are kick themselv over. Share languish below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some fear higher content cost and sloppi oversea execution.Thos fear still exist to some point, but Netflix ha shown better execut as of late. As a result, share have catapult to north of $140. The stock ha been consolid nice around thi level. With the 50-day move averag just below, it appear Netflix may be set up for amov to new all-tim highs.Investor who want to buy now could use the 50-day move averag - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possibl declin to it 200-day move average, current just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investor may consid initi a posit in the name, with a plan to purchas more on addit declines.Th problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not mani investor question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which hold a domin posit in the stream world. I consid Netflix a veri battleground-bas stock. On the one hand, it' trail P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of it five-year range. On the other hand, it forward P/E ratio is the lowest it' been in the same time frame.Th stream offer from Alphabet' YouTube, as well asHulucould also be a concern. For now, the bull seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix' execut deterior or competit eat into it growth, the narr may change. But for now, stay long Netflix seem like it will work.FANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockLik Facebook, one of the main attract toAlphabeti actual the valuation. Trade at 21.8 time next year' earnings, share of Alphabet aren't price too expensive. Analyst expect GOOGL to churn out earn growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earn growth over the next five years.Alphabet' founder may have pave the way for internet domination. But there' a new team member to it C-suit that ha given GOOGL a much-need boost. CFO Ruth Porat join the compani in May 2015.In the year lead up to her hire, share had been stagnant, return just 5%. Sinc her addition, though, the stock is up a whop 60%. Doe it also seem like a coincid that Alphabet miss analysts' estim on at least six straight quarter prior to her arrival? Sinc then, Alphabet ha top estim in five of the past six quarters.Admittedly, Alphabet' transpar ha been better, make it easier for analyst to form estimates. But thi ad clariti make it easier on investor and help lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet take some gambles. For instance, consid Alphabet' self-driv car unit, Waymo. Porat ha not stifl thi growth. Rather, she ha reign in expens and channel GOOGL' focus. As a result, the bottom line ha improved,without futur potenti be eliminated.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashWith a consist core busi in Googl and potenti upsid in busi like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With it depend growth and a reason valuation, it' even better. At just a hair under all-tim highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of it 50-day move averag near $840 and a further declin to it 200-day move averag near $800 would offer better entri opportunities.A of thi writing, Bret Kenwel did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Th post4 Famou Tech Stock That Could Lose Their Fangsappear first onInvestorPlace."

5 Signs Snap Inc's High Growth Days are Over,3/17/2017,"Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , the parent compani of Snapchat, made it public debut on March 3, and the result were underwhelming. Snap made it public debut at $17, surg to nearli $30 on the first day, then tumbl back to just over $20 in less than two weeks.Whi did investor seemingli snub Snap, which some bull have hail as the ""nextFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ""? The answer is simpl -- six red flag indic that the stock could slide much lower befor it' consid a bargain.Snap' Android app. Imag source: Googl Play.makeArticleAd();1. Slow user growthTh declin ofTwitter' (NYSE:TWTR) stocktaught usthat social network live and die by their activ user growth. Without activ user growth, advertis start skip the platform in favor of faster grow ones. Snapchat' daili activ user (DAUs) rose just 3% sequenti to 158 million last quarter, compar to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17% growth in the second quarter.That slowdown wa like caus by the launch of new Snapchat-lik featur for Facebook' Instagram and Messeng app -- which includ Instagram Stories, vanish Instagram photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messeng Day app which delet photo and video after 24 hours. Instagram Stories, in particular, grew it DAU from 100 million to 150 million between last Octob and thi January.2. It cash burn rateSnap' S-1 file reveal that it finish fiscal 2016 with just $150.1 million in cash and equival -- a 77% declin from $640.8 million at the end of 2015. The compani had a neg oper cash flow of $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and it burn through $1.14 in cash for each dollar in gener revenue.Snap will retain $2.3 billion of the $3.2 billion it rais dure it IPO. That amount will help Snap tread water for a while, but it might not last long if it cash burn rate accelerates. Susquehanna analyst believ that Snap won't achiev posit free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that estim could be far too optimist if rival like Instagram Stori continu throttl Snapchat' growth.3. Widen lossesSnap' revenu surg 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on the bottom line, it net losswidenedfrom $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company' biggest expens includ multi-billion dollar cloud contract withAlphabet' Googl andAmazon.If Snap can't narrow it loss with such massiv revenu growth, thing could getveryugli onc it top line growth slow down. Snap ha also warn in it SEC file that it ""may never achiev or maintain profitability.""4. Unrealist revenu growth targetsSnap claim that it can gener $500 million to $1 billion in revenu in 2017. That' a veri wide range, but analyst are model their forecast on the high-end, with an averag estim of $1.04 billion. However, it' unclear how Snap plan to hit that target.Th three type of Snap ads. Imag source: Snap.96% of Snap' revenu came from advertis in 2016. Snap' ad product includ full-screen video ads, sponsor geofilters, and sponsor lenses. If Snap' user growth peaks, it could possibl boost it number of market partner to gener higher ad revenu per customer. But more than doubl it 2016 revenu to $1 billion in 2017 seem like ahugestretch.Research firm eMarket recent trim it 2017 ad revenu forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770 million. That reduct wa modest, but it indic that analyst aren't certain that it can hit it ambiti growth targets.5. It think it' a ""camera company""Co-found and CEO Evan Spiegel ha repeatedli declar that Snap is differ from other social network becaus it' a ""camera company."" Tthat statement sound reason becaus it produc special filter and lens for smartphon cameras, but rival like Instagram can easili make similar claims.Snap' Spectacles. Imag source: Snap.Spiegel didn't say that Snap would sell physic camera anytim soon, but the compani launch it Spectacl Snap-captur glass late last year. The devic attract lot of shoppers, thank to a clever market campaign featur vanishingvend machines.If Snap build upon that idea, it could start sell other cheap imag captur devic to build it brand and differenti itself from Instagram. However, that move could caus it to burn through it cash even faster and weigh down it bottom line with a low-margin hardwar business.Should you avoid Snap?Snap look like a compani that went public befor it form a coher roadmap toward posit cash flow and profitability. Without the abil to reach those goals, Snap remain an incred overvalu stock at nearli 60 time sales.To put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/ ratio of about 10 at the close of it first trade day. Twitter end it first day with a P/ ratio of about 11. Thi mean that Snap could easili plummet to the singl digit if investor realiz that thi ephemer emperor ha no clothes.10 stock we like better than Snap Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why This Market Researcher Lowered Its Revenue Expectations for Snap,3/16/2017,"Analyst haven't been kind toSnap(NYSE: SNAP) sinc it made it IPO. Not one analyst ha given Snap stock a buy rating, and share have fallen consider from it open price at the begin of the month.Most recently, market research eMarket lower it expect for Snap' U.S. ad revenu from $800 million to $770 million. The reason behind the lower estim is ""higher-than-estim revenu share with partners.""Snapchat offer revenu share as an incent for content publish to use it Publish Stori (formerli Discover) format. Snap is also partner with variou media compani to produc origin shows, which may provid even more favor revenu share for the content producer.makeArticleAd();Let' take a look at how revenu share affect Snap' financials.Imag source: Snap/Author.Revenu share doesn't impact Snap' top lineWhil eMarket is lower it expect for Snapchat, the actual declin in net ad revenu won't show up in Snap' top line. Snap report gross revenu similarli to howAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) report Google' revenue. Googl lump in revenu from it network partner with it search and YouTub revenue, and then account for revenu share as part of it traffic acquisit costs.Th amount of revenu Snap share with it publish partner is then report as an item in the company' cost of revenue. So, eMarket may have well said it expect Snap' cost of revenu to come in $30 million higher than origin anticipated.Snap' Publish Stories. Imag source: Snap.Last year, Snap say revenu share payment increas $48.2 million from 2015, but it doesn't provid a specif amount it paid to partners. That doe at least provid a floor, and it' nearli 12% of Snap' $404.5 million in total revenu last year.For comparison, Googl paid out $10.9 billion in revenu share to it network partner (not includ YouTube) in 2016. That' almost 14% of it total ad revenu for the year.Revenu share may increas even fasterWhil most analyst expect Snap to grow it top line to around $1 billion thi year, it path to that mark may mean less of that revenu make it past the second line (cost of revenue) on it incom statement. Snap ha ink sever high-profil deal with media compani over the last year.It alreadi ha deal in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produc origin show for Snapchat. Snap is still activ pursu these high-profil deals.It' import to note that Snap say it revenue-shar arrang ""gener do not contain minimum financi commit to our publish partner and are gener not tie to specif event or promotions."" That seem to indic Snap doesn't pay anyth up front for these productions, but Snap may help out with the cost as ""content creation costs"" also show up in management' descript of cost of revenue. Content creation cost includ personnel-rel costs, accord to Snap' S-1.With the growth of the Publish Stori platform, investor should expect a stark increas in cost of good sold due to revenue-shar and content-cr costs.Cost of revenu is alreadi under scrutinySnap post a neg gross margin last year as it cost of revenu overshadow it revenue. The biggest factor behind it is Snap' host expenses, for which it primarili reli on Googl Cloud. It' alreadi commit to spend $3 billion in total on cloud infrastructur over the next five years, which will continu to put pressur on Snap' gross margin as it tri to scale.Add to that the fact that one of it revenu driver is grow content from publish partners, which contribut to even more cost of revenue. While a few ten of million of dollar is rel small compar to the hundr of million Snap is spend with it cloud partner each year, Snap' margin are so thin that everi dollar counts.10 stock we like better than Snap Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That be said, Intel' cash flow-gener capabl are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of it debt will matur in 2022 or later, Intel could easili eras the major of it leverag in a singl year, even after subtract the $9.6 billion it spent on capit expenditur in 2016.Intel is also an exampl of a compani that use debt, or a leverag capit structure, as a sourc of competit advantage. It' one of the few semiconductor compani that also own it chip fabric plants; NVIDIA outsourc it fab to a consortium of partner includingTaiwan Semiconductor,Samsung, and more.

Either way, both compani are in fine financi shape, given their respect strategies, so let' call thi one a tie and move on.Winner: Tie.Imag source: Getti Images.Dur competit advantagesNVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaning competit advantag in their respect area of the global semiconductor market.Sourc estim Intel control 87% of the PC CPU market and 95% the server CPU market, although the exact number aren't as import as know that Intel domin the global PC and data center microprocessor markets, and for a predict reason: Intel' longtim perform advantag over the competit -- namely,Advanc Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) -- ha allow the compani to charg higher price per unit for it chips.Intel plow an aggress portion of it profit back into it research and development, which has, in turn, allow it to maintain the perform advantag of it chips.

In contrast, Intel' research-and-develop budgetaloneha total $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over the same period. Thi kind of structur advantag is incred difficult to overcome.NVIDIA' competit advantag are more technolog than structur at the moment. Becaus of it long-stand place as the creator graphic computing, on which it still focuses, NVIDIA' chip have gener been the best of breed in each of the graphic process applic it product serve.

The multipl trend fuel NVIDIA' growth should support it earn growth for arguabl a decad or more, so it sky-high valuat shouldn't be a deterr for investor with a similarli long time horizon.A more of a matur company, Intel will have it invest outlook driven by it abil to grow it EP and return excess capit to shareholders.

Loath aside, heavi debt and a burdensom Valeant stock chart suggest bears, not bull or pig are still in control of VRX.makeArticleAd();Lov him or hate him (and most arguabl seem to dislik Bill Ackman), now is not the time to bet against the hedg fund manag and activist investor by pick up Valeant stock.Aft a veri long, pain and much-public campaign in share of VRX, Bill Ackman announc thi past Monday night, hi hedg fund Persh Squar ha exit Valeant Pharmaceuticals.Th invest inVRX ha been more than an eyesorefor the stori hedg fund manager. Over the past two years, Valeant stock ha tank nearli 95% from the firm' initi purchas price of $190 to $11 a share. Even worse, exit VRX requir a massiv liquid of some 27 million shares. What' more, the Valeant stake repres Persh Square' most concentr bet and onli magnifi the loss, both on and off paper, for Bill Ackman.But love him or hate him, think hi company' capitul in Valeant stock, which admittedli requir a ""disproportionately"" larg amount of firm' resources, mean VRX is now free to rally; think again.10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashTh fact of the matter is Persh Squar decis onli came after a substanti year-long commit to help Valeant sell key assets, establish a new manag team and overhaul of the company' board. As well and despit those efforts, there remain $30 billion in under-fund debt obligations.Bottom line, if a stori hedg fund with an otherwis veri enviabl record of success over the past coupl decad can't justifi stay the course, though they do have to answer to their dwindl invest base; it' time to face the truth of an equal problemat chart in Valeant stock.Val Stock Daili ChartLook at the daili chart of VRX and it' obvious, to us at least, there have been occas over the past year where Valeant share deserv the benefit of the doubt - and even offer decent size, short-term trade profit to bulls.At thi point in time though, and without be too pessimistic, it would be hard to defend VRX stock. On a technic basi thi week' latest tumbl put share at multiyear low and point toward the financi crisi low of $6.65 - and to be quit honest, mayb much lower in 2017.VRX Stock Bearish Combo SpreadIn review the VRX option board and with share at $10.96, I like the idea of creat a bearish modifi spread. One combo of interest is sell the April $11/$12.50 call vertic and purchas the April $10 put for even money.If Valeant stock disappoint thi bearish trader, the worst case scenario is a loss of $1.50 abov $12.50 at expiration. That would requir a complet revers of thi week' bearish gap.How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High YieldLook optimist lower on the price chart, if VRX share remain wedg between $10 and below $11 a share at expiration, both part of the combo go out worthless and the trader break even. However, an interim move toward the held put could produc paper profits. The posit doe maintain a bearish delta, or direct bias, when there' still time on the calendar prior to expiration.Lastly, if VRX stock drop below $10, the combin would begin to trade just like short stock, but without the open-end risk of that type of position. If that were to happen, I'd look to close the bear call spread and sell a portion of the long put inventori for even money.

"Better Buy: Facebook, Inc. vs. Line Corp.",3/16/2017,"They were the largest tech IPO in the respect year they went public. They compet head-to-head in what mani expect to emerg as an increasingli import area of consum tech in come years. They'r social-media powerhouseFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and messag platformLin Corporation(NYSE: LN) .Line made it public debut last July, so the sampl size of it trade histori is minuscule. However, in the month sinc it IPO, the respect fortun of Line and Facebook have diverg to a meaning degree.makeArticleAd();LNdata byYChartsOf course, thi onli tell ani investor a fraction of what he or she need to know. Let' examin three import aspect of Facebook' and Line' invest narratives, to figur out which stock is the better buy today.Financi fortitudeTh comparison of financi might between Line and Facebook is an instanc of David versu Goliath. Look at these four import measur of solvenc and liquid for both companies:CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioFacebook$29.4 billion$0$16.1 billion11.9Lin Corp$1.2 billion$0$253.4 billion2.0Data sources: Facebook and Line Corp. investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.Facebook win each categori by a landslide, but Line is in fine financi shape. It ha no debt, ha over $1 billion in the bank, and produc plenti of spare cash each year. However, the winner here wa inevitable.Winner: Facebook.Imag source: Getti Images.Dur competit advantagesTh size contrast between Facebook and Line continu in examin their durabl competit advantages.A of it most recent earn report, Facebook count 1.86 billion monthli activ user (MAUs) on it core social-network platform, or about 58% of the world' popul that ha access to the internet. Beyond this, Facebook own other social-media platform and messag services, such as Instagram (600 million MAUs), Facebook Messeng (1 billion MAUs), and WhatsApp (1 billion MAUs), that are see larg and grow user count as well. Thi immens base of user ha allow Facebook to creat the most power digit advertis thi side ofAlphabet. Better still, Facebook is move into emerg area of technology, includ virtual reality, artifici intelligence, live digit video streaming, and much more. Facebook, in short, ha quickli ascend to becom one of the most import technolog compani on the face of the earth.Line, on the other hand, is far smaller. As of it most recent earn report, the compani count 217 million monthli activ user on it messag platform, though 76% of it user are concentr in just four core markets: Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Worse, it user growth declin sequenti from 220 million in it Q3 report, suggest that Line may be feel pressur from larger global messag platform -- like the one Facebook owns. The compani ha move aggress to monet it user through product such as paid stickers, games, and a host of other mobil apps, but the juri remain out on whether Line can translat it region strength in messag into a sustain long-term business. Compar with Facebook, it' clear which compani enjoy more substanti durabl competit advantages.Winner: Facebook.ValuationA meaning gap exist between Facebook' and Line' valuations, and for good reason. First, look at three of the most commonli use valuat metric for both companies:CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAFacebook39.120.424.7Lin Corp.111.834.634.3Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Again, Facebook beat Line across all three valuat statistics. Compar thi perform to their project futur growth rates, analyst estim that Facebook' earn per share will grow at an averag annual rate of 23.5% over the next five years, versu 39.3% for Line -- which ha onli one sell-sid analyst cover it stock at the moment. I think the key question here is to what extent investor believ in Line' monet capabilities. If Line can inde grow it EP at such above-averag rates, Line share could do quit well. However, the crack that have emerg in it user growth stori give me pause. So let' call thi section a draw and move on.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... FacebookFacebook remain undeni stronger than Line, even factor in Line' higher estim futur growth rates. The Asian messag platform still ha plenti of question to answer about whether it can continu to expand it uses. On the other hand, Facebook is one of the most power and icon compani in all of tech.

"Sound The Alarm, ALRM is Headed Higher",3/15/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();Get readi for some upward revis to the earn estim ofAlarm.com( ALRM). The stock is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) right now but report earn after the close on Wednesday, March 15. The compani post revenu of $69.79M compar to the consensu of $63.95M. EP of $0.19 wa $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensu estimate.In the release, the compani guid Wall Street higher. FY2017 is now expect to produc revenu of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfort higher than the $300M consensu estimate. The compani expect to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also abov the $0.65 consensu estimate.In late after hour trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estim Like Move HigherWhen a compani rais guidanc over the consensu you can expect the analyst to adjust their models. These model help them deriv their earn estim which are use in the Zack Rank. Sinc there haven't been ani earn revis over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). In the come day I anticip the stock to see sever upward revis which should help boost the Zack Rank for thi stock to a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisit and they were touch on dure the confer call. Dure the call, manag talk about how the ObjectVideo acquisit will allow custom to track car and licens plate or even custom in a store.Th Icontrol Network deal close in the quarter and the compani mention how the Piper unit power a portion of the ADT platform. The industri had been view as ""we versu ADT"" but that ha chang with the advent of custom home protect servic offer by cabl companies.An analyst question if the compani wa look to a product offer around cars, and while the compani would not commit on a specif answer, it wa clear that it could be someth come down the road. Mani time dure the call manag note that they were maintain a healthi level of spend for R&D. Have an expand platform is key becaus the secur busi ha been chang veri rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookA we think about the chang in home security, it is clear that peopl are ad devic and servic thank to the rel eas of the internet. Manag note on the call that peopl want these product and servic to come from one source.A an example, I have a Googl Cam (formerli Dropcam) and while it is access via it own app I would like to see it be usabl via my Amazon echo. Ye the Googl Nest is control via the voic recogn tool, but I would like more functionality. I often search on Amazon for devic that are compat with Alexa sinc I have power out that is control by anoth company. It too ha it own app and with onli a few devic have multipl app is alreadi a pressur point for me.With the strong revenu guidance, manag believ that it product and servic will be well receiv by customers.Analyst Note ComingA I look at where most recommend are, I see a few potenti upgrad tomorrow. Goldman Sach start coverag of the stock with a Neutral rate on Januari 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm ask about the potenti for organ growth from Icontrol which allow manag to talk about how they were go to hold their cost structur constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translat to better than 20% margin. It is possibl that Goldman Sach up the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.Raymond Jame downgrad the stock back on August 16 as the move their rate to Market Perform from Outperform. Imperi Capit ha the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.Roth Capit start coverag on Octob 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target. Don't be surpris to see that price target move to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initi with a buy rate and $37 price target on Decemb 1. They are clearli the most bullish on the stock and for good reason. I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recent post results.Trad Range?Th stock ha a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surpris to see a new level reach tomorrow. Whi do I say this? Well back on Octob 31, 2016 some unusu call buy wa spot in ALRM. The call wa a $35 strike with a March expiration. At the time, the stock wa $29 and chang so it wa a pretti big reach. I see those same call close at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anyth to get too excit about.What did catch my eye on the option chain wa all the put that move the day of earnings. The 27.5 strike that expir on Friday saw 729 contract vs open interest of 898. Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium seller as the put wa pay $0.42.I like the chanc of sever price target increas come tomorrow. There is an outsid chanc we get an upgrad on the stock as well. Throw in the idea that some mildli aggress call were bought sever month ago I and I like the chanc of thi stock trade over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter. Either way, look for thi stock to becom a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusAlarm.com Holdings, Inc.

The compani pull off it offer in June at $15 a share and within a few months, the price hit a nose-ble $69. But then there wa an avalanch of sell with Twilio stock. As of now, the price is at $31.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrDespit all this, TWLO ha continu to grow at a rapid pace. In the latestquarter, the revenu jump by 60% to $82 million, as the number of activ custom account went from 34,457 to 36,606.In fact, Twilio beat the Street consensus. The compani also forecast that the growth ramp would continu throughout the year.But it wa not enough to get TWLO stock back into gear. For the most part, Twilio stock ha been trade in a tight range.So might there be an opportunity? Perhap TWLO stock ha bottom out and is pois for a move on the upside? Well, to see, let' take a look at three pro and three cons:Thre Pro to Twilio StockPow Platform: TWLO ha a suit of power cloud-bas applications, allow for SMS, chat, voic call and video. A develop can easili emb thi technolog into an app, provid access to a sophist commun network.7 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are Actual SafeTh busi model is also enticing. That is, payment are onli requir when there is usag of the Twilio service.A a result, the compani ha been abl to quickli attract developers. Note that there are over 1 million accounts.Go Upmarket: TWLO ha an Enterpris Plan, which is focus on larg custom that have tough requir for compliance, secur and administration. A key part of thi wa the recent grant of ISO 27001 certification, which is a global standard for security.Whil still in the earli stages, the Enterpris Plan is show encourag results. For example, in the latest quarter TWLO snag a major airlin as well asCapit One Financi Corp. (NYSE:COF) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.Accord to CEO Jeff Lawson, on the most recentearn call: ""We are see realli good respons in term of the enterprise. Again, I would say thi is our develop first model at play where develop are the one bring Twilio into the enterpris just like they'v brought us into a number of differ type of technolog first companies.""Growth Opportunity: Compani like Uber,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have rais the bar when it come to app and cloud technologies. Custom have come to expect that they can get quick servic with just a few taps.Thi is where TWLO is so powerful. The company' system can easili allow for must-hav featur to remain competitive.So in light of this, it should be no surpris that the market opportun for Twilio stock is enormous. Accord toresearch from IDC, it' estim at about $45.4 billion.Thre Con to Twilio StockCompetition: It' certainli fierce. Just some of the rival includeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),Vonag Hold Corp.(NYSE:VG), CallFire, Nexmo and Bandwidth.com. In fact, some of TWLO' own custom could wind up be competitors, such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). And telecom oper likeAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andVerizon Commun Inc.(NYSE:VZ) could leverag their own network to take on TWLO.Granted, the low-pric strategi of the compani ha probabl been a key in maintain marketshare. But then again, thi may make it tough for it to ultim get to profit on a GAAP basis.Custom Concentration: It is fairli heavy. Last year about 30% of revenu came from onli 10 customers. Keep in mind that FB' WhatsApp repres 9% and Uber wa over 10%. It' import to note that TWLO also gener allow custom to termin their contract at ani time.What Will Appl Inc.

Let' face it, larg compani can certainli leverag their power to exact better terms, especi when there are altern available.Valuation: Even with the plung in Twilio stock, the multipl is still at hefti levels. Note that the price-to-sal ratio is roughli 10X.

Don’t Follow Warren Buffett Into Apple Inc.

But Buffett himself take a differ approach by buy individu stocks, such asAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). The question is: Should you do as Buffett say and index, or do as Buffettdoes, and buy AAPL stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBuffett' lack of technolog exposur is well-known among Wall Street veterans. In fact, mani even ridicul the Oracl of Omaha for miss out name like Apple,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Until Appl came along,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) wa Buffett' largest tech play. He use to say he skip over tech stock becaus he didn't understand them well enough.But it appear that Buffett' understand of technolog is growing.I n 2016,Berkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) report a 9.8 million-shar posit in AAPL stock as of March 31. That posit almost doubl to 15.2 million share as of Sept. 30, then almost quadrupl to a whop 57.3 million share by year' end.So what ha Buffett done with AAPL stock in 2017?7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackTh Oracl of Omahaha more than doubl hi position. The stake now stand at some 133 million share worth about $18.1 billion. Buffett buy some 75 million share of AAPL stock in such a short span show confid in Apple.Whil Buffett is not known for hi short-term predictions, he is herald for hi long-term investments. So, what doe he like so much about Appl stock anyway? ""Appl strike me as have quit a sticki product, and an enorm use product to peopl that use it,"" Buffett told CNBC in late-February.Perhap the most iron part of Buffett' discuss on Appl center on hi own devic - the fame investor doesn't even own an iPhone.Posit for AAPL StockAppl stock ha a lot of positives. For starters, the compani is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Appl could go on a transform M&A spree - even with the repatri tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potenti for a tax repatri holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple' in even better shape.Additionally, Appl is a cash cow that continu to bring in billion of dollar each quarter, which should help continu to fund dividend and stock buybacks. Plus, it cash hoard should continu to grow over time.Despit ralli more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trade with a below-market valuation. Sport a price-to-earn ratio of around 16, it' hard to consid Appl overvalued.And the valuat argument is important. Too mani investor tri to justifi a higher Appl stock price by appli a market-averag multiple. That' an inaccur measurement, as Appl tend to trade between a P/E rang of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rare will it trade in-lin with the averageS&P 500stock.With that said, have a low valuat is part of what make Appl stock attractive. Share go through pretti extrem up and downs. But long-term investor can feel confid in buy a stock that' not egregi priced.Finally, investor can look forward to Appl releas themuch-anticip iPhon 8later thi fall. With a higher potenti sell price and plenti of fanci features, the new devic is like to drive record results.Add on it quickli growing, high-margin Servic business, and AAPL stock becom even more attract for long-term investors.Should You Follow Buffett Into AAPL Stock?With all these positives, Appl stock may seem like a slam-dunk.However, I think investor would be best off wait for a pullback. While we just highlight it P/E ratio as a positive, itisclos to the top of it five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compar to the averag stock, but get expens compar to it histor average.Additionally, Appl stock ha gone on a massiv rally. While it' admittedli consolid nice just under $140, I find it hard to be a buyer at these levels.Whi Gener Electr Compani (GE) Stock Is Way Too DangerousWith the overal market still up big, I can sleep more comfort at night wait for a pullback to buy Appl stock. If it doesn't materialize, that is someth wait investor will have to live with. I would rather miss a few point of upsid in order to avoid signific point on the downside.Historically, Apple' stock is volatile, whichmak a pullback likelyat some point in the next few months.A 7% to 10% correct would be need for me to get interested.Bret Kenwel is the manag and author ofFutur Blue Chips.

Organ are control by pattern of electr impuls transmit through nerv fibers, but when organ dysfunct in chronic disease, the electr pattern are different. That fact open up the possibl that insert pattern in nerv to certain organ can correct condit that lead to disease. Use electr impuls to influenc organ function is noth new -- cardiac pacemak have been in use for decad -- but scientist are just begin to realiz the possibl of use nerv signal to restor organ to normal function and actual treat disease.Imag source: GlaxoSmithKlin plc.makeArticleAd();A semin paper wa publish in the scientif journal Natur in 2000 which present evid that stimul of the vagu nerv could actual trigger an anti-inflammatori respons in rats.

Sinc then, research have come to believ that influenc the the body' electr system could lead to treatment for condit as divers as asthma, arthritis, inflammatori bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, infertility, and even cancer.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Carries Some Risks,3/14/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI recent wrote anarticlesuggest thatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) wa the perfect valu play, as it wa a growth stock that wa not unreason valu base on variou criteria. Now I'll dive into what I think the risk of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMi biggest concern with GOOGL stock ha alway been that it is effect a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digit advertis billboard in the world, with about 88% of it revenu come from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock' growth ha been driven by thi spectacular seizur of internet territori from competitors.In fact, dure the financi crisis, ad revenu still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despit a worldwid ad revenuedeclineof 11% that year.GOOGL Stock and Digit AdvertisingNow, digit advertis wa still in it hyper-growth phase back then. Should anoth major crisi hit, I'm not so sure that Alphabet won't see a decline. Yet what' so astonish about GOOGL stock is just how much money it make from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% declin in total revenues, which would bring it roughli in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still gener net incom of $15 billion or so, and oper cash flow of $26 billion or so.Thi is hardli a catastrophe, which show that for now at least, GOOGL ha a lock on substanti growth in ad revenue. However, that advertis is the result of peopl use Google' search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Googl ha more than 80% search engin marketshare. It' so popular that we now use the product' name as a verb.7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You BackI think it will be veri difficult to supplant Googl as far as search engin usag goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less relianc on the search engin and, therefore, fewer eyebal for ads. Mobil app have obvious explod in number and usage. The more adept and fulli function that app become, the less Googl may be used.Soci media is onli go to grow, and the more that these product offer in term of either their own search engines, or place for advertis to divid their ad spend, the wors it is for GOOGL.There' also some interest competit in the form of product searches, and of course, that competit come fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Accord to a 2016 PowerReviewssurvey, 38% of user use Amazon as a place to search for products, and Googl come in second at 35%. I think about my own usag when it come to product searched, and yes, I alway start with Amazon. Inventory, price and review are the reason whi peopl start there. The larger that Amazon grows, the stickier it will becom as far as product searches, and that could mean fewer eyebal for GOOGL.Obviously, Alphabet Inc. ha plenti of money and can ramp up competit in mobil access, butAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) obvious have a corner on that market so far.What Nvidia Need to Avoid a Breakdown (NVDA)Ther is some regulatori risk, as well. The EU slam Alphabet Inc. for tweak search result to direct peopl to it own shop sites. The FCC is an unknown beast - it could end up regul the internet in way harm to GOOGL stock.However, when it come to buy the stock, I don't see immedi danger to GOOGL that make it valuat less attractive. At 18x next year' earnings, and five-year annual analyst project of 19.3% growth, it' alreadi undervalued. When I give it a 10% premium for global brand name, cash flow and cash on hand, it becom a true growth and valu play.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own,3/14/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBi most accounts, the futur look bright forAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Citi recent up it price target on Appl stock in anticip of a massiv wave of upgrad from iPhon owner who have age models, and the company' plan to doubl it high-margin servic revenu over the cours of the come four year doesn't seem un-doable.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAft all, AAPL ha been beef up it app and digit content busi at a rather brisk pace for some time now.And yet, to observ not look at the compani through rose-color glasses, there' potenti troubl ahead. Here' a closer look at three headwind that could slow AAPL share down more than most trader might expect.Thre Troubl Realiti for Appl StockLast week, analyst with Citi rais their price target on Appl stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintain the research outfit' ""Buy"" rating), think a wide swath of the 715 million iPhon owner out there right now are on the verg of final upgrad their device, as31% of those owner haven't upgrad in a coupl of years.It' not bad logic; we know the company' best new custom are it old ones.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowMeanwhile, though it wa littl more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook ha put plenti of emphasi on sale of servic and digit content. He' onli scratch the surface, however. After gener roughli $25 billion in revenu in 2016, Appl is aim for $50 billion in servic revenu by $50 billion. That' still onli a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenu Appl muster in 2016, but digit sale now make up the company' second-biggest segment; the iPhon is still the biggest.Befor we pop the cork on the champagn bottl though, there are three red flag everyon would be wise to process.1. The iPhon 8 (probably) cost too muchWhil the launch of the iPhon 7 in the fall of last year could be consid a success in that the compani sold arecord-break 78.2 million unit in the previou quarter, given thehyp surround the device, the compani should have blown away sale figur for it iPhon 6.Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materi for the 7 wa ultim displac to the iPhon 8, which is suppos to be unveil in Septemb of thi year. The word is that the admittedli impress devic is go togo for a cool $1000 each. At that price, even the most loyal of Appl fan could balk.2. The popular smartphon is preemptiv cannib itselfAsid from sticker shock, would-b owner of the upcom iPhon 8 may keep their wallet close for the same reason mani potenti buyer of the iPhon 7 didn't pull the trigger - they'r wait for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.To that end, what' current be refer to as the iPhon 9 alreadi promis (in rumors) to be an amaz piec of hardware,complet with a fold screen. That may postpon purchas of the iPhon 8 later thi year, though 2018' iPhon 9 could see softer demand becaus whisper of the iPhon 10 rumor will be circul by then.It' a viciou cycle, with Appl arguabl unabl to ever realli log a blowout iPhon launch.Fitbit Ha BlackBerri Syndrom (FIT)3. The Googl Pixel is really, realli impressiveFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiari Googl was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analyst estim the companyonli sold about 2.5 million of the device.Bear in mind, however, thi is Google' first direct foray into the smartphon world, and could be consid littl more than a dri run.Th Pixel 2 is slate to debut sometim thi year, and it' a good bet the compani ha made a point of learn a lot with it first outing.Bottom Line for AAPL StockInvariably, some (or several) owner of Appl stock interpret these concern as a call that the compani is doomed, and then proceed to ""color disagree."" So, let me clarifi someth that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock' worst day it' still essenti unstopp to other smartphon players. Don't read too much into the worries.On the flipside, in that Appl stock is all too often found on investors' pedest - lift there by assumpt that the compani is infal - it' never a bad idea to recogn all plausibl risks. These three risk could each end up stir up surpris headwinds, and noth take a toll on a stock like an unexpect disappointment.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stock Hold You Back7 Futur Blue-Chip Stock You Need to BuyTh post3 Reason Appl Inc.

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First,3/13/2017,"There' no shortag of technolog compani and automot maker that are are bet that autonom vehicl will transform both of their industries. But how do you figur out which compani are pois to benefit the most?To answer that, investor first need to know what the market potenti is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then determin which driverless car invest angl they want to take. Here are a few step to help you get started:Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be worthBi 2025, the driverless car market is expect to be worth $42 billion, accord to Boston Consult Group. The market size jump up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestim that there will be 76 million autonom vehicl alreadi on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless car are expect to transform ride share services, allow car owner to rent out their own vehicl -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk ha suggest -- and even help tradit carmak creat their own ride hail services, likeFord(NYSE: F) ha proposed.Thi might slow driverless car stock downIt' not go to be all sunshin and lollipop for driverless car stock though. There are still mani hurdl face these companies, includ feder regulations, safeti concerns, and consum adopt issues.Th two biggest automot markets, howev -- the U.S. and China -- have thu far been veri open to driverless cars. Back in September, the feder govern releas guidelin for state to help ensur that compani are abl to innov and not be hamper by differ rule across state lines. But the problem is that we'r still in the veri earli stage of driverless car technolog (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fulli autonom vehicles), so while the govern is open to it now, that could chang when more tech start be use by the gener population.And even if the govern doesn't end up stifl autonom vehicles, there' current a grow movement toban driverless car in New Yorkbecaus peopl are afraid they'll elimin job for taxi drivers, bu driver and other in the transport sector. Add to that the fact that there are part of the popul thatfeel veri uneasyabout driverless car and it' clear that the autonom vehicl market still ha a long way to go.Ther are plenti of way to investCompani like Tesla are among the obviou choic for bet on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk ha said he want to have a fulli autonom car capabl of drive itself across the countri by 2018, and everi new Tesla built right now alreadi ha the hardwar capabl for full autonomi (though not all of the softwar is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is anoth clear choice. Google' parent compani recent spun out it driverless car segment into it own company,cal Waymo, and is work to bring fulli autonom minivan to the road thi year for public testing, along with a ride-shar service.And then there are chipmak likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is invest heavili in artifici intellig and it own supercomput to power driverless cars. The company'sDr PX 2 supercomputeri alreadi use by 80 automak and automot supplier (includ Tesla) and is like to expand it automot revenu substanti in the come years.Of course, you could go the tradit rout too and bet on automak like Ford, which is also focus it attent on self-driv technologies. The compani recent invest $1 billion in a self-driv car start-up, call Argo AI, and say that it will releas it own fulli autonom vehicl (with no steer wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be take a slower approach than some other self-driv tech makers, but it ha plan to have 90 self-driv test vehicl on the road thi year and is work with more than 40 start-up on driverless car technology.And if you'r look for a driverless car stock outsid of the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) isprob your best bet. The compani ha been develop self-driv technolog for year and just launch a test program in some Chines citi to implement it tech. The compani want to releas a fulli self-driv car by next year with the hope of have a ride-hail servic in the come years. Asid from it aggress driverless car approach, Baidu benefit from China' open to self-driv technolog and fewer regul for road test than the U.S.Here' how long you might need to wait for thi to play outAlright, so now we know how big thi market will be, some of the potenti hurdles, and who the key player are. So how long will investor have to wait for thi opportun to pan out? IH estim that we'll reach worldwid driverless car ubiqu by about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car stock to benefit of course, but it doe mean that we still have a long way to go befor the market will matur -- which make now the perfect time for investor to start consid driverless car stocks.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Most recently,AT&T(NYSE: T) launch DirecTV Now, give consum three distinct choic (not count the not-yet-launch option from YouTub and Hulu which are still developing).For consum it' a lot of choices, but unlik tradit cabl where everi compani offer roughli the same package, these three player are somewhat different. That make determin the best one a bit of a move target, but with three player in the space (and two more coming) it' clearli a buyer' market.makeArticleAd();DISH Sling ha the cheapest offer. Imag source: DISH.DISH ha the lowest base priceFor consum look to cut the cord in order to save money (or those who never had a cord, but are look for the cheapest way to have some live-stream channels) DISH'sSl TVmay be the answer. The servic offer 30 channel includ ESPN, CNN, TNT, and a number of other cabl favorit for $20 a month as part of it ""Orange"" package. For $25 a month consum could opt for ""Blue"" which drop ESPN but add the FOX famili of channel includ the broadcast network while offer 44 total choices.On top of the base packag Sling Subscrib can choos from a number of extra add-on in area like news, sports, and kid program which cost $5 or $10 each. Sling member can also add HBO, Cinemax, Starz, or one of a varieti of global program option which conveni all work within the same player make for a veri television-lik experience.PlaySt Vue is cord-fre cableSony' PlayStat Vue ha four packag start at $29.99 a month. The entry-level offer, ""Access Slim"" come with 45 channels, includ in very-limit market some broadcast networks. Most of the station offer are the same one Sling TV has, with consum pay slightli more money for them. The ""Core Slim"" packag offer 60 channel for $34.99 (perhap the best deal) while ""Elit Slim"" come with 90 channel for $44.99, and Ultra Slim at $64.99 which ha the same 90 channel plu HBO and Showtime.Lik Sling, PlayStat Vue also offer add-on packag of Spanish-languag and news programs. In addit user can buy a number of premium channel on a stand-alon basi along with HBO and Showtime. The bottom tier for PS Vue are veri similar to DISH, albeit pricier, while the higher-end tier are essenti full-on cabl packag (minu the broadcast network in most cases) at better-than-c pricing.Here' what DirecTV is doingAT&T' entre into the space look a lot like Sony's. DirecTV Now offer veri similar price with 60 channel cost $35, includ ABC and FOX, along with some top-tier cabl favorites. $50 a month get user 80-plu channels, while $60 a month come with over 100, and $70 take the packag to over 120 station includ Starz.Subscrib can also add Starz separ to lower-ti deals, or add HBO or Cinemax. AT&T doe not offer add-on channel packag cover specialti station the way it rival do. In addit DirecTV Now launch with better price (the $35 price for the $50 package) and it seem like that AT&T will offer futur special like tie to bundl other servic from the company.Which one is the best?For consum it' easi to test each servic becaus all offer free trials, while also let user come and go as they pleas without contract or penalties. Sling ha the best servic for peopl look to cut expens while Soni and AT&T offer good deal on servic that come close to mirror actual cable. Of those two, DirecTV Now get a slight edg becaus it offer ABC and FOX nation while PlayStat Vue onli offer access to broadcast network selectively.In addit to vari channel selections, all three servic have differ rule when it come to multipl streams. Sling Orange, the cheapest service, onli offer a singl stream, while the $25 Blue packag allow three. DirectTV Now offer two stream to all subscrib while Sony' servic allow custom to stream on five regist devic at a time give PS Vue the advantag in thi area, but it' a minor edg over Blue.When it come to interfac all three leav someth to be desired. Sony' servic ha a DVR (with a lot of limitations) while Sling ha some on-demand programming, as doe DirecTV. The biggest drawback of the stream servic is that none of them offer an experi that feel like flip around with tradit cable. Still, onc you have select a show, the view experi work and feel familiar.Soni and AT&T have decent product that save consum some money over the averag compar cabl package. But for a tradit famili watch on multipl televisions, the save may not be worth the hole in what' offer along with a view experi that still lag tradit cable. Sling ha those same limitations, but the three stream for $25 Blue packag repres the best combo of content and value, give it a small victori in an emerg space.10 stock we like better than DISH NetworkWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL),3/13/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world' largest technolog company, and it onc wa one of the best growth stock on the market. It ha shift gears, though, and now Appl stock is one of the more promis dividend growth play on the market.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrAAPL paid it first dividend - at least sinc 1995 - on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investor 38.9 cent per share on a split-adjust basis.Th payout ha been hike four time since, and current sit at 57 cent per share. That' a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017' dividend increas expect to be similar. After all, AAPL stock onli ha a payout ratio of 27% of it trail earn and a 1.6% yield.When you look at sharehold yield - dividend plu buyback - Apple' record is even more impressive. The compani spent $12.2 billion on dividend and a whop $29.2 billion on share repurchas in 2016. That work out to a sharehold yield of 5.6%.AAPL is return capit at a blister pace.10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the BillsHowever, while most sharehold are ecstat with the dividend on Appl stock, allow me to present an altern argument:Appl should cut it payout … and mayb even elimin it altogether.Apple, Meet AlphabetLet' take a minut to compar Appl to one of it peers,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Alphabet' dividend polici is pretti clear. It saidin it 2016 10-K filing, ""We have never declar or paid ani cash dividend on our common or capit stock. We intend to retain ani futur earn and do not expect to pay ani cash dividend in the forese future.""Alphabet can easili afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.Th reason behind thi is simple. Alphabet is aggress invest in the kind of project that can realli boost it top line. It ha been work on a self-driv car sinc 2009. It invest more than$6 billion on Googl Fiber. Alphabet also team up withFidelitytoinvest $1 billion inSpaceX.In total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and develop in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capit expenditures.Appl is still invest in the future, but not as aggress as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and develop and $13.5 billion on capit expenditur in 2016, despit make a net profit of $45.7 billion.In other words, Alphabet reinvest $24.1 billion back into it busi in 2016 while earn $19.5 billion. Appl reinvest $23.5 billion while earn $45.7 billion. AAPL bare reinvest half of it earn back into it business.AAPL Need to Make Some AcquisitionsAppl doe have some excit plans. One of the tech world' worst-kept secret is Apple' plan to somehow be a part of thecar of the future. It ha also been work in thevirtu realiti space, and mani expect big improv toAppl TV. These invest are great. But I don't think they'll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.It' time for Appl to go shopping.Appl could easili take the $41 billion it gave back to sharehold in 2016 and use it to make a huge splash.Say Appl agre to buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) at a 50% premium to today' price - so, roughli $91 billion. AAPL could pay off the deal in just a few year from it exist cash flow alone, and would own a compani that ha doubl revenu in the last three years.Intel Corpor (INTC) Buy Mobiley NV (MBLY) to Win the Auto MarketApple' main growth driver today is servic revenue. In it most recent quarter, AAPL grew it top line 3% on a quarter-over-quart basis.It grew servic revenu by 18%. Acquir Netflix would would not onli supercharg that division, it would give Appl access to Netflix' whole librari of content.Th Bottom Line on Appl StockThere' a reason whi AAPL trade at the same multipl as the rest of the market. Investor assum - right so - that it is a matur compani with no immedi growth prospects. If Appl slash it dividend and announc it wa use that money for acquisitions, investor would sit up and take notice.There' no guarante such sentiment would send Appl stock soar right away. In fact, it'd be easi to see the market take the short-term view that someth is amiss, and sell AAPL as a result.But if execut right, such a strategi would make Appl sharehold richer in the long run.A of thi writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

The same research believ total revenu relat to eSport will reach $1.1 billion by 2019, up from $463 million in 2016. The rush of money and interest into the sport should help continu to creat demand for NVIDIA' best-of-bre graphic process chips, which rose 44% last year.Bett still, major trend like AI softwar and driverless car remain in their earli stages. Last year, NVIDIA saw an unpreced surg in demand for it GPU to power an impress host of applications.

In Part I, I discuss whi it' now increasingli clear that the human voic will becom society' next major comput interface, and whi it will continu prolifer through our home and businesses. In Part II, I'll dive deeper into the new and emerg busi models. In Part II, I'll discuss the variou player involv in the race to commerci the technolog -- those best-posit to profit today, those posit themselv to thrive tomorrow, and those drop the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper into the fascin busi model voic comput will soon enable, and how those model will evolv as the technolog continu to improve.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();For nearli 40 years, we'v seen the comput evolv into an indispens accessori of Western societi driven by three power technolog that defin their era and play a monument role for investor along the way.Th person comput gave mani of us our first glimps at the digit world, normal the idea that such machin have a place in our home and everyday lives. The internet tap us into that world, offer us endless flood of information, entertainment, and commerc around which we willingli began shape our civilization. And then the smartphon encourag us to take that digit world everywher we go, leav noth but a few tap on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and constant immersion.Now, a fourth technolog -- voic computing--i remov that last barrier.Reimagin the role comput playImagin drive down the highway, come home from work, and without take your hand off the wheel or hit ani buttons, ask your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the oven for dinner, and play your favorit album, all in the same breath. Pictur negoti with a street vendor in Beijing, have your phone translat the entir convers between Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggl in real time. Or how about a stuf anim that can tell your daughter interact stori everi night befor bed, reshap the adventur at everi twist and turn base on her respons and reactions.Thes aren't hypothet scenario -- they'r happen right now.Th human voic is well on it way to becom the next major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll explor in thi two-part series,voicecomputingi the burgeon field of technolog make it possible. Alreadi span multipl consum and enterpris ventur (think call center routing, digit dictation, or the virtual assist on smartphones), the industry' ultim aim is enabl peopl to carri on hands-free, conversational-styl interact with computers.It' an ambiti prospect capabl of significantli expand the role comput play in our everyday lives, but it' also one that appear inevit when consid the trajectori comput have taken, without fail, sinc their introduction, evolv in shape and form around contemporari technolog to solv unmet needs.Imag Source: Getti ImagesAnd yet voic computing' evolut is different. Unlik ani form of comput to come befor it, the technolog bypass the physic realm, allow user to queri the internet, manag their surroundings, and connect to third-parti servic without ever have to touch a physic devic -- all in the time it take to form a sentence.If that sound unnecessary, then consid just how limitless the applic could be. From the surgeon who need to rapidli adjust the condit of her oper room mid-procedure, to the disabl veteran who simpli hope to access the applianc in hi home. The sheer number of everyday applic for such a technolog ha prompt Grand View Research to project the global market for voic recognit technolog will reach $128 billion annual by 2024, an estim that may undershoot the overal econom opportun at play consid the potenti vertic includ healthcare, defense, entertainment, consum goods, and more (I'll discuss these in more detail in Part II).Ther is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voic comput is extrem like to transform the way we interact with technolog in society, but befor that can happen, a large-scal societ shift toward adopt the interfac must occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until sever key hurdl are overcome.Understand the challeng aheadTo analyz those obstacles, let' turn to the most promis applic of voice-driven technolog today: virtual digit assistants.Data Sources: Socrat Technologies, Vantiv, Statista. Chart by AuthorThank to the success of the iPhon andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is current the most wildli use virtual assist in the Unit States, but until recently, it' also perfectli exemplifi what' hold voic comput back. To put it simply, speak with Siri can often feel more like a novelti than a time-saver, a sentiment share not just among Appl users, but most smartphon owner with access to similar voic comput technology.It' a problem we can break down into three fundament hurdles.Th first is that user must often resort to awkward combin of hyper-specif phrase and hurri robo-speak to have their speech accur recognized. Andrew Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respect name in the field, perhap put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech recognition, depend on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So mayb it get one word in 20 wrong. That' realli annoy if it get one in 20 wrong and you probabl don't want to use it veri often. That' probabl where speech recognit is today.""Th second hurdl is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remain a strong chanc it will bemisinterpretedwhil undergo natur languag understanding, a process in which the assist attempt to comprehend what we want use the sequenc of word (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctli understood, an assist may still simpli be unabl to solv for the request due to technic constraints. Exampl of both case can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sens of how frustrat the encount can be.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneEncount like these make us feel as though we'r wast our time trust our phone to do what we could have done ourselv with onli a littl more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventu discourag us from even tryingto use our assist for anyth complex, instead reli on them onli for the most trivial of tasks, like set alarm or creat reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdl are solvabl with data, third-parti partnerships, and time, each of which the major player in thi space have been activ accru for years. Return to our example, sinc Siri wa introduc to the world in 2011, virtual assist have grown far more capabl of correctli interpret request thank to advanc in deep learning, a thrive field of AI be util byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and other to improv speech recognition, natur languag understanding, and other compon of voic comput at astound rates. (Click herefor an outstand stori byTh New York Timeson Google' signific role in make thi happen).Equ as important, decis by Appl and it competitor to open their platform up to third-parti servic have made today' voice-bas assist feel far more capabl than in year past. These decis allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride use your Uber account, or order a pizza through your storedDomino'sinform -- not unlik anactualsecretari would do.A the potenti behind voic comput becom increasingli obviou in the come month and years, we should expect more and more third parti to hop on board, eventu expand the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of order an Uber, imagin order a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-parti command avail on Amazon' voice-bas assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technic achiev and partnership will continu compounding, eventu make for a highli practic voic comput experience. Even margin improv in the technolog will convinc user to begin use voic as an interfac more frequently. In the same talk regard the current state of the voic industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as speech recognit accuraci goe from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from bare use it today, to use it all the time."" He added, ""Most peopl underestim the differ between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer.""Although we'r not yet abl to predict when the technolog will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is ani indic -- sinc Ng' speech, Baidu ha built a program capabl of dictat English three time faster, and with 20% less errors, than human be -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguabl far more import hurdl stand in the way. It' a problem share by everi other major comput medium in use today, onli voic is actual solv for it.An instantan comput experienceNo matter the medium, we'v alway interact with comput by issu commands. In the 1950s, we meticul punch those command into card befor feed them into hulk machines. Now, technolog allow us to simpli type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despit these advancements, today' medium still subject user to a uniqu set of delays, a sort of friction that inher slow down the process betweenthinkinga command and actual be abl tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decad ago, that friction most like entail track down a PC with internet, use the mous to open a browser, use the keyboard to run a search, and then sort for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simpli mean reach into our pocket for our phone, scroll with our thumb, and tap away.It' a process so effortless, the averag American now check their phone an estim 46 time per day. It' even becom fashion to argu there' no longerenoughfrict separ societi from our devices; that we'retooplug in to the digit world.So when you consid that voic computing' primari advantag iseliminatingfriction, it becom tempt to dismiss the technolog as a solut to a trivial problem. What that argument critic fail to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simpl convenience, and that ani amount of friction, no matter how small, fundament limit the dynam between a user and their comput medium in two ways.Let' take the smartphon for example.Imag Source: PixabayTh seemingli trivial motion we make when reach for our phone still requir us to be in immedi proxim of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to rememb it' on the counter even befor we can do that. Then, onc we'v reach our phone, we'r requir to physic handl it, a process that gener requir we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limit forc our comput experi to revolv around the locat of our device, as oppos to it revolv around us.They can creat roadblock for those with disabl affect their vision or hand (or really, even those who just have sticki hands, wet hands, or their hand full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immedi comput need.There' a reason speech is our most instinctu form of communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouth and ask. We do that becaus it' instantaneous. Now contrast that with have to locat your phone, have to type in your password, have to navig to an app, have to tap, type, or speak your command. These behavior are not instinctual,but we put up with them becaus the peopl around us usual don't have the answers, and becaus smartphon are our best alternative.But they don't have to be.Th rise of voiceIt' not obviou quit yet, but today' physic bound medium have left a larg hole to fill and voic comput is start to fill it.Ov the past two years, the technolog ha begun manifest itself in the form of always-on, always-listen devic abl to virtual bypass the friction inher in today' major comput mediums. Currently, these devic are best exemplifi by Amazon' line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voic recognit technolog allow user to command Alexa from across multipl room and through variou background nois at ani time simpli by call for it out loud.Imag Source: Amazon.com.Put anoth way, for as littl as $50, Amazon' Echo is give consum their first glimps at a frictionless comput experience. Follow it initi setup, there' no press buttons, no look around for the device, and no navig through screen to issu a command. When it work correctli (like Siri, Alexa is still veri much in it infanc and subject to misinterpret commands) it realli doe allow user to convert their thought to a command in the time it take to form a sentence, captur the essenti promis of voic as a medium.And if the earli estim adopt rate for the devic is ani indic -- Amazon hasn't offici releas sale figures, but as of Januari 2016, Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP) estim a stagger 8.2 million Echo have alreadi been sold in the U.S. (a number that pale in comparison to Morgan Stanley' estim of over 11 million), suggest the devic ha achiev well over 5% household penetr -- earli demand for a seamless comput experi is strong, and will like grow stronger as capabl competitor race to introduc their own offer (see Google' Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu' Littl Fish), and as voic recognition, natur languag understanding, and third-parti support continu improv at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figur are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devic will never replac today' exist comput mediums, but will rather augment them. While screen will remain the prefer medium for our more detail and visual comput needs, voic will begin it ascent by take on an increas share of our more ""conversational"" demands, common request we want address with the immediaci we expect from dialogu (""Cancel my doctor' appointment."" ""Paus that music!"" ""What' a good non-fict book to read on the beach? ... Great, order that one."")A the technolog grow capabl of handl increasingli nuanc and complex requests, and as voice-en devic prolifer and evolve, we can expect more user to grow comfort engag with the technolog around the home, in the workplace, and gradual more pervas aspect of society.Andthat'swher the real opportun begin.Th opportun at handSom of the biggest tech empir in modern histori have been built around the person computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which ha provid the infrastructur for technolog to penetr deeper and more reflex into everyday life, allow creativ compani to reach consum in entir new ways.In just 10 years, the iPhon help Appl grow to becom the largest corpor in the world, but it also popular smartphon technolog in the U.S., help to creat the infrastructur that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless other to creat busi that reach deeper into our live than ani before.Imag Source: Author' iPhoneAnd yet voic technolog is go deeper.It' becom an invisible, always-listen medium that surround us, weav itself more seamlessli into the fabric of our live than ani befor it.

Consum UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless car becom affordable, no one will buy them if they don't understand them.

There will certainli be more tragedi in the futur of autonom vehicles, and it will remain a continu challeng and the highest prioriti for self-driv car compani to minim safeti and secur issues. However, it' also import to rememb that these high-profil case can caus over-reactions, and stick to statist can help investors, companies, and consum alik identifi the best autonom option for investing, manufacturing, and purchasing.4 & 5: Regul and TechnologyA with all new innovations, regul and technolog can make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note that regul is a hurdle, rather than a never-end issue. It make sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Car have all join togeth to creat the ""Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Streets."" Rather than ralli for ""wild west"" free market competition, these compani want to see a sensibl framework of standard regul upon which they can confid build their new busi units.Technolog isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold below which driverless car will never be the norm. Compani like Alphabet' Waymo and Tesla Motor are aim for full autonomy, while other are take the more step-wis approach of offer semi-autonom addit like Audi' ""Traffic Jam Assist."" The McKinsey report estim that, onc regul and technolog issu have been resolved, ""up to 15 percent of new car sold in 2030 could be fulli autonomous.""Hit the brakes?Imag Source: Getti Images.2017 will not be the year self-driv car take over our roads. Pricing, consum understanding, safety/security, regulation, and technolog issu will continu to imped thi industry' revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and other are make steadi gain on address these issues, and the ultim widespread adopt of autonom technolog is almost inarguable. Forward-look investor with long-term horizon should acknowledg these issues, select their self-driv stock accordingly, and sit back to enjoy thi multi-year market road trip.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Snap Inc Wants From Drones,3/10/2017,"Recent public social media companySnap(NYSE: SNAP) ha been make a few head-scratch decis with their market strategi lately, not the least of which is it grow interest in drone technology. While it make sens for compani likeAppleandGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) to pour money into moonshot technolog projects, it' a bit more of a confus move for Snap to make.In thi clip fromIndustri Focus: Tech, tech sector bureau chief Dylan Lewi and contributor Evan Niu talk about what Snap might possibl want from their invest in drones, a few reason whi put so much money and time into drone is probabl ill-advised, and more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follow the video.10 stock we like better than GoProWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and GoPro wasn't one of them! That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on March 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Th next piec of news we'r go to talk about is even more bizarre. Accord to report fromTh New York Times, the compani had other hardwar ambitions, name drones. At the moment, detail are scarce, but sever anonym sourc at the compani confirm Snap ha been pursu a drone camera project. I guess the thought here is, drone would allow aerial Snaps, it would allow peopl to captur video and imag in a more novel way and a cool landscap way. Again, thi seem kind of crazi to me, for thi to be the focus.Evan Niu:[laughs] Yeah. It make no sens to me. As ridicul as the Spectacl thing is, tri to brand a compani around those, the drone thing also make no sens to me. It' hard to imagin someon buy a drone. First of all, it' hard to imagin Snap come out with a drone that is competit with what' alreadi out there from DJI and evenGoPro. Look at even GoPro tri to get into drone -- they'v had a lot of trouble. A compani like GoPro that had experi make camera still ha troubl make a realli compel drone that ha all the full featur that peopl expect nowadays.Lewis:They famous had to recal one of their products, becaus they were have troubl with it.Niu:Yeah, becaus the batteri wa loose. If you shook it, the batteri would move by a millimet and the contact would lose power, which is a realli simpl and kind of embarrass problem. It wa such a silli littl mistake, and it probabl had someth to do with their manufactur or something, I don't know. But yeah, the point being, GoPro hasn't realli pull off the drone thing veri well either. And they were probabl much better-posit to make that kind of jump in the first place. And, of course, thi is just a report that they'r work on. Who know if they actual do it. I hope they realiz that it' a bad idea, and probabl save everyon a bunch of headach if they just don't do it at all. I mean, I guess it' not surpris that they have look into it, sinc they want to becom a camera company. But whether or not they actual do it, I think the chanc are probabl against it. I would hope so.Lewis:Yeah. I get that, it' tempt to be a tech compani and have these realli sexi side project. You see the stuff that Alphabet ha done with Google' self-driv cars. That is so far afield from their core search property. Even get into virtual realiti on the hardwar side with Oculus. But, you look at those two companies, those are busi that have a cash cow underli all of these futurist R&D projects. Their core platforms, their ad-sel platform are do wonder for them, and are allow them to throw money off on the side, and see what happen with these more futuristic, hard-to-pin-down-what-the-impact-might-b type projects. I think with Snap right now, there' a littl bit of a focu concern on my end, becaus you haven't realli figur out your core platform yet, you haven't monet it realli well. You'r still roll ad into it and build it into the user experience. And, you have like 3% quarter-to-quart user growth. You have so mani issu with what should be your core focus, I'm not realli sure whi they'r doubl down on their hardwar initiatives, if thi is someth they'r realli spend a lot of time on.Niu:That' a good point, I agre completely. Whi aren't they focus on get the core busi up and run in a good way? They'r just now realli roll out these ads. Of course, in advertising, your abil to target ad is realli critic in deliv valu to your advertisers, who are the actual customers. That' who pay you.Facebookdo a realli good job with ad target becaus they have so much of your data.Twitter, I think, ha had some troubles, which is partial whi they'r not monet as well as they should be. So, I guess the question is, how much user data can Snap realli get, and how valuabl will that be? Most of the stuff you'r put on Snapchat disappear immediately. What kind of data can they gather that' go to be realli use to turn around and use for targeting? It' kind of the same thing with Twitter. A lot of times, peopl can view tweet publicli without have to sign in, which limit Twitter' abil to gather data on them, which is also whi it' harder for them to monet their users. It' a big question on execut go forward, how they can realli grow thi ad business. If they can, thi will do well. They are veri new to this.Lewis:Yeah, it' someth that I think they realli have to figur out still. You look at the data point that Facebook and Googl have on their users, and you'r right, it' total different, the profil is so robust for what peopl have on their Facebook. They know all my interests, they know everyth I like, and they'r abl to incorpor that into the algorithm they'r use to feed stuff up to me. Googl know exactli what you'r search for, and can serv up hyper-relev stuff. With Snap, they know your friends, they know your demographic, and mayb they know some of the outlet that you'r typic interest in on the stori side. But I think they still need to do a ton to figur that out, and I'd rather see them doubl down there than go further afield with some of these hardwar projects.Niu:Yeah. The big emphasi on hardwar in gener is confound to me. I don't understand whi they'r do it, or whi they'r tri to make thi pivot -- if you want to call it a pivot. They should just get down to work on their actual ad platform, focu on the software-as-a-servic stuff, befor they realli start dabbl in thi hardwar stuff. Hardwar is hard.Lewis:And the way that their hardwar is set up, too, their Spectacl are built-in to integr with Snapchat. They'r not realli a devic that you can use across platforms.Niu:Well, you can export, and it export in a circular format as oppos to the squar format that most peopl see. So, there is a way that you can export content that you take on Spectacles. But, yeah, the point is, you would think they would want to tie exclus to the platform. But then, it' like, whi would you buy some product that' onli avail for thi platform? Conversely, if it' not a good product, if it work on all platforms, whi would you buy it unless it' the best product out there? It' thi realli weird Catch 22. Imagine, would you buy a product that could onli submit stuff to Facebook? It doesn't make ani sense. But that would be the differenti factor. But yeah, their whole strategi make no sens to me.Lewis:Yeah, it seem a littl backwards. The point that I wa go to make is just, the biggest salesman for the hardwar stuff is go to be peopl be on the platform in general. The address market for those product is go to be whatev the user base that they have is. Right now, it' around 160 million daili activ users. The most compel way to make that hardwar busi look appet is to continu to grow that user base, then mayb you have peopl that want someth that' a littl bit more dedicated. I'm still skeptic of that. But ultimately, that logic tie back to, build the platform out and grow the user base, and worri about hardwar second, right?Niu:Yeah, I agree.Suzann Frey, an execut at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool' board of directors.Dylan Lewisown share of Alphabet (A shares), Apple, and Facebook.Evan Niu, CFAown share of Appl and Facebook.Evan Niu, CFAha the follow options: long Januari 2018 $120 call on Facebook.

AMD stock, after more than quintupl over the cours of the prior 12 months, fell 16% in just four day a week ago and ha struggl to pick itself up off the mat in the meantime.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledg via FlickrTh prod for the pullback? Report that it new (and well-hyped) comput processor wasn't perform quit as well as expect onc put to the test in real-world applications.A Ar Technica review Mark Walton put it:""Th [Ryzen] 1800X lag behind it Intel counterpart in gaming, regardless of whether it' run at the same clock speed or higher.""It wa a real blow to optimist investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hope that the new CPU would be the centerpiec of a turnaround story. Now that stori is in question.Th is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company' rebound as it' been made it to be. Indeed, Advanc Micro Devic ha a lot more go for it besid the new CPU that investor aren't give it credit for. Three specif item come to mind. Note than a hand of AMD' competitor are now becom partners.3 Thing AMD Still Ha Go For ItWhil investor had high expect for Ryzen, the futur for Advanc Micro Devic isn't depend on it. In fact, there are three other area that may end up mean even more for it top and bottom lines.9 Stock to Buy That Are Grow Faster Than AmazonIn no particular order …Penetr the Cloud Market:Whil AMD ha alway had a presenc in most key tech markets, cloud comput wa never a key one for the company. That' chang now though… a ball that got roll just in the past few weeks. In November,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl divis tap AMD,look to add it graphic processor unit to Google' machin learn architecture.It' a curiou development, as GPU chip weren't design to do anyth more than handl a computer' display screen. As it turn out, though, it GPU are veri capabl of parallel computing, which is a critic aspect of thi new cloud-bas function.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) select AMD processor to power it next-gener open cours cloud platform.At stake is a piec of the cloud infrastructur market worth an estim $300 billion per year.Mor Licens Revenue:It' onli an unconfirm rumor thu far, but a reason credibl one. That is,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedli interest in use AMD Radeon graphic technolog to power Intel' integr GPU in futur comput … displacingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel end at the end of March.At the veri least, the prospect of such an IP licens deal could mean a coupl hundr million dollar in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel realli want to step up it game, though, it could help fund improv in the way it CPU handl graphics.New GPU Will Enhanc New CPU Revenue:Whil the review for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holder should bear in mind that they'r onli half the next gener of hardwar for Advanc Micro Devices.Th other half of the one-two punch combin for AMD thi year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveil around the middl of thi year.A wa note back on Feb. 7:""Vega, is a second-gener high bandwidth memori (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memori architectur that perform significantli better than the more common GDDR5 (doubl data rate type-five) util by most graphic process unit today. An essentially-infinit amount of memori can be dedic to handl the display - the maximum virtual is cap at a ridicul 512 terabytes. Thi platform is about twice as power as most current alternatives, and will make Advanc Micro Devic competit with the newest gener of GPU architectur from Nvidia, call Pascal.""Mor important, Vega wa larg built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each get the most perform out of one another.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at Thi PriceIn the meantime, it' not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause.A the company' CEO Lisa Su recent explained, ""We hear peopl on want to see improv 1080p perform and we fulli expect that Ryzen perform in 1080p will onli get better as develop get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ develop now work with 'Zen' and sever of the develop for Ash of Singular and Total [War:] Warhamm are activ optim now.""Bottom Line for AMD StockA encourag as the futur may be for the compani whether or not Ryzen end up perform well, there' still no deni that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is noth compar to 2016' huge rally.But don't confus ani futur weak from AMD as evid of what' in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanc Micro Devic is veri well posit for a great 2017. The trick is just be patient enough to wait for a truli palat entri price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it' almost uncomfort to do so.

Snap' corpor structur is quit unusual, with the founder hold about 90% of the vote rights, and averag investor hold no vote at all.Exclud Snap share from the S&P 500 may not sound like a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underli fundament of the company. But the grow popular of index fund and ETF mean Snap will miss out on billion of dollar of buyer support that earli investor may have been expect down the road.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Spectacles.com.$6 trillion and growingIndex fund and ETF are expect to overtak activ manag invest in the next seven year or so, accord to Moody's. Currently, investor have plow $6 trillion in asset into the passiv investments. $2 trillion of those asset track the S&P 500 index.Get ad to the S&P 500 is a big deal. WhenAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) wa ad to the S&P 500, it receiv an immedi 7% bump in it share price.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) receiv a 4% boost upon the news that it would have a place in the index.What' more, the stock continu to benefit for some time as activ fund that are benchmark against the index were compel to buy more share of the heavili weight stocks. Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest compani in the S&P 500. Snap, with it market cap float around $30 billion, would be more moder weight than both, but it would still see similar benefits.Snap knew thi wa a possibilityIn Snap' S-1 file with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't predict whether it decis to make it Class A share non-vot ""will result in advers public or other advers consequences."" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even note that no other compani ha made an IPO with non-vot shares.Whil Snap' capit structur is differ from those of most U.S. companies, it' worth note that it' not the onli compani with non-vot shares. In fact, Alphabet ha two publicli trade share class -- one vote and one non-vot -- and it' includ in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plan to issu two non-vot (Class C) share to current sharehold of ani class under it approv stock split plan.But the fact that investor cannot buy vote share of Snap on the open market make it situat unique.How will it impact investors?Whil have buyer support in the form of institut investor is a nice insur policy, it' not the onli thing that matters. After all, the primari driver of a stock' valu is the underli company' performance. If Snap can continu grow it user base and revenu at a rapid clip, the share price should inevit climb to meet it fundament performance.Ther are a lot of question mark surround Snap, especi in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingli brought on by the increas intens of Facebook' competition. The potenti for sever major index to exclud the stock make it even riskier.10 stock we like better than Snap Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The share lost most of the gain thereaft and remain below the S&P 500, as they have been sinc the election.It' wide believ that Googl won't have as strong a stand with thi govern as it had with the previou one, but not for lack of trying. Compani execut have been visit the White House, but Google' veri public stand against mani of Presid Trump' sentiment are expect to work against it.Google' result had been stellar in 2016. After the customari dip in the first quarter, both revenu and earn rose consist through the year, pull share price along... that is, until the election.Revenu strength ha come from both the search busi as well as new area includ hardware, Play and cloud. Manag said on the last call that there wa ""tremend potential"" in these area and enthus over ""continu develop of non-advertis revenu stream for YouTube.""In that they were probabl refer at least in part to YouTub TV, an expans of the Googl servic that is better known for let you watch thousand of hour of video from a seemingli endless stock.DetailsTh compani ha join with all four major broadcast network (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), so a famili of six can stream live content from 40+ channel at $35 a month. The compani will maintain separ account for each member although onli three can stream at a time.Th price indic that YouTub is probabl still in negoti to add more channel in the few month until it launch in import U.S. citi like New York, Lo Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. The compani plan to expand gradual to other U.S. cities. Intern expans plan weren't mentioned.Also, as far as channel are concerned, there are some import exclusions: HBO, CNN, PBS, the Cartoon Network, TNT, or Viacom channel such as Comedi Central, MTV and VH1, Nickelodeon, Scripps' Food Network and Home and Garden TV.But Googl doe offer you all the good of YouTub (and that includ YouTub Red for origin content, if you are a subscriber). The YouTub TV app for Android/iO also allow you to stream whatev you'r view to Chromecast, so you can make use of the larger TV screen (built-in Chromecast TV will also do the job). At some futur date (the demo fail dure thi announcement), Googl hope that you will be abl to tell your devic via Googl Home or Cast to turn on what you want to see.Th best part? It give you a real DVR experi by allow you to store an unlimit number of your record for up to nine months, quit unheard-of amongst it competitor like DirecTV Now, PlayStat Vue and Sling TV. The Vue allow you to save show from some channel for up to 28 day while Sling TV is still test a servic that will allow you to save up to 100 hour of recordings.I It a Good Deal?That depends.If you'r into tradit TV, you would be spend $80-100 on it, while make do with long-term contracts. YouTub TV is a good deal that way becaus it come for just $35, no string attach while also allow you mobility. Then again, if you like all the content that' still exclus to PayTV, you may want to stick with your current subscription.If you'r more of a netizen, you'r alreadi familiar with the ""skinni bundle"" concept, wherein the most-watched/popular channel are serv at a lower price. Either way, there' plenti of choice.So YouTube, which still focus on user experi more than profit and ha the resourc to go for the best content, may be more capabl of deliv the superior experience.What' In It for Google/YouTube?YouTub ha for long been the go-to destin for onlin video consumpt although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Fre Report) , Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Fre Report) and other also have their own thing. Now that it is get into live TV streaming, it' also pit against tradit oper like AT&T (NYSE:T-Fre Report) with it DirecTV Now, DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH-Fre Report) with it Sling TV and CB with it All Access that are also turn to the Internet to protect their revenues. The market is veri crowded, so price are under pressure.But if data from GfK is to be reli upon, the portion of American home subscrib to a Pay TV servic ha shrunk to 75% with a much smaller 6% use Appl TV-like devic to stream show to a TV. Moreover, the number of TV per home is declin while the number of home without a TV is on the rise (U. Energi Inform Administr survey). Accord to Morningstar, Pay TV execut estim that 10 million home subscrib to broadband onli and not TV.eMarket estim that YouTube' 180 million viewer gener $3 billion last year and Googl recent announc that it surpass a billion hour of daili viewership.

10 Companies Set to Dominate the Next Decade,3/9/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Ani investor would love to get their hand on a crystal ball and take a quick peek at what' go to happen over the next decade. The problem is, those crystal ball are hard to come by, so we all have to settl for look at what compani are do right now -- and attempt to anticip how that will help or hurt them in the future.makeArticleAd();Th good news is that therearecompani posit themselv for growth over the next decade, and set themselv up to domin in their respect markets. Take a look:Imag source: Amazon.1. AmazonAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ha it hand in so mani busi it' hard to keep up. For some companies, that degre of diversif can proof more troubl than it' worth, but Amazon' ha shown it can sell everyth from tablet to it Echo speaker, while simultan creat award-win televis show and manag a massiv onlin consum good marketplace, andstillhav busi bandwidth to power some of the biggest websit through it Amazon Web Servic unit.Th company' abil to diversifi it busi -- while still tie mani of them to it Prime servic -- ha given Amazon a lead over it competitor that won't fade ani time soon.Imag source: Google.2. AlphabetWith a $581 billion market cap, Googl parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a juggernaut of the technolog industry, yet it still innov like a much smaller, scrappier company. Alphabet may still earn most of it revenu -- 99% -- from Google, but that hasn't stop it from make big bet on thedriverless car marketand even moonshot like cure cancer.Among the more than 20 compani under the Alphabet umbrella, there are unit tri to secur major posit in the futur of transportation, artifici intelligence, virtual reality, and the burgeon Internet of Things. Add to that the company' mobil domin with it Android platform, and it new devic like the Pixel Phone and Googl Home and it crystal clear that Alphabet will still be one of the most domin tech giant a decad from now.Imag source: Facebook.3. FacebookEveri day, the world feel like it get a littl bit smaller and slightli more connected, andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) deserv at least partial credit for that. With more than 1.86 billion user on the company' main platform, and more growth come in huge market like India, Facebook show no sign of slow down in the social media space.Th compani plan to have 5 billion user by 2030. Take a minut and rememb that we have 7 billion peopl on the planet right now. That' a hefti goal, but if ani compani can do it it' Facebook. Asid from it main Facebook platform, the compani is invest billion in connect peopl around the world through it WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and is invest heavili in build what CEO Mark Zuckerberg call ""the next comput platform"" -- virtual reality.Imag source: Lockhe Martin.4. Lockhe MartinLockhe Martin(NYSE: LMT) ha gotten some flak for the high price of it F-35 Lightn stealth fighter jet, as Presid Trump ha so kindli point out onTwitter. But despit the criticisms, the F-35 is pois to help Lockhe Martin domin the aerospac industri over the next decade.Consid that the F-35 is expect to be in servic until 2070 and could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenu for the compani over that time span. Sure, Lockhe may further trim the cost of the plane -- as it did recently, when it announc it long-term effort to reduc cost had cut the price on it next batch of 90 plane by $700 million -- but with more than 50 year of revenu expect to come from thi jet family, there' littl reason to be skeptic of Lockheed' dominance.Imag source: Netflix.5. NetflixNot so long ago, the idea ofNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) be capabl of creat original, award-win program would have seem absurd. But over the past few years, the compani ha amass a vast trove of origin content that ha not onli won over critic but also help the compani win new customers. In fact, 57% of the stream service' U.S. subscrib say they sign up for becaus of it origin content.Netflix now boast about 93.8 million subscrib in 190 countries, and it' still growing. The compani face rise competit from Amazon' Prime video service, but say it plan on invest $6 billion in origin content thi year, which should help it fend off rivals. A decad from now, Netflix will have the advantag of that much more origin content product under it belt, and more stream experi than ani of it competitors.Imag source: Disney.6. DisneyWalt Disney(NYSE: DIS) expand it empir back in 2009 when it purchas Marvel Studio for $4 billion, and follow that up with anoth $4 billion purchas -- of Lucasfilm -- in 2012. Those two entertain land-grab alon will provid huge catalyst for the compani over the next decade, as it reap the benefit from theStar Warsfranchise, Marvel movies, merchandise, licens ... you get the picture.Add to all of that the company' long list of theme parks, cruis ships, resorts, and it Pixar Studios, and it' easi to forese Disney hold a power posit the entertain busi for year to come. The compani will have to adapt to a shift pay-TV landscape, and adjust to how those chang will impact the company' all-import ESPN networks. But investor would be wise to rememb that the compani alreadi ha mani decad worth of strategy-shift experience.Imag source: GE.7. Gener ElectricGener Electric(NYSE: GE) ha weather more chang than most compani over it 100-plu year history, and the conglomer recent reinvent itself onc again to benefit from the rapidli evolv industri and technolog landscape.Consid that CEO Jeff Immelt said back in 2015 that hi compani is ""on track to becom a top 10 softwar company."" Softwar may seem like a far cri from the engin turbin and other industri equip GE is known for, but it' anticip the rise of the Industri Internet of Thing (IIoT), in which equip is connect to the Internet, collect data, and then analyz it, help make compani and system more efficient. GE is alreadi well on it way in thi market, and with the IIoT estim to add $14.2 trillion to the global economi by 2030, there' plenti of room for growth.Imag source: Tesla.8. TeslaCompar to other U.S. automakers,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is still in it infancy, but the electr carmak is quickli becom key player in the space. Tesla is prepar to launch it fourth vehicle, the Model 3, later thi year, and estim that it will produc 500,000 car annual start in 2018.That' not so impress when compar to, say,Ford' 2.6 million U.S. vehicl sale last year. But Tesla is bet that the futur of passeng car is electric, and it' build out a vast network of supercharg station across the U. and Europ to fuel them, ha alreadi built the battery-mak Gigafactori to help drive down vehicl costs, and is a leader in the driverless car space. If electr and self-driv vehicl are the future, then the next decad could certainli be domin by Tesla.Imag source: Oracle.9. OracleOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is slowli shift from a hardware-domin sale model to one that gener more recur revenu from softwar and services. It cloud comput revenu wa up 64% year over year in it most recent quarter, and top $1 billion for the first time. Oracl is now the lead cloud comput provid for compani that have 1,000 or more employees, and ha made major invest in the space with acquisit such as cloud provid NetSuite, which it pick up for a cool $9.3 billion.Th shift away from hardwar to softwar and servic may have been slow in come for Oracle, but it' make up for lost time, and bet that it current cloud invest will pay off over the long term. Given it current posit in the tech world, and it rise power in cloud computing, you can bet Oracl will maintain it posit for year to come.Imag source: Nike.10. NikeNo other compani domin the sport apparel world likeNike(NYSE: NKE) , and at thi point, there' virtual no stop it. It ha not onli built one of the strongest brand on the planet, but it also know how to keep the momentum going. Consid that the company' $93 billion market cap allow it do thing like sign a lifetim sponsorship deal with Lebron Jame that' estim to be worth up to $1 billion.But brand is onli part of the company' stay power. Nike ha prove that it can continu innov it product lines, and it ha 40-plu year of success in market them in the right way. Other may sprint faster for a time to gain share in the $320 billion athlet apparel market, but Nike is run a marathon, and it' clear it train harder and ha more stamina than ani of it competitors.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Alphabet and Microsoft Should Start Disclosing Cloud Revenue,3/8/2017,"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is current host it Googl Cloud Next '17 develop conference, which kick off earlier today in San Francisco and run through March 10. Speak at the event, Googl CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he see Googl Cloud as an incred import part of the search giant' future, and not just one of the company' mani side bets. ""To me, Googl Cloud is a natur extens of our mission to make the world' inform access and usable,"" Pichai said.Th distinct is that while search help regular user access information, cloud comput infrastructur and the relat value-ad servic like analyt help the enterpris organ and access their information. The cloud infrastructur market is booming, grow 49% last year to $38.1 billion, accord to market research Canalys. It' expect to jump anoth 46% thi year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so, too, doe the impact on the financi of the major players: Googl Cloud,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Googl data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Imag source: Google.makeArticleAd();A such, the former two should start disclos exactli how much cloud revenu they'r bring in.Follow Amazon' leadI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon wa lead the way in investor transparency, given the e-commerc giant' long-stand refus to share variou oper metric that are pertin to investors. Yet, when it come to AW and cloud revenue, Amazon is do just that; Amazon start share AW financi in 2015. AW revenu wa $12.2 billion last year, translat into $3.1 billion in oper income.Microsoft onli disclos growth rate for Azur (up 93% last quarter), but lack a base number, that data point is less meaningful. We do know that total revenu in Microsoft' intellig cloud segment, which includ Azur among other offerings, wa $6.9 billion last quarter, result in $2.4 billion in oper income. Lack an offici figure, JPMorgan analyst estim Azur revenu for all of 2016 wa $2.7 billion, which would make AW nearli five time bigger.Googl includ Googl Cloud revenu within it Googl other revenu segment, which gener a hair over $10 billion in sale in 2016.

One particularli promin Googl Cloud custom that just went public like spent between $400 million to $450 million last year, and is commit to $400 million per year for thenext five years, so there' that.Shar is caringY could reason argu that AW is far more import to Amazon than it peers' respect cloud businesses, though, specif sinc AW is by far the market leaderandit' such a major contributor to profit due to razor-thin margin in the core e-commerc business. In contrast, Googl and Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each special in softwar and services.Still, the cloud infrastructur market is onli go to becom increasingli import in the year ahead, and investor will want to see the result from the three largest player to assess each company' competitiveness.

For example, it first quarter return are a rel pedestrian 8%.But at year' end, the averag return jump up to 30.7%, nearli four time higher.

Music labels-Spotifi is in complianc with Soni (NYSE:SNE-Fre Report), EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understand dislik the free servic becaus it dismantl album sales, and pay less in royalti than the subscript does.W all rememb Spotify' battl with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entir catalog from the servic becaus she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inher valu place on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Oth musician soon follow in her footsteps.

""We will ask for your express permiss befor access ani of thi data - and we will onli use it for specif purpos that will allow you to custom your Spotifi experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Ov the past few year or so, Spotifi ha been on the hunt for new funding. The compani close fund round in 2012 and 2013, rais $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotifi complet a whop $526 million round of funding, put it at a valuat of roughli $8.5 billion, a move that show investor it desir for expans and new form of content-a few month befor thi fund round, Spotifi announc it plan to add video and podcast from partner like ESPN, NBC, Comedi Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the compani rais $1 billion in convert debt on the promis that it new investor will receiv a 30% discount on share when it file for an IPO. Spotifi will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more everi six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goe public.Thi decis to rais money through convert debt wa a smart move, as Spotifi wa abl to maintain it high valuat without dilut it exist shareholders. It doe suggest the compani is serious think about an IPO, sinc the latest round of fund encourag Spotifi to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that' what wa origin thought.Accord toTechCrunch, Spotifi is appar consid delay it IPO to 2018, with sourc say the compani want to use the time to ""build a better balanc sheet and work on shift it busi model to improv it margins."" But in reality, the delay is like link to Spotify' inabl to final new licens deal with the big record label like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of record music.There' no doubt about Spotify' rapid growth and univers reach, but it remain unprofit mostli becaus of the fee paid to these music labels. The compani supposedli pay a royalti rate of 55% of it sales, and is fight to pay less. Nevertheless, it impress valuation-aTechCrunchsourc hope to target a valuat between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popular will work in their favor when their public debut comes.

With the countdown on to final design and start product of the new iPhone, two detail in particular have seen conflict theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggest AAPL will go with the iPhon Edit - instead of iPhon 8 or 10th anniversari iPhon - for it flagship model.Th websit also feel it ha nail the display size, and agre with a previou report that the new iPhon could arriv significantli later than usual.iPhon 8 = iPhon Edition?What to call the new iPhon is actual a big deal thi year. The regular name sequenc will continu with the iPhon 7s and iPhon 7s Plus. Those are the phone for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expect to releas -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebr a decad in the busi (and hope help to propel sale to stratospher levels)?Th iPhon X, 10th Anniversari iPhon and iPhon 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversari iPhonenextyear? And iPhon 8 would mess up Apple' name scheme for it mainstream models.Appl Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhon Edition. The premium Appl Watch model is the Appl Watch Edition, so the preced ha alreadi been set and it would be consistent. Thi would also solv the continu problem associ with name a new iPhon specif around the 10th anniversary, without mess up the current iPhon name scheme. iPhon Edit make sense.About the New iPhon DisplayOutsid of whether it would be curv or not, or OLE or not, there have been conflict report about the display' size. Most analyst have been call for a 5.8-inch display with bezel practic eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhon that' smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhon 7 Plus.It' a similar approach to whatSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appear to have taken with the Galaxi S8.However,Mac Otakaraha alway maintain - and still insist - that the new iPhon will have a 5-inch display. Which seem weird, given the consum prefer for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnect the dotsand theoriz that the inform given to the Japanes websit is for theusablespace. The remain display area would be where AAPL ha a row of virtual button - a featur that ha alreadi been mention as replac the Home button and mimick the function of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Tak a 5.8-inch display, reserv the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effect a 5-inch display in term of what the owner can make use of.Th math is start to add up.iPhon Edit Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagre with the grow number of analyst who are predict the iPhon 8 - or iPhon Edit - is go to face a delay release.A few day ago,9to5 Macreport the iPhon 7s seri would go into product in July, as expected. But there are rumor that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integr into the new iPhon Edition' display is prove challenging. The ad manufactur complex may push mass product for the new flagship model to September. That would mean sever suppli constraints, includ the possibl that theiPhon Edit would not begin ship until a month after the iPhon 7s, with onli earli pre-ord be deliv in 2017.If the product issu turn out to be true, the result could be problemat … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Appl would face the possibl that potenti iPhon 7s buyer hold off until they can physic compar it against the iPhon Edition, delay that wave of upgrades. Potenti iPhon Edit buyer could also shrug and order the iPhon 7s instead, not wish to wait a few month for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhon Edit together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularli record-smash launch sale weekend it is gun for to celebr that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sale that accompani everi new iPhon releas could be extended. The iPhon 7s would get the first rush, follow by the iPhon Edition.It' possible.A always, stay tuned. At thi stage, everyth we ""know"" about the new iPhon is speculation. But with AAPL' suppli chain start to crank up for production, the piec are begin to fall into place.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

YouTube Officially Enters the Skinny Bundle TV Business,3/7/2017,"In thi segment from theMarket Foolery, the team dig into the latest salvo in the cord-cut war with the releas of YouTub TV, which stand out with it unlimit cloud-bas DVR. And when it come to monetization, be a subsidiari ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) give the servic a seriou advantage.A full transcript follow the video.10 stock we like better than NetflixWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newslett they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, ha tripl the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just reveal what they believ are the10 best stocksfor investor to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of them! That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi video wa record on March 1, 2016.Mac Greer:On Tuesday, YouTub introduc YouTub TV. For $35 a month, you get around 40 stream channels. That includ the major network -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTub is also partner with local TV stations, so you could get local sport and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E, Comedi Central. So, there are some channel miss there. A lot of competit in thi space. I guess the phrase that pay is ""skinni bundle."" There are a lot of skinni bundl with Sling and the like. What do you make of YouTube?David Kretzmann:I think the two advantag that YouTub ha here, potentially, and they say that they are negoti with other content partners, so hope they can get some of those other partner on board onto thi package, but, the two thing that stick out to me that YouTub can do probabl better than anyon else, especi with the current players, they'r offer unlimit cloud-bas DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be abl to record up to nine month of content on YouTube. So, they'r leverag the domin Googl Cloud infrastructur in busi that Alphabetha built up over the years. That' someth you can't do with Sling TV. With Sling TV, you can onli watch it live. You can't record something, you can't set up to record someth ahead of time. You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimit cloud-bas DVR aspect, that' a realli user-friendli aspect that tear into the tradit linear TV model. I think it make the skinni bundl model, or that onlin stream model, much more appeal and attract for users. The other thing that stick out to me that YouTub could probabl do realli well down the road is advertising. You could essentially, what Googl could offer advertis is say, ""We know thi individual, they search for these products, they have these Search term on Google, they have these view habit on YouTube."" I think Googl could arguabl do a better job than anyon els of realli person and target individu ad to users. So, your live TV ad would be differ from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that' necessarili the plan right now right off the bat, but I think down the road, that is someth that could realli play to YouTube' advantage.Matt Argersinger:It' fascin to watch the evolut of the TV digit stream market, whatev you want to call it. But in a way, I almost feel like we'r come full circle. If you think about it, when I learn that YouTub wa go to have ESPN, I thought, that' huge, that' veri compelling. But then, I say, wait, I still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to think to myself, wait, I'm probabl go to need two or three skinni bundles. Plu HBO Now, plusNetflix. Then all of the sudden I'm pay over $100 a month anyway, and then it' like, whi don't I just stick with my cabl subscription?Greer:I need a keyboard to go with my iPad.Argersinger:It' interesting. I think, if you realli ask a consum what they want, they want the true à la cart service. Just give me the 15 channel I want plu HBO and plu Netflix. That' what I want. And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundl continues, and that' someth that cabl compani have done success for decad now. So, it seem like we'r come full circl with the TV market.Greers:Guys, thi realli also seem like kind of a play for the future.Pip Jaffrayhad a recent report that said 26% of teen watch YouTub everi day. As those teen get older, and as they make more and more purchas decisions, mayb YouTub TV becom their television.Argersinger:It' alreadi a tremend brand. If you think about, amazingly, if you think about the Mount Rushmor of onlin properties, YouTub is absolut there right next to Googl which acquired, brilliantly, YouTub some 10 year ago now. Amazing.Kretzmann:Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just report that the amount of content view on YouTub each day is now a billion hour a day. That' up 10X sinc 2012. So, the level of engag that is on YouTub alreadi is staggering. I think thi TV offering, I think thi is one of the more attract TV offerings, asid from those properti that aren't includ in thi initi bundle. But I think with that cloud storage, that make it veri appealing, especi to younger viewer who don't necessarili want to sit down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want to watch it whenev they want. They don't want to watch commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experi perspective, I just think that' far and away abov live TV, whether it' through a tradit cabl packag or onlin streaming. Peopl just want to watch thing on their own terms. I think thi skinni bundl offer with YouTub is move closer to that direction. But like Matt said, it' still not true à la carte. I think, ideally, peopl would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for ESPN, they'd be abl to just pick --Argersinger:$20 for the NFL game that I want to watch thi month.Kretzmann:Right. And potenti just pay for a game. Mayb I'm not an NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or someth like that. I think it'll be interest to see if we move in that direction. I think from a user experi perspective, that' probabl what most peopl would like. But whether or not the cabl compani let that happen, they'll certainli be resist to move in that direction.Greer:How about, best thing you have watch recently, as we close?Argersinger:Let' see ... I watch thi show calledTravelerson Netflix. I don't know if you'v seen it, it' one of those Netflix Origin Series. Realli well done. It' a slow starter, as a lot of these seri are. But by the fourth or fifth episode, I wa addicted, and I think my wife and I bing in like three nights. It wa good stuff.Kretzmann:I recent watch Sneaki Pete --Greer:Solid.Kretzmann:-- which is one of the most recentAmazonOriginals. Also,Th Peopl vs OJ Simpson, that wa on Netflix, that wa great. As someon who wa born in 1992, I miss the OJ story, and now I get it, I get whi peopl are obsess with it. It' a great story.Argersinger:I can't believ that.Kretzmann:I'm catch up on my history.Argersinger:I watch the white Bronco live with my dad.Greer:Speak of catch up, I watchedDumb and Dumberfor the first time with my kids.Argersinger:For the first time? Wow.Greer:Yes, I have never seen it. Father of the year. My eleven year old love it. As did my eight year old.Kretzmann:Qu entertainment.Greer:Yeah, it' high brow.

At yesterday' close price, Facebook is up 261.6% from it IPO price; while Twitter is trade 40.2% down from it IPO price.Undoubtedly, neither the compani nor the stakehold will ever prefer it to becom like Twitter, which is wit declin user base, revenu and earnings. On the contrary, it will like to becom more like Facebook or even better, which ha seen a tremend rise in user base, revenu as well as earnings.Although, it will be quit earli to forecast where the compani will find itself after five year from now; the busi model demonstr both posit and neg aspect follow thestock' recent declin post IPO.What Make it More like FacebookSnap is known for it social media mobil app - Snapchat - which wa found in 2011, and offici launch in 2012. The app allow user to take photo and record videos, as well as facilit edit option and share the same with friends.

Also, the rate at which it is growing, it ha the potenti to reduc the gap with Facebook.Go ahead, the best part of the compani is that it ha been abl to monet the app. The compani doe not follow the typic Internet advertis model of charg per click; rather it charg advertis per day.

Go ahead, the compani project it annual revenu and daili activ user base to reach approxim $2 billion and 221 million, respectively, in 2018.Snap' constant effort in introduc new and uniqu app features, along with it innov advert ideas, will enabl it in achiev it target.Despit this, it will be far lesser than Facebook, which gener $27.6 billion revenu in 2016, and is still growing. However, if Snap achiev it target for 2018, it will certainli be close it gap with Twitter which gener $2.5 billion in revenu and ha been wit a slowdown in growth rate.Whi It May Fall to TwitterLook at the abov discussion, it seem that Snap doe look like Facebook. However, there are a number of challeng which may troubl it in becom the next Facebook and put it in Twitter' shoes.Th major threat come from Facebook which introduc the new ""Stories"" featur at it Instagram app last year. Thi new featur allow user to post photo and video slideshow which disappear after a 24-hour period. Instagram stori directli mirror Snapchat' own stori feature. Reportedly, after thi launch, Snapchat ha record a slowdown in it users' growth rate in the second half of 2016.The second major concern is that even after five year of journey, the compani ha fail to make itself profit just like Twitter befor it IPO. On the contrary, Facebook had made over $1 billion of profit in the fiscal year just befor it IPO in 2012.Furthermore, sinc the earli day of Snapchat, thi disappear messag app ha been associ with sexting. Snapchat ha also dealt with a few other embarrass issues, includ two differ racial insensit filters. All thi may put the compani in unnecessari controversi and bring in unwant investigation.ConclusionInvestor ideal vision Snap to grow like Facebook and not becom Twitter. However, we believ that Facebook' well establish posit in the social media industry, ever-grow user base and the popular Instagram servic are signific threat to Snapchat' growth prospects.In addition, the compani will have a tough task grab market share in the digit ad space, which is mainli domin by Facebook and AlphabetGOOGLaka Google.W to learn more about Snapchat stock?

Will Spotify Stream Into an IPO in 2017?,3/7/2017,"Launch in 2008 by entrepreneur Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyi one of the most popular stream servic on the market today. With it desktop and mobil app version, the compani allow user to search or browse, for free, through it extens music library. Spotifi also offer a ""Premium"" subscript for $9.99 per month that remov advertis and let user download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotifi recent announc that it now ha 100 million monthli activ users, with 50 million pay for the service. Thi achiev ha cement it statu as the biggest subscript music servic by user count, and the leader in the increasingli crowd music stream industry.Argu Spotify' biggest market rival is Apple'sAAPLAppl Music. Launch in 2015, Appl Music is a stream music servic base on Beat Music, which ha drawn listen with playlist made by experts, not algorithms. The servic is also known for it collabor with high-profil musician like Drake and Taylor Swift. It cost $9.99 per month, and user can download music from an extens digit library, just like Spotify. Appl Music offer listen a free, three-month initi trial.There' also Tidal, the Scandinavian stream servic that rapper and mogul Jay Z scoop up back in 2015 for $56 million. It ha a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offer a $19.99 per month option that includ high-fidel sound quality. Like Appl Music, Tidal is known for it partnership with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kany West all exclus debut their latest album on Tidal befor a wider release.Oth top rival includ Rdio, which provid access to onlin radio stations, with differ level of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; PandoraP, one of the origin internet radio companies, goe for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the origin stream music subscript service, ha been around sinc 2001, and is avail for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogl Play Music, which offer onlin music storag and a stream servic for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespit it popularity, Spotifi tend to draw out neg publicity, mainli over debat about it free advertising-support service. Thi servic allow peopl who are prepar to sit through occasion ad to listen to song for free on demand. Music labels-Spotifi is in complianc with SonySNE, EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understand dislik the free servic becaus it dismantl album sales, and pay less in royalti than the subscript does.W all rememb Spotify' battl with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entir catalog from the servic becaus she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inher valu place on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Oth musician soon follow in her footsteps. Iceland singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavail on Spotifi and other stream services, though her back catalogu remain available. And in 2015, British songstress Adel similarli restrict her Grammy-win album25from all stream services-however, you can current listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on it releas date,tellingTimethat ""I believ music should be an event.""Last year, Spotifi wa embroil in issu surround it updat Term and Condit of Use, where in ablog post, the company' user commun manag Candac Katz explain ""We may ask for custom permiss to collect inform from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voic controls, and contacts] from the mobil devic to improv the custom experi and inform product decisions.""Thi unexpectedli caus an uproar, with mani call Spotify' new privaci polici ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledg to unsubscrib from the service. The backlash wa bad enough that CEO Ek wrote anoth blog post, aptli call ""SORRY"" in order to explain that user don't have to share thi inform if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permiss befor access ani of thi data - and we will onli use it for specif purpos that will allow you to custom your Spotifi experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Ov the past few year or so, Spotifi ha been on the hunt for new funding. The compani close fund round in 2012 and 2013, rais $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotifi complet a whop $526 million round of funding, put it at a valuat of roughli $8.5 billion, a move that show investor it desir for expans and new form of content-a few month befor thi fund round, Spotifi announc it plan to add video and podcast from partner like ESPN, NBC, Comedi Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the compani rais $1 billion in convert debt on the promis that it new investor will receiv a 30% discount on share when it file for an IPO. Spotifi will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more everi six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goe public.Thi decis to rais money through convert debt wa a smart move, as Spotifi wa abl to maintain it high valuat without dilut it exist shareholders. It doe suggest the compani is serious think about an IPO, sinc the latest round of fund encourag Spotifi to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that' what wa origin thought.Accord toTechCrunch, Spotifi is appar consid delay it IPO to 2018, with sourc say the compani want to use the time to ""build a better balanc sheet and work on shift it busi model to improv it margins."" But in reality, the delay is like link to Spotify' inabl to final new licens deal with the big record label like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of record music.There' no doubt about Spotify' rapid growth and univers reach, but it remain unprofit mostli becaus of the fee paid to these music labels. The compani supposedli pay a royalti rate of 55% of it sales, and is fight to pay less. Nevertheless, it impress valuation-aTechCrunchsourc hope to target a valuat between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popular will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patienc is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify' excit future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO Next?You may be curiou about the buzz surround Snap' IPO, but should you buy up thi tech stock?

"No, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn’t Expensive",3/7/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhat' particularli interest aboutFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) stock at the moment is that it' rather inexpensive. In fact, it' downright cheap. That perhap seem odd, given that Facebook stock is worth almost $400 billion, not to mention that FB stock is at an all-tim high and that the Facebook stock price ha risen by a factor of eight time in bare four years.makeArticleAd();Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrBut it' true, at least on an earn basis. FB stock trade at about 21x analyst estim for 2017 EPS, and around 20x 2018 figures. Back out the company' roughli $10 per share in cash, the multipl drop to 23.4x for 2017 and, incredibly, just 19x for 2018.TheS&P 500index trade at about 18x-plu 2017 profit and 17x 2018 figures. That means, somewhat incredibly, that Facebook stock trade at a multipl not far abov the averag U.S. larg cap stock.Com off a year where FB grew revenu 57% and doubl oper income, that seem ridicul low. And compar to the post-IPO valuat ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), it seem almost absurd.Ther are some reason for FB' rel low multipl - but not enough, in my opinion. Compar Facebook to SNAP and other high-growth stocks, it' hard to come to anyth but one conclusion. Facebook stock like ha more room to run.Facebook Stock Is Cheaper Than Most High-FlyersWhatev one think of the SNAP IPO, it certainli highlight just how reason Facebook' valuat is in comparison. Snap Inc, of course, is unprofitable, which make price-to-earn comparison impossible. But at the moment, SNAP trade at an enterpris valu to revenu multipl of about 47x. That multipl would valu FB stock at $550 - and all of Facebook stockat about $1.6 trillion.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Buy in MarchObviously, that' a bit of a faceti example. Facebook' revenu growth is expect to slow in 2017, by the company' own admission. Snap, in contrast, still is learn how to actual monet it user base. (Interestingly, SNAP' price per user metric is bare half that of FB.) And Snap' valuat - impact by post-IPO volatil - like isn't as true as that of FB stock.Mor establish peer still highlight an appar discount for Facebook stock, however.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) trade at 65x 2018 analyst estim - a multipl more thantriplethat of FB.Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) is in the same range.Both those compani have higher project growth and lower margin - which impli room to ramp up earn onc those busi mature. It' hardli the case that FB stock should trade at the same levels. But the comparison also seem to impli that Facebook stock is a safer play: while investor in AMZN and NFLX are bet on growth year out, Facebook investor need onli worri about the near future.FB Stock Versu GOOGLTh more interest comparison is between FB andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Alphabet ha growth worri of it own, as fall per-click ad rate have pressur margin for some time. Beyond the core search business, Google' initi have had mix success. Invest in self-driv car and virtual realiti are years, if not decades, away from bear fruit. So-cal IoT (Internet of Things) product like Nest and Googl Home are face tough competit from Amazon' Alexa and a number of startups.But Alphabet stock is valu right in line with Facebook's. Back out the company' nearli $100 per share in net cash, GOOGL trade at 22x 2017 consensu and 19x 2018. Both figur are pretti much right in line with that of FB stock.That doesn't seem right. While Facebook ha admit to slow growth in it core business, Alphabet' core business, Google, is see outright pressure.Mor broadly, the bet on Facebook stock versu Alphabet and Googl is a bet on how consum in the futur will use the internet. And Facebook' continu growth and global domin appear to give it an advantage. That advantag - at the same valuat - would seem to argu for a long posit in FB over GOOGL.I Facebook a Buy Then?Th fact that FB stock is cheaper than peer on it own doesn't suggest a buy. Some investor - and mani analyst - believ SNAP is wildli overvalued. AMZN and NFLX have valuat question of their own. Alphabet stock is at an all-tim high as well. It' not imposs to be right that Facebook is cheaper than all those stock - and yet still see Facebook stock decline, if by less than those peers.And there are risk specif to Facebook stock. The most notabl is whether the platform can keep it dominance. Facebook may not be the nextMyspace- but it' like that at some point, anoth social network compani will come along. Given the fickl tast of younger consumers, in particular, the core question for FB stock is whether it will still bethedomin platform in 20 years, or even 10.Appl Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodFor now, however, that risk seem price in, and then some. We'r near a point where the market is price Facebook like 'just anoth company' - but Facebook isn't just anoth company. It' a domin global player, with huge margins. It' alreadi profit in a way that Snap and evenTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) can onli hope to be. And that domin provid a huge moat around the business: if everyon alreadi is on Facebook, it' even more difficult to get them to leave.So the market doesn't seem to be price FB stock accordingli - even consid the risk involved. A sub-20x forward multipl is fit for a low-growth, establish company. Facebook is establish - but it still isn't anywher near low-growth.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin ha no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlace3 High-Yield Stock of 14%-Plus: Are They Safe?9 High-Yield Dividend Stock To Safeguard Your IncomeTh postNo, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn't Expensiveappear first onInvestorPlace."

For the most part, the momentum look sustain for LOW stock. And here are three reason to keep in mind:Reason No. 1 for Lowe' Stock: Posit Macro EnvironmentAgain, the latest quarterli report show that the compani is on a nice growth path.

Why Baidu Inc. Probably Won't Spin Off iQiyi.com,3/7/2017,"In late February,Baidu's(NASDAQ: BIDU) video stream subsidiari iQiyi rais $1.53 billion in fresh fund to compet more effect with rival sites. Hillhous Capital, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Baidu all purchas the newli issu convert bonds, and Baidu disclos that it had invest $300 million.iQiyi is the largest video stream site in China, but it current face tough competit fromTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Video andAlibaba' Youku Tudou. iQiyi ha been lose money sinc Baidu purchas a major stake in 2012, which ha repeatedli spark call for Baidu to sell or spin-off the compani to boost it profitability.Th iQiyi app for Android tablets. Imag source: Googl Play.makeArticleAd();Last December, theWal Street Journalreport that Baidu wa plan to spin off iQiyi in an IPO which could rais $1 billion. Baidu deni those rumors, and CEO Robin Li reiter after the recent bond offer that the site wa ""a great asset and an import part of the Baidu ecosystem."" Let' take a closer look at iQiyi, and whi Baidu prefer to rais capit through convert bond rather than spin off the compani in an IPO.A brief look at iQiyi' historyBaidu and American privat equiti firm Provid Equiti Partner co-found iQiyi in 2010. In 2012, Baidu bought out Providence' stake to becom the domin investor. It acquir the popular onlin video busi of PPStream the follow year, and launch it own film product divis in 2014. That same year, smartphon giantXiaomiand Shunwei Capit acquir a 10%-15% stake in iQiyi for $300 million.In 2015, it acquir the onlin right to top entertain show in China, Taiwan, and South Korea -- includ the popular Korean varieti showRun Man. In 2016, iQiyi launch in Taiwan, mark it first step outsid of mainland China.Dur last quarter' confer call , Robin Li state that iQiyi ""perform veri well,"" with ""revenu and subscrib number ramp up nicely."" Accord to iResearch' Dec. 2016 numbers, iQiyi' mobil app remain the top video stream app in China, with 125 million daili activ user and 480 million monthli activ users, and stream 335 billion minut of monthli content.iQiyi gener most of it revenu from ads, but it launch a paid servic in 2015 that let subscrib get earlier or exclus access to blockbust shows. iQiyi claim the servic reach 20 million subscrib last June, up from 5 million at the end of May 2015.But profit is toughOn the confer call, Robin Li state that Baidu plan to support iQiyi' ""further growth,"" but note that higher content acquisit cost at the site caus it total content cost to rise from 5.6% of revenu in 2015 to 11% in 2016. That statement rais some concern when we look at Baidu' oper margin over the past five years.Source:YChartsRobin Li still hasn't provid a timelin for iQiyi' bottom line to break even, but CFO Jennif Li note that margin were ""improving"", and that they would continu do so in the future. She also state that to keep cost under control, Baidu will invest more heavili in origin content to ""further strengthen and expand"" it subscript user base.YouTub face the same challengesMak a profit from stream video is veri tough. The platform might gener revenu with ad and subscriptions, but those gain often can't offset the cost of host video on server and content acquisit costs.EvenAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, the biggest stream video platform in the world with over a billion users, remain unprofit due to those pressures. Last October, YouTub CEO Susan Wojcicki state that the 12-year-old site wa ""still in invest mode,"" and that there wa ""no timetable"" for achiev profitability. Like iQiyi, YouTub offer a premium subscript platform, YouTub Red, but the servic reportedli onli had 1.5 million subscrib at the end of last summer.Baidu and Alphabet are will to take loss on iQiyi and YouTub for a simpl reason: stream video tether more user to their ecosystems. If those viewer use iQiyi they'r more like to use other servic -- like Baidu Maps, Search, and Wallet -- instead of servic from rival like Tencent . Both compani can also track watch videos, which give them more data for target ads.Th key takeawayiQiyi will probabl keep lose money for years, but investor shouldn't fret over those losses. The platform bring more user into Baidu' ecosystem, which widen it moat against other compani and ensur that it remain the top internet advertis platform in China. Therefore, investor shouldn't expect Baidu to spin off iQiyi ani more than they expect Alphabet to spin off YouTube.10 stock we like better than BaiduWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?",3/7/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM), whose rapid growth make up for a compel shortag of earnings, warn sharehold that it first quarter may not be what they hope for. Investor have yet to show their feel by flee CRM stock, however.makeArticleAd();Source:TopoI6 Via FlickrInstead, analyst listen to the sooth tone of it earn call, where the compani brag about it past and predict $10 billion in revenu for the come year.Few seem to have notic the fine print.Profit for the first quarterar go to be down. That $10 billion in revenu is not go to repres much growth over the fourth quarter' $2.3 billion sale rate.Slow growth could hammer the stock, whose market cap of $57 billion mean a price to sale ratio of 5.7, assum the compani meet it estimates. That' a ratio compar to that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), onli without the profit of Google.For CRM stock, the futur is now. But perhaps, by forg an allianc withIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM), it futur now might be in it past.Look Beyond the CloudSalesforc ha more than doubl it revenu sinc 2012 base on cloud applications. The company' ticker symbol, CRM, stand for Custom Relationship Management, the first major enterpris databas applic to move from corpor data center into less-expens clouds. But sinc then the compani ha built a full suit of such applications, and all have been successful.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim Low in 2017The enterpris cloud ha been very, veri good for Salesforce.com, and competitor have done more than take notice. Cloud is now the default home of major databas applications. Competitor likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and IBM all now brag about the size of their clouds, and the sophist of enterpris applic built on them.Th S-shape ""sale curve,"" of slow growth in a new market, rocket-lik growth as mass market adopt someth and slower growth onc that is achieved, is approach the end of the line for cloud. CRM stock bull insist that thing like the internet of thingswil keep growth going, but each new nich now bring big-tim competitor with it, such asGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE), which call it industri IoT cloud Predix.Alli TimeA market mature, they consolidate. Competitor pair up, start with alliances, then move natur toward mergers. Have fewer competitor mean they can maintain pricing, and margins, even as growth slows.Thi is whi some analyst are pushinga merger-of-equ that won't happenbetween Salesforc andAdob System Inc.(NASDAQ:ADBE), whose ""Creativ Cloud"" applic would seem a natur fit.Salesforce' strategi ha been to pick-off smaller applic space as they appear, as with it 2016 buy ofDemandware, which serv onlin merchants, acquir for $2.8 billion. The compani made10 acquisit dure 2016, and in Januari it continu thi withSequence, which design user interfaces, a busi now dub UX for User Experience.A a softwar house, rather than a hardwar company, Salesforc ha alway had to manag it host carefully. It origin code came from Oracle, and the compani have had a fraught existence. So over the years, Salesforc ha ad Microsoft andAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) toit partner list, although these relationship are, like love, subject to chang on the first suspicion of betrayal.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!You canadd IBM to the list. Salesforc will now mix it data with IBM' Watson - a quick rout into artifici intellig and, perhaps, into IBM itself.Wher the Ride End for CRM StockI believ the end of the ride for Salesforc is in sight and IBM would make a compel destination. IBM now sell at half it sales, it revenu have been declin for years, and Salesforc could halt that slide. With CEO Virginia Rometti approach 60, often a retir age at Big Blue, Benioff might make a natur successor at age 52.Benioff would also give IBM a more entrepreneuri face, and IBM would give him a much bigger play field on which to perform cloud magic.

"Alexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock … Someday",3/7/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continu to roll along. AMZN stock trade just off all-tim high at the moment, have gain over 2,000% over the past 10 years.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil some investor point to the price-to-earn ratio of Amazon stock as a potenti danger sign, I think that viewi short-sighted. The company' legaci busi continu to chang the face of U.S. retailing. Wit the sharp declin thi week atTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which seem directli attribut to Amazon' onlin success.Of course, onlin retail isn't the onli area where AMZN is have success - or where increas profit can drive Amazon stock higher. The company' Amazon Web Servic (AWS) busi ha becom a domin player in cloud.And, of late, the company' Amazon Echo, built on the Alexa Voic Service, ha ad anoth layer to the bull case for AMZN stock.Though I remain bullish on AMZN, I don't think Alexa realli chang the valu of Amazon stock - at least not yet. Amazon is too big and Amazon Echo usag is too spotty, for Alexa and/or Echo to drive impress sale or profit growth on their own.But both product highlight the success of Amazon' long-term strategy; Alexa, in particular, may becom a bigger point of the AMZN stori in the future.Whi Alexa And Echo Aren't A Big Deal For AMZN Stock YetFor ani other company, Echo would be consid a monster hit. Amazon hasn't broken out sale figures, but it did say in Decemb that it had sold""millions""of Echo devices. An outsid firm peg the numberat over 5 million. With the averag sale price for Amazon like around $100 (includ retail markup and sale of lower-pr Amazon Dots), that impli as mucha half a billion dollarsin sale for AMZN.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowThat' a huge number - for anyon but Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN gener more than $135 billion in revenu in 2016, mean Echo-rel sale were like a fraction of 1% of the overal total. Those sale almost certainli come at higher margin for Amazon than, say, ship a book at the company' usual tini markup. But from a profit standpoint, Echo seem like to offer at most a 1%-2% boost, and thu littl impact on the fair valu of AMZN stock at the moment.Meanwhile, the long-term prospect for Echo aren't complet clear. Usagetend to diminish over time(a trend certainli seen in my household). Echo isn't necessarili be use as a shop device, either. Rather, the predomin use are to set a timer, play music, and listen to news summaries.Al told, while I do think there' a strong bull case for AMZN stock, that bull case isn't necessarili predic on Echo. I wouldn't expect that by the end of the decade, consum across America are order Bounti paper towel via drone through Alexa.But that doesn't mean Alexa doesn't matter for Amazon stock.Whi Alexa (In Particular) Could Be A Big Deal For AMZN StockOf course, part of the geniu of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo is that Amazon' move aren't base on the short-term. For all the complaint about AMZN stock' P/E ratio, the compani almost certainli could cut cost substantially, and boost earnings, ani time it wants.But Amazon continu to play the long game. It continu to expand it address markets, take chanc on major successes. (AW remain the most obviou case of how that strategi ha play out well.)From that standpoint, Echo and Alexa are off to a strong earli start.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesAdmittedly, direct Echo revenu are a tini fraction of overal sales, and Echo-direct e-commerc revenu appear small. But Amazon still benefit from both products. For one, Alexa give the compani a toehold in the import artifici intellig (AI) space. It allow Amazon to take onAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri as well asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Googl Home sit in second place at the moment.For Alexa, in particular, the opportun go beyond Echo. Alexa appear in Amazon Tap and the company' Fire Stick. Amazon wise ha open the platform to third-parti developers. They have creat thousand of so-cal ""skills,"" which creat a virtuou cycle. The more skill there are, the more valuabl Alexa is. The more valuabl Alexa becomes, the more skill are created. And the more consum fall in love with the product.Wher Alexa Goe From HereThat open the door to the real potenti valu in Alexa.Alexa isn't about drive e-commerc sale through Echo. It' about creat the domin AI framework in the world. Alexa can be use in automobiles, to allow for safer multi-tasking. There are endless potenti industri applications. Becaus AMZN wise ha open that system, it' far more like to see those applic than Siri or Google' AI.That'sth valu in Alexa: it possibl seem almost endless at the moment. To be sure, that doesn't mean Amazon necessarili will make billion of dollar off Alexa in two years, or in twenty. That' not the point, however. The point is that Amazon.com continu to innovate, and continu to be an ever-increas part of it consumers' daili lives. From there, the argument goes, the busi end will take care of itself, as will AMZN stock.Certainly, it ha work so far.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceiShar Nasdaq Biotechnolog Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchTh 7 Best ETF for Market-B ReturnsTh postAlexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc.

This Long-Term Trend Makes Facebook an Awesome Buy,3/7/2017,"If you want your market messag to reach a broad audience, there use to be no better option than nation televis commercials. But the growth of digit platform likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl make it easi to reach hundr of million of people. What' more, you can target your messag so it onli reach the most qualifi potenti buyers.That' whi digit ha been eat into televis ad budget -- and whi analyst expect that trend to continu for the forese future. eMarket forecast that digit advertis spend in the U.S. will climb to $113 billion by 2020, while TV ad spend grow much more slowly, reach just $77 billion. Digit spend just surpass televis last year.On of the biggest beneficiari of the shift of ad budget from televis to digit is Facebook.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Facebook.A Super Bowl everi dayFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg onc liken Facebook' reach to the largest televis event. ""We have a Super Bowl on mobil everi day,"" she said.And it' true. Facebook ha 1.23 billion daili activ user -- 1.14 billion on mobil and 180 million in the U.S. and Canada. The Super Bowl earlier thi year attract 111.3 million viewer in the U.S.Grant the Super Bowl last someth like five hour (more if Tom Bradi send it into overtime). The averag Facebook user spend ""just"" 50 minut per day across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, the last of which doesn't yet show ads.However, the averag American watch less televis today than they did a few year ago. View time across all age group fell 11% in the six year end last fall. The trend is more pronounc among younger people. Peopl between 18 and 24 spent 35% less time watch tradit televis dure the second quarter last year compar to the second quarter of 2010, accord to Nielsen.Whil Facebook isn't the onli reason peopl are watch less TV, it present a veri good option for advertis look to replac that lost watch time.Facebook is take a huge share of digit advertis growthDigit advertis is grow rapidly, but that doesn't mean all of that ad spend will go to Facebook. Nonetheless, Facebook ha done an excel job win those new ad dollar flow from televis ad budget to digital.In the third quarter last year, Facebook took 45% of all digit advertis growth. Googl manag to take 54% of advertis growth, leav just 1% of growth for everyon else.Facebook is pois to continu captur a lion' share of digit ad spend growth in the future, too. Display advertis is the largest form of digit advertis today, and eMarket expect that to remain the case in the future. Facebook hold a wide lead in display advertising, bring in around $12 billion in the U.S. last year compar to less than $5 billion for Google.Facebook is also work to attract more video content to it platform, which fit nice with the trend of shift ad budgets. Facebook is reportedli fund new content product for it platform in the hope of seed an entir ecosystem similar to YouTube. YouTub ha proven extrem lucr for Google, and Facebook want in on the billion of digit video advert revenu it gener everi year.Not onli are ad budget shift from televis to digital, Facebook is one of the few compani that' been abl to attract those ad dollar thank to it audienc size, engagement, and ad target capabilities. As the trend continu through the end of the decade, that make Facebook an awesom buy.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV Is Here: What Investors Need to Know,3/6/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.American are chang the way they watch television. More and more custom are show interest in over-the-top stream TV services. Over 200,000 peopl joinedAT&T's(NYSE: T) DirecTVNow in about one month.DISH Network's(NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV ha over 1 million subscribers.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStat Vue is also veri popular.makeArticleAd();Now YouTub -- a subsidiari of Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) compani -- is throw it hat in the ring as well. The compani recent reveal YouTub TV, a slightli differenti televis servic that cost just $35 per month.Here' what investor need to know about YouTub TV.YouTub TV' channel lineup. Imag source: YouTubeIt' miss a lot of tradit cabl networksYouTub focus on sign deal with the big four broadcast companies. As a result, cable-onli media compani such asViacomandTim Warnerar miss from the bundle. No CNN, Comedi Central, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it doe mean cabl network own by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on -- are all there.That' kind of the opposit approach of Sling TV. Sling launch without ani broadcast networks, invit subscrib to buy a televis antenna to supplement the service.Importantly, local network are limit in availability. That' whi YouTub TV is launch onli in market where the media compani own the local broadcast affiliate. Soni tri someth similar befor expand nationwid with a reduc price for subscrib where live local channel are not available.Overall, the channel lineup is somewhat lack compar with compet servic at around the same price point. Custom that sign up earli for DirecTV Now are receiv 100 channel for $35 per month, and new custom can still receiv 60 channel for that price. PlayStat Vue custom can get a similar set of channel for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscrib can get around 50 channel for $40 per month.Th limit geograph reach and channel lineup should reduc the number of subscrib YouTub TV will attract.YouTub is a veteran at video streamingAlthough YouTub TV may lack some of the content avail on other platform at similar price point and the geograph reach of it competition, it ha one major advantage. It alreadi own lead technolog in video streaming.Al three of the aforement competitor suffer major technic difficulti follow their launches. DirecTV Now receiv a lot of bad press as it server were overload make part or all of the servic unusable. YouTube, on the other hand, alreadi stream 1 billion hour of video everi day.Consum may be will to sacrific some channel for more reliabl service. But YouTub still ha to prove that it can deliv where competitor failed.Th bottom line for investorsYouTub TV is a somewhat underwhelm product at launch. With a limit channel lineup and geograph reach, it' unlik to make ani signific impact on YouTube' oper in the near term.In the long term, however, get a viabl product out there now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTub is alreadi offer a few differenti featur such as unlimit cloud DVR, AI power search and person (like back by YouTub viewer data), and the abil to split the account six way so differ user get differ recommendations. If YouTub can get the content deal in place while maintain competit pricing, it could be a big winner in the future.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (C shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That' right -- they think these 10 stock are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor return as of Februari 6, 2017Thi podcast wa record on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcom toIndustri Focus, the podcast that dive into a differ sector of the stock market everi day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so we'r talk about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and join me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extrem well. It' good to hear your voice. It' been awhile, a month or two, sinc we last had a podcast, and I miss you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it' been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-import question.Rosevear:What' the question?O'Reilly:You'r the onli guy I know who can answer thi for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it' veri tiring, I want to know when I'm go to get my self-driv car.Rosevear:Well, it depend on what you mean by get, and realli depend on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touch the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let' back up and defin some term here. Thi system of classif for thing that assist driver ha becom pretti universal. It wa develop by the Societi of Automot Engin in the U.S. The U.S. govern ha adopt it, other govern have adopt it, it' the way all automak talk now. They categor it in six level that are help number from zero to five. A level zero system, there' no automation, the driver doe everything. Thi might even includ warn system like lane departur warning. But, the driver actual ha to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assist that parallel park for you, that kind of stuff. That' a level one system.O'Reilly:Do that includ anti-lock brakes? I'm surpris that' on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Ey of the beholder?Rosevear:Th driver is still execut that. They count that as an intervent system. It' when the car decid to break for you that it start to becom assisted. These emerg stop system that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the level one through five requir some level of sens what' go on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park system where the car spin the wheel for you and back into the spot, that kind of thing, that' a level one. Level two is where it start to get interesting. Thi is the system where you'r on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, mayb the earliest version of Tesla' autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust it speed rel to the car around to you, and it will keep itself in it lane. It' do a littl steer and a littl acceler and deceler on it own. But there still ha to be a human driver, the human driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these system requir you to actual touch the wheel everi minut or two, or someth like that. Level three is when it kind of get into self driving. Thi is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, thi is where Tesla' autopilot is start to go, thi is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruis that will come out on Cadillac soon, thi is where it end up, level three.O'Reilly:Sup Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That' what they call it. That' what they'v been call it for a few years, I'm not complet sure that' what they'r go to call it when it come to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it' self-driv until suddenli it isn't, the driver ha to be readi to grab the wheel. That make it a littl tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.O'Reilly:Th Motley Fool' Dan Spark did that articl about a year ago, he live out in Colorado and he ha a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touch the wheel on the freeway with that thing.Rosevear:Tesla' offici instruct with the origin system where you'r suppos to touch the wheel regularly, they consid it an advanc level two system. I think now they'r into level three territory. The border here is a littl bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is drive itself, period. It doe not need you, but it' limited. Usual what it mean is it' limit to an area that' been mapped, we say it' been geofenced. These system tend to depend on veri highli detail 3D map that show stuff that normal map don't show, like exactli where the curb is within a coupl inch and so forth, so the car can navig precisely, especi on a citi street. So, it' full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steer wheel, but it onli work where the car ha a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to thi in a minut -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherev you want under ani conditions. If it' snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.So, what we'r talk about in the near futur is level four, a car that will self-driv itself. Thi is come soon. But it' limit by it maps. The idea is, gradual the map will expand over time and you'll be abl to drive --O'Reilly:Ar there citi that are be map right now? I'm actual surpris to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is be mapped. Thi is where Uber is do their testing, a lot of it. Thi is actual where Ford' new compani they creat as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google' self-driv car project run it. Thi is basic Ford' softwar team for self-driving, and they'r in Pittsburgh. There' been a lot of map done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, becaus the artifici intellig lab at Carnegi Mellon is the sourc of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the peopl are there. There' some map go on in San Francisco. I know GM' cruis autom subsidiari is do test of level four assist in San Francisco, so they have map go on. Then, there are compani map all over the place. Tesla, I think, is autom some of thi map with the sensor on their exist cars. A compani calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) is go to start do map with sensor on their customers' cars, these are sensor for level two system but they can help do the map for level four. Thi is go to start veri soon, probabl next year for Mobileye. There are privat compani tri to do this, too, hope to be abl to sell the map to the automak or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in thi is, of course, Waymo. Google' been map for year and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You'v seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of camera on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That' how I can see what my dentist' offic look like from across the street. They'r map citi with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybodi is. And it' not just map for Googl Maps, it' map at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car know what to expect as it' driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from it sensors. If it' dark out, if it' foggy, if the lighter system is be buggi for whatev reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Becaus these are safeti systems, there ha to be redund built in. That' the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is thi stuff come out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantli doe these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolut for sure when they'll be readi to ship it. There' also an interest question there that with their owner of their current models, they'v been ship stuff that mayb ha some bug still in it for the owner to bang on. And becaus Tesla owner tend to be earli adopt types, they'r mostli cool with that. As Tesla move into the mass market with it upcom Model 3, someth els we'v talk about, I don't know if they'r go to tighten it up a littl bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, thi partnership of giant auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machin vision specialist that ha done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicli traded, right? For our listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, becaus if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that' as close as it gets. The third compani in thi isIntel, which is design the processors. They'r work togeth on a level four system. We'v talk about thi before. They will have thi avail to ani automak who want it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the car are go to ship in 2019. These thing are incorpor as the car are developed. So, probabl late 2020, earli 2021, peopl will be ship car with thi system in, but those car may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here' what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, ""We'r go to mass produc a level four vehicl start in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we'r not go to sell it at retail. Thi is go to be for car share use in citi and ride hail services, Lyft and Uber and so on."" It' becaus of the maps. They onli want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Field at Ford ha said, ""We'r not even go to give it a steer wheel in this,"" so obvious it ha to have the maps. Again, as the map expand, there'l be more. Ford is say right now that they think they'll have level four function in their retail vehicl 2025-ish. But they alway say that, Bill Ford, execut chairman of Ford, alway says, ""We throw out these dates, but it' alway earlier than I expect."" So, we'll see. Right now they'r say 2025. So, yeah, he says, ""Thi stuff move much faster than we expect."" There' also some other stuff go on. The thing to emphas here, I should back up a littl bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech compani talk about what they'r doing. There will be surpris here. Thi is just, what ha been announced, what we have seen, what we gener know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, onc you go public with someth you get held to it in some capacity, and nobodi want to get egg on their face.Rosevear:Right. And GM origin said they'd launch Super Cruis in 2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a differ name for that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They'r a level three system. They came out a while back and said, ""Wait a minute, we'r not happi with it, we'r go to do more work and make it more advanced. We'r not go to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probabl around there."" But again, they are not hold themselv to a firm date on that. In fact, they'r not hold themselv to a firm date on a lot of thi stuff. Mari Barra' thing is, ""We'll ship it when it' ready."" But what we do know is that GM is plan to actual start build a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedli in the thousands. These will be the electr Chevi Volts. They will be fit with prototyp level four systems, and they will go into thi massiv test with Lyft in sever differ cities. So, when will you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is whi they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it' someth like that. It' a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a drive car? If you'r in D.C., you might get one in sever month from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphon and a Chevi Volt comes. Uber is alreadi do thi on a tini scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 car or someth that are prototyp self-driv vehicl in their fleet. With these things, there are two engin on board. One is readi to grab the wheel and the other one is take note on everyth that' happen with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driv vehicles. So it might not seem all that excit becaus there' somebodi in the front seat, but the car is drive itself, is the idea. Thi is a way to rack up a whole lot of test mile quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these thing out there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless car handl all the roundabout in D.C., that'll be a treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotari up here in New England, we have lot of them too. It'll be interest to see how they handl Boston, which is coloni era street in some area of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they'r made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definit not driverless cars. But, there' other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiari that use to be the Googl Self-Driv Car Project and ha now been set up as a compani to go into busi and commerci thi in some way. Who will partner with them? They had thi littl deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivan as test vehicl that took on their latest prototyp system. They'v been talk toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there' a certain view in the auto industri that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil becaus Googl will want all the data. And then you'r an Android phone maker, and Google' make all the money. That is a great fear. I think everi auto CEO in the world is mind of the exampl of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actual a lot of the sell proposit of the Delphi-Mobiley system, thi is a system develop within the establish auto industri supplier structure. We'll share the map among our fellow automak and so forth, but we'r not sell the data to Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think ha been go on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Googl ha those tini littl white go-kart look driverless car for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them tri to make a buck off of them at all. It' weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and execut name John Krafcik. He had been the presid ofTrueCar, and befor that, he had been in the busi for years. He wa with sever automakers, in manag capacities, execut capacities. He' a guy who know the business, a good guy, smart guy. Hi job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring thi stuff to market somehow. He' been out there talk to automakers. He actual did a realli big present at the North American Intern Auto Show in Detroit in Januari -- I wa go to say last month, but it' March now. He wa talk about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototyp level four system. I think he wa there, in part, fish for automak who might want to have conversation. It' possibl those convers have happen and nobodi is talk about them. The one that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, becaus the latest test vehicl are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:W don't have thi as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listen are on the tip of their tongu with this, they want to hear, what is Appl up to? They have that big plan, and I'v got a push notif fromTh Wall Street Journala year ago that Appl wa go to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pull back on it, they'r do test again. What is Tim Cook scheme right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I rememb when thatWal Street Journalth came out.O'Reilly:Y got the notif too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actual poke a few sourc and end up write a big piec for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morn after that broke, sort of, what doe thi mean, can they actual do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Appl ha so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I rememb you talk about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it' about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factori and they'r bang out car and it' realli high level of qualiti and so forth. Full boat. That' Tim Cook' lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margin in the car business, by Apple' standards, are pretti lousy. A luxuri car busi might make an oper margin of 10-12%. If you'r Porsche, you might make 16%. That' kind of the upper limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possibl that Googl and Appl wind up drop the brain in these car and call it a day? Googl already, they must have ton of data on these car operating.Rosevear:Googl ha made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, ""We'r not build cars, we'r not go to build a car factory, we are not build cars. We'r look for partnerships, we are not build cars."" Appl hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, thi program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the peopl who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the busi have been let go. Peopl work on electr self-driv car are in veri hot demand these days. So, none of these peopl are want for employment. But it wa thought that a lot of those folk were let go, and they realli ratchet down the ambit of the program. They may be aim to do someth where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple- a self drive car built by somebodi else. It' possibl that they will find an automak to partner with, and mayb offer that as a delux ride hail option. My thought when they were origin talk about thi wa that they were go to build the delux Appl version of robot Uber, where it' a littl bit more money but it' a nicer car, and it recogn all your Appl devic and it' thi seamless experience, it see your iPhon and it automat set your seat and your climat and your music and everyth els and all thi stuff, it take exactli where you want to go, and it' just a subscript model, $500 a month for the Appl Car service. That' where I thought they were go to go. Other disagreed. Some of my fellow Fool who are also veri close watcher of thi kind of technolog and particularli close watcher of Appl thought they might actual build a car for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We'r about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magic go to get my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it' probabl a few year beyond that. Somebodi may surpris us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that ha a fairli big map. But I'm think it might be over the next coupl year after that that these start to be avail for retail. I suspect the first one that come out, it will be an expens option on a luxuri car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, onc again, for your time.Rosevear:It' alway a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagin that as thi continu to ramp up, thi will not be our last show about thi topic.Rosevear:Oh, heaven no. We'll be talk about thi for sever year to come. It' a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again!Rosevear:Al right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye. That' it for us, folks.

"6 Things You Didn't Know About Baidu, Inc.",3/6/2017,"Mani tech investor are probabl familiar with the basic fact aboutBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) -- it' the biggest search engin in China, it ha a grow ecosystem of cloud-bas servic likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it benefit greatli from Google' exit from the mainland Chines market in 2010.Those are the bullet point in the growth stori that boost Baidu stock by nearli 1,500% over the past decade. But today, we'll take a look at six lesser-known fact about the ""Chines Google"" which mani investor might have overlooked.Imag source: Author' screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. CEO Robin Li cut hi teeth in the U.S. tech industryAft earn a master' degre in Comput Scienc from the Univers of Buffalo, Baidu co-found and CEO Robin Li work at Dow Jone & Co.' IDD Inform Servic and search compani Infoseek in the 1990s.At IDD, Li develop the softwar for the onlin version ofTh Wall Street Journaland invent hi patent Rankdex site-scor algorithm for SEO rank -- which current power Baidu' search engine. At Infoseek, Li creat the imag search function, which wa subsequ use inDisney' Go.com network. After spend over five year at those two companies, Li return to China and co-found Baidu with investor Eric Xu in earli 2000.2. Baidu is develop driverless carsLik Google, Baidu believ that autonom electr car would be a natur extens of it data mine ecosystem. The compani start test out driverless car on public road in late 2015, and form a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley last April.Imag source: Getti Images.Baidu is power these vehicl with a combin ofNVIDIA' automot chips, HERE Maps, and it own AI algorithms. It' current outsourc product of these vehicl to Chines automakers, and ha declar that it will launch an autonom shuttl bu by 2018.3. It' beef up it AI effortsFor search engin like Baidu and Google, AI play a key role in recogn images, analyz search patterns, and decid what type of target ad will appeal to users. That' whi Baidu hire a lot of top talent in AI -- it chief scientist Andrew Ng previous helm the Googl Brain AI project, and it new augment realiti chief Qi Lu wa previous an AI specialist atMicrosoft.Baidu hasn't been shi about challeng Googl in the AI arm race. In January, it pit it AI program against Google' AlphaGo AI in a seri of facial and voic recognit test in a live TV broadcast.4. Baidu own a small stake in Didi ChuxingBaidu previous invest in Uber' Chines division, but Uber eventu retreat from the market due to tough competit -- especi from market leader Didi Chuxing.

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Gutted? Time to Go Long!,3/6/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company, yet Wall Street expert expect so much more out the GPRO story. They even onc label it as ""a YouTub killer."" I betAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) manag wasn't too worri then. That exuber mark the top for GoPro stock.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)Now, GoPro stock get a downgrad under $9 per share. I'm sure it' no coincid that thi coincid with the IPO ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which had a success offer last week. Money is probabl flock out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhap to recoup some loss there.I think the two have littl in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action camera known for be rug and for activ outdoorsi people. We see video of extrem base jump pro to teen clear a two-foot hedg in their front yard. So far, SNAP appear to captur more gener scenarios.Th hate for GoPro stock should abat eventually. It still ha cool product with veri few high-profil direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case ofTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR), I think someon will eventu figur the stock out. But for thi morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrad from Goldman Sachs.Click to EnlargeBas on that logic, I want to risk a littl on a specul trade go long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the option market to risk even less. My thesi reli on GoPro stock eventu becom attract to old fan who revalu their re-entri levels.I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of invit more technic seller if it lose these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhap in two tranches.Th Bet:Sel the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. Thi is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cent to open per contract. If successful, thi trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay abov my sold spread to win.Yes, it is a gambl to tri and catch fall knives, especi one like GPRO. But I need to add a few specul play to my portfolio, and thi one qualifies. Again, an underli assumpt is that GoPro will eventu survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.Usually, I like to balanc my risk by sell upsid risk. In thi case, however, I won't. GoPro stock ha fallen too far, too fast, and I would be sell risk at a sever discount. If GPRO bounc hard, I would face self-inflict risk against my own thesis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)I could juic my bet by buy upsid calls, but I will wait out a few more trade hour to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn thi trade into an invest yet, however, sinc I'v alreadi said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management' ability.I am not requir to hold my option trade option through their expiration.

But compani that defi descript can sometim be hidden buys.If it' tough to describ Raven, it' even tougher to figur out where the compani -- not to mention it stock -- is like to head in 2017. That' partli due to a huge issu with the compani that should worri investor who are interest in buy top-qual stocks.Raven Industri invent the modern hot air balloon. Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();What it doesRaven Industri wa form in 1956, when a group of businessmen leftGener Mills, of all places, to form an industri balloon company. Over the next few decades, Raven invent the modern hot air balloon and dabbl in other materi scienc industri like fiberglass tanks, parachutes, cold-weath sportswear, and util truck bodies. The compani branch out into the busi of flow system and agricultur control system in the 80 and 90s.Today, Raven still manufactur balloons, covers, liners, and film use in variou applic from grain cover to wastewat pit liner to industri packaging. It also ha robust agricultur control and radar technolog businesses. The ""internet balloons"" develop byAlphabet' Googl to bring broadband access to rural area util Raven' balloon technology.Even with it 2016 performance, Raven is still a small company, with a less than $1 billion market cap. So, let' look at how such a small-yet-diversifi compani manag to crush the market last year.Th Trump factorA you might expect with a small-cap company, Raven' growth wa veri lumpi throughout 2016, in sharp contrast to the much larger 3M and the S&P:RAVNdata byYCharts.But as you can see, one of the biggest jump of the year for the compani came, unsurprisingly, in the wake of Donald Trump' upset win in the Novemb election. Such a win wa seen as a boon forconstruct companiesbecaus of a potenti major infrastructur package, fordefens contractorsbecaus of potenti increas in militari spending, and forenergi companiesbecaus of the potenti remov of environment regulations.Raven Industri oper in all of those fields, manufactur film for the construct industry, surveil balloon and equip for the military, and film to contain frack waste. No wonder the market ha high hope for the compani go into 2017.Of course, consid the amount of opposit on Capitol Hill to some of Presid Trump' polici and proposals, it would be a riski bet to buy Raven' stock sole on specul about hi agenda without more detail about how it might be implement -- and whether Congress is buy in to hi proposals. But there' an even bigger risk for potenti Raven investors.Th red flagRaven is in an unusu situat in that, as of earli February, it wa in non-compli with NASDAQ rule for failur to submit quarterli report to the SEC. Sinc then, the compani ha file five quarterli SEC reports, includ amend Q3 2016 and full-year 2016 reports, as well as an amend Q1 2017 report and Q2 and Q3 reports.Th compani hadn't held an earn confer call sinc March 2016, but it final held one on Februari 16th. On that call, as you can imagine, there wa a heap help of humbl pie serv up by CEO Dan Rhykus. ""I'd like to address our reevalu of our intern control framework and the control defici we identified,"" he began, befor state the following:W are respond with the utmost urgenc and dilig to remedi the situat and to ensur that we maintain a more proactiv approach to adapt the chang in the future, so that our framework design appropri adapt to whatev chang our busi may experi in the futur or to chang in the regulatori environment. As we work to remedi these materi weak and enhanc our control' framework, we will keep you fulli inform and updated.Essentially, manag discov that ""The Company' control relat to the respons to the risk of materi misstat were not effect designed,"" accord to the company' amend 2016 10-K. Specifically, these control issu could -- and did -- lead the compani to misstat item includ goodwill, long-liv assets, incom taxes, and inventori on it quarterli and annual reports.Whil mani of these misstat were compar small -- selling, general, and administr expenses, for example, were revis upward by just $20,000 for FY 2016 -- some were far more significant. Long-liv asset impair loss of $3.8 million, for example, weren't even includ in the origin 2016 10-K, and contribut to a $6.7 million drop in EBIT on the amend report. That in turn help to drop annual EP from $0.23 (original) to $0.13 (restated), a major change.What' of more concern than these identifi issues, however, is the possibl that there are other problem that haven't yet come to light.Investor takeawayThere' certainli a case to be made that -- with it report now up-to-d and with remedi effort under way -- Raven' troubl are behind it, and it' a safe invest move forward. Plus, the company' report third-quart earningswer actual pretti impressive. Oper incom wa up 175% year over year, for example. So mayb I'm be overli cautiou when I say that I don't feel comfort invest in Raven until it can provid concret assur that it ha it hous in order (remember, the compani hasn't yet been abl to guarante the issu are solved).In the third-quart earn call, Rhyku ha promis to keep investor updated, so I'll be eagerli await those updates. In the meantime, there are plenti of other compani that aregener strong earningsthat don't seem to be have the intern problem that Raven is having. If you'r interest in materi scienc stocks, you could consid 3M,despit it middl outlook. For now, though, cautiou investor should probabl look elsewhere.10 stock we like better than Raven IndustriesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Believe It or Not, Apple Came in Dead Last in Customer Loyalty in This $24 Billion Market",3/3/2017,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) know what it' doing. The compani is a market leader in mani fields, and would often rather abandon a product categori rather than struggl on as a minor competitor to bigger and better rivals.But even mighti Appl doe the occasion swing-and-a-miss routine. And some of Cupertino' whiff come in vibrant billion-dollar markets.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Appl rank dead last in the $24 billion file-host marketBrand Keysi a brand consult firm with more than three decad of expertise-build histori under it belt.

The iPhon show up all comer in the smartphon category, no tablet can beat the iPad' consum loyalty, and MacBook walk away with the top rate among laptop brands. In someth of an upset,Appl Musiceven take home the onlin music segment.And then there' the file-storag category. There, Appl doesn't just miss the top spot, but fall all the way to the bottom of 13 rank services.How bad is that result for Apple?To be clear, Brand Key claim that it measur translat directli into futur sale prospect and revenues. Accord to independ metric fromMarket and Markets, cloud storag is a $24 billion market today -- and expect to reach annual sale of $75 billion in just five years.In other words, it look like Appl is leav a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storag servic is not pull it weight, or move the needl for Apple. Instead, consum with a need for off-sit file-storag tool prefer free servic like Brand Keys' categori winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known option such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-plac finisherGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.Appl is not onli miss a signific market opportunity, but leav a lot of that cash for Googl parent Alphabet to grab instead.Appl CEO Tim Cook. Imag source: Apple.Whi is Appl miss the boat?Apple' iCloud is, in mani ways, veri similar to Googl Drive and Dropbox. All three servic allow user to store nearli ani type of file in a central manag cloud server, access from ani network computer. They all come with small storag limit for a free account, all offer a terabyt of storag for $9.99 per month, and come with variou tool for manag your store files. But Appl doe a few thing differently.First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, sign up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the servic is integr into your Appl experi as the destin for system backup files, the default storag locat for file creat in the iWork offic suite, and an option for store user file in newer version of the macO system.Al of thi is design to keep user tightli bound to Apple' multi-devic ecosystem. Onc you'r in, it' not easi to get untangled. Given Apple' massiv market reach, especi in the tablet and smartphon segments, thi alon should make iCloud a winner. Appl CEO Tim Cook introduc the packag as ""a strategi for the next decade"" in 2012.However, Appl never quit deliv on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedli ostrac by other work group within the company, starv of resources, and mostli seen as a necessari evil. Appl is a product company, and iCloud is not a market product on it own -- at least not in it current Apple-centr form. So, thi odd piec of infrastructur machineri is left out in the cold.And there goe Apple' ticket to a $24 billion industri that' also on a rapid growth tear.Googl sure is build it Drive product into everyth from Gmail to mobil photo storag to storag space for corpor accounts. Dropbox is do the same, while on the lookout for anoth buyout bid. And thi market should onli grow faster as theInternet of Thingsgrow up, requir acr of cloud-bas storag space. These compani treat onlin file storag as an import business, valuabl on it own merits.Appl doesn't. Hence, the compani is hold back on promot iCloud, develop it further, or build it into other products, when appropriate. Cupertino miss out on a major growth story, with absolut no loyalti from the custom who do sign up.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It is not immedi obviou how popular the stock is becaus Alphabet trade an A and a C share class, which are treat as seper compani by list put togeth through automation.

I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charli Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Googl ha a huge new moat. In fact, I'v probabl never seen such a wide moat.""Mung ad it wa also fill with sharks. It is imposs to assess a moat without understand competitor and their chanc to success assault a company' market share. In thi case, Munger might have seen the potenti earli while Buffett remain unconvinced. Buffett ha allud to hi biggest mistak as act of omission.Bil Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, step down in 2014. Microsoft run the onli real competit to Googl search. Gate step down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competit landscap from him.In additon, Googl founder Larri Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt travel to Omaha to talk to Buffett when set up the new Alphabet structure, which is mold after Berkshire.Shortli befor the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understand the tech founders' goal for the company.Buffett includ the follow paragraph in the 2017 sharehold letter, put my spider sens on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor assert that 'Bi 2029 no comput - or 'machin intelligence' - will have pass the Ture Test,' which deal with whether a comput can success imperson a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the oppos view. Each back up hi opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win thi bet, but I will confid wager that no comput will ever replic Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundi of Microsoft assert that pilotless plane would routin fli passeng by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Googl argu otherwise. The stake were $1,000 each. To eas ani heartburn Eric might be experienc from hi outsiz exposure, I recent offer to take a piec of hi action. He promptli laid off $500 with me. (I like hi assumpt that I'll be around in 2030 to contribut my payment, should we lose.)""Thi paragraph show Buffett ha been studi the tech world veri hard and is open to the possibl the Ture test will be crack by 2029. He also must have look into the dynam of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent invest into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think bet against Buffett is gener a profit endeavour. What jump out at me is, apparently, Alphabet' chairman and Buffett recent spoke again. They must have spoken for quit some time for the subject of thi casual bet to come up.Al these factor have led me to specul on the potenti of an Alphabet investment.Th piec are fall into place.Buffett ha been studi tech intensely.Berkshir ha made a 180 as far as tech invest go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as have an incred strong moat.Alphabet' valuat is at an attract level given the interest from the valu invest greats. Porat is a great addit to the execut suit ,cover up pre-exist weak in the team.Googl execut have met with Buffett on multipl occas and Schmidt talk to him recently.Th one thing I could see keep Buffett from make an invest is hi distast for stock-bas compensation.

Does Alphabet's Self-Driving Car Lawsuit Spell Disaster for Uber?,3/2/2017,"Last week,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo su Uber for steal some of it key autonom car technology. It doesn't take a lawyer to know that thing don't look good for Uber, but doe thi spell disast for the ride-shar company' self-driv dream? Here' what you need to know.Th not-so-secret dirti detailsNow that thi is in the rearview mirror, it' clear we should'v seen it coming. Accord to Alphabet, former Waymo employe Anthoni Levandowski illeg download 14,000 ""highli confidenti and proprietari files"" in Decemb 2015 that detail the secret softwar and hardwar design for Waymo' LIDAR system. LIDAR system are be develop as the ""eyes"" of most companies' attempt at autonom vehicles, allow them to ""see"" the world around them via million of low-pow laser beam blast out everi second. In Januari 2016, Levandowski start hi own self-driv compani in and, two week later , resign without notic from Waymo. In August 2016, he sold hi compani to Uber for $680 million.IMAG SOURCE: ALPHABET (WAYMO)makeArticleAd();Levandowski and Uber might'v manag to keep thing under the radar, were it not for a LIDAR compon vendor (appar inadvertently) copi Waymo on an email to Uber, in which attach document bore a ""strike resemblance"" to Waymo' own LIDAR designs.Alphabet know a thing or two about computers, and the detail of Levandowski' data dig onli serv to make the alleg act of design theft look even more provable. So what doe thi mean for Alphabet, Uber, and the futur of self-driv car stocks?Blind by the smite?Lawsuit are a norm, not an anomaly, among major corporations. Alphabet itself is under constant legal attack: At the moment, it' face antitrust inquiri in the European Union, Argentina, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea, as well as patent violat and intellectu properti claim by the like ofOracle. As a privat held company, Uber doesn't announc it legal matter in a singl spot, but a quick search turn up hundr of suits.On issu of intellectu property, in particular, lawsuit can get particularli sticky. If proven guilty, Uber will like cough up bucket of cash to Alphabet since, in Alphabet' words, Uber ha avoid ""incur the risk, time, and expens of independ develop their own technology."" By Alphabet' calculation, that includ the $680 million valuat of OttoandUber' entir self-driv program, sinc they believ it would'v otherwis stay stalled.That counterfactu claim is hard to prove, and it may also be difficult to disentangl Uber' own recent advanc in self-driv technology. It' imposs for Uber staff to forget what they now know, and almost as imposs for them to even determin whether what they know is Alphabet' or Uber's.A signal for self-driv car stocksImag source: Getti Images.Mor so than anyth else, thi lawsuit serv as a warn for self-driv car compani and their shareholders. Alphabet, Uber, and other are in a fierc competit to build the best self-driv car out there, and ani attempt to cheat will be met with the full forc of the law.But investor shouldn't equat lawsuit with bankruptcy. Rather, they should take a ""buyer beware"" stanc and ask whether a given lawsuit is a warn sign of a deeper issue. An intellectu properti lawsuit could be an indic of an overli competit compani culture, a short-term issue, or even a lack of creativ talent. Which problem is at the root of the suit could be a better indic about the ultim direct of the corpor defendant' stock than the specif legal details. So if you'r an investor in autonom car companies, rememb to look out for lawsuits, read into them the right things, and make inform choic as you hunt for the biggest potenti winner in thi increasingli competit race.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But what we'v alreadi seen is that simpli be innov isn't enough if a larger competitor can just copi the innovation.Imag source: Snap.Snap' ""innovation"" budget is significantli smaller than competitors'Snap spent $184 million on research and develop (R&D) last year. That' noth compar to Alphabet, Facebook, or evenTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) . Keep in mind, Twitter is reduc it R&D expenditure.Company2016 R&D ExpenseR&D as a Percentag of RevenueSnap$0.18 billion45.4%Alphabet$13.95 billion15.5%Facebook$5.92 billion21.4%Twitter$0.71 billion28.2%Data source: SEC file and compani quarterli reports.To be sure, as a percentag of revenue, Snap reinvest much more than ani of it competitors. But it' unlik Snap will continu invest that high of a percentag of revenu into R&D. It simpli can't afford to if it want to show investor that it ha ani potenti at all of becom profit at some point.Snap' cost of revenu is it biggest expense, and it alreadycommit to spend $3 billion on cloud infrastructur over the next five years.Snap doesn't have the resourc to out-innov it competition, even if it' significantli more focus than ani of them.Even if it doe out-innovate...Snapchat is certainli an innov app. It' chang the way peopl communicate, and it quickli grew veri popular. Growth ha slow in recent months, however, as it competitor -- specif Facebook -- have attempt to copi some of it core functionality.Facebook ha been tri to copi Snapchat ever sinc it tri to buy the compani way back in 2013. While sever attempt were unsuccessful, Facebook kept at it until it found a winner. It recent success withInstagram Storiesdemonstr the risk Snapchat explain in it S-1. It must keep innov to stay ahead of competitor copi it product.But where Snap claim ""it' difficult to use distribut [...] as a competit advantage,"" Facebook is show exactli the opposite. It' develop a huge competit advantag becaus it ha a launch pad for new product like Instagram Stori or Facebook Live. The compani went from nearli 0 to 100 million hour of video view per day in just over a year and a half.To say distribut isn't a competit advantag ignor a signific part of the valu of Facebook' massiv audience. While not everyth it launch succeeds, the odd are stack in Facebook' favor. That' evid from the success of Instagram Stori and other product featur Facebook blatantli borrow from competitor like Twitter, such as live video and trend topics.Distribut isn't a competit advantag for Snap (at least rel to giant like Facebook and Google), but that doesn't mean it' not a competit advantag for Facebook or Google.

Of course, he extol the virtu of hi company' cloud platform, call AW (Amazon Web Services). Meanwhile, the servic wa experienc a major outage.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGranted, the impact on Amazon stock wa fairli minor. Yet, investor should still be concerned. Let' face it, AW is critic for AMZN stock.Last year, thi busi segment report a56% spike in revenu to $12.2 billionand oper incom came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million activ customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Servic essenti subsid the core ecommerc busi - which ha razor-thin margin - but also allow for the heavi invest in effort like video/mus streaming, Alexa and devic like the Kindle.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017A for the AW outage, it last roughlyfour hoursand result in the disrupt of thousand of websit and cloud app across the US. Some of the high-profil compani that were impact includedAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Twitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) andTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO).At the heart of thi wa the failur of the S3 system, which provid for the effici storag of content. The ironi is that AMZN could not even access it own dashboard to deal with the problem - sinc it wa also host on the AW platform!Th Real Impact?It is import to keep the outag in perspective. For the most part, Amazon Web Servic ha a great track record, with uptim that is over 99%. As a result, whenev there is a major outage, there is quit a bit of buzz.Besides, AW is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN ha ad great featur - such as for data analytics, AI (artifici intelligence) and improv secur function - and ha also been dilig with lower pricing. Yet, thi doe not mean the outag is trivial. It' reason to assum that there are mani compani that are evalu the situation. After all, should there be more usag of altern systems?Well, I think so. Note that other internet giant are leverag their own system to provid cloud services, as seen withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Googl is even the main vendor for the fast-growingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which ha sign a$2 billion contract.Oh, and mani old-lin tech oper have been invest heavili in their cloud systems.

All these compani have key advantag like trust brands, global infrastructur and massiv custom bases.Interestingli enough, these compani also have someth else: They provid hybrid solutions, such as a blend of cloud servic and on-premis technologies. Thi mean a custom can place their mission-crit system on privat servers, which would mean no disrupt if there wa an outag of AWS.Bottom Line for AMZN StockOK then, with the outag of AWS, there should still not necessarili panic. The market opportun for the cloud is massiv - with plenti of room for multipl players. What' more, the financi cost for the outag will probabl be immaterial. Accord to Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, he think that there could be a2% drop in revenu for the first quarter.Proct & Gambl Co (PG) Stock Remain a Good Bet for InvestorsIf there are a coupl more outages, however, then the situat could get dicey.

Sinc Januari 2009, Alphabet stock is up 460%, while AT&T stock rose onli 49%. And telecom like AT&T particularli resent the fact that internet compani like Alphabet and Facebook gain these profit while piggyback on the equip the telecom spent ten of billion of dollar installing. You wouldn't be abl to access websit such as thi one or Facebook without the help of a telecom, such as AT&T.On the other hand, when peopl access Facebook or search Google, they are use data, which mean more busi for telecoms.But tech compani hurt telecom when they cannib their revenu with app like Viber and Messeng and WhatsApp. Use WhatsApp is cheaper than send a text message, and ha causedtext messag volumeto decline.Storm Cloud on AT&T' HorizonBut that' not all. Alphabet and Facebook now are look to compet with the core busi of telecom provid such as AT&T. Alphabet'sProject Fi, in collabor withSprint Corp(NYSE:S) andT-Mobil US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), will free user from sign a contract with a singl network. Thi allow user to switch between network depend on which one ha the best signal quality.8 of the Most Overr Stock on Wall Street Right NowAnd that' not all. Alphabet ha more projects, includingProject LoonandGoogl Fiber, in the works. These also threaten telecom like AT&T. And Facebook is do likewise, withFre Basics,Express Wi-Fiand theAquiladron project.Whi are tech compani like Alphabet and Facebook do this? Whi don't they just stick to their core businesses, search and social networks?Well, Alphabet and Facebook deriv most of their revenu from advertising. More peopl receiv access to the internet mean more peopl view ads, and more revenu for Alphabet and Facebook' core businesses. If peopl can't access the internet, they can't bring the two compani revenue.Alphabet and Facebook want to see more peopl use the internet, and if thi mean use drone or balloon to bring access to remot regions, so be it. With greater avail of bandwidth, traffic on their websit will go up.So are Facebook and Alphabet threat to T stock? Well, yes, in some ways. But in other way they may help telecom like AT&T by pioneer open-sourc hardwar and software-defin networking. They have their own reason for do so, and thi could help AT&T by lower the cost of equip which AT&T uses.Facebook/Alphabet vs. T Stock: FriendsIn an articl I wrote inNovember, I discuss Facebook and Alphabet' effort to develop open-sourc network equipment. Currently, compani likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) make money by sell proprietari hardwar and softwar to telecom and internet provid like AT&T.Network equip ha been describ as a""black box,""wher hardwar and softwar are bundl togeth by the same vendor. Softwar from other compani might not run smoothli on one company' hardware. Compani like Cisco can earn high margin on these proprietari products. Rout equip ha not yet beencommoditizedlik other hardware, such as servers.But the develop ofsoftware-defin networkingandnetwork function virtualizationcould chang this. These trend involv use open-sourc softwar and hardwar instead of more expens proprietari versions. Telecom like AT&T can then save money by switch to cheaper, interchangeable""whit box""switch and routers.Alphabet and Facebook are take advantag of this, and make their own network equipment.Facebook develop it ownSDNswitch, theWedge, and open-sourc the Linux-bas softwar to go along with that, FBOSS. It made the design for the Wedgeavail to the publicthrough the Open Comput Project. Custom can order thi from contract manufacturers, which sell it at a low margin, cheaper than Cisco' products. Facebook also releas an open-sourcetransponderthrough theTelecom Infrastructur Project, which focus on network hardwar for telecoms.Facebook hope that releas these to the public will speed up innovation, which will in turn benefit Facebook, a major hardwar user.Similarly, Alphabet built it own massivesoftware-defin network.How doe thi benefit AT&T? Well, GOOG and FB are pioneer a technolog which promis to lower cost for T stock. Through itsDomain 2.0program, AT&T is take advantag of software-defin network and network function virtualization. Last year, AT&T announc it intent tovirtu 75% of it network by 2020. These technolog allow it to do more with less. They appear to bereduc capexat AT&T, which would boost free cash flow and rais T stock. It also expect SDN and NFV to save it money onoper costs.Facebook/Alphabet vs. AT&T: EnemiesBut GOOG and FB also may harm T stock by get into the telecom business.GOOG'sProject Ficonnect user to the network with the best signal at the moment, whether that' Wi-Fi or 4G LTE offer by T-Mobil and Sprint. Normally, mobil phone subscrib must go with one service: AT&T,Verizon Commun Inc(NYSE:VZ), or others. Thi could forc telecom oper to improv their signal qualiti in order to compete.Alphabet also offer Googl Fiber, a high-spe fiber optic servic avail in some select citi in the Unit States. AT&T must feel threaten by this; last year AT&T andComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA)su Nashvilleaft the cityvot to approveGoogl Fiber.Alphabet is also work on the previous mention Project Loon, an effort to deploy telecom equip in balloon 20km from the earth' surface. Sinc the equip in a balloon is higher off the ground than an LTE tower, it can provid a greater area with internet access.Facebook is do likewis with the Aquila drone, Facebook Express Wi-Fi and Facebook Free Basics. Free Basic bring internet access to200 million peoplein countri like Brazil and the Philippines.Impact on AT&TTh harm effect of Facebook and Alphabet on AT&T stock may be a bit overstated.Facebook ha express it intent towork togetherwith telecom to roll out 5G technology.Nick Foxof Alphabet ha state that Alphabet' intent is not to compet with telecom and put them out of business. Indeed, Alphabet is cooper withthre telecomsin Indonesia to test Project Loon.And Alphabet and Facebook may be do telecom like AT&T a favor by bear some of the risk in these ventures. Telecom are more conserv than Facebook and Alphabet and wouldn't want to bear these risk on their own. Telecom like AT&T may benefit from the more effici deploy of telecom equip via balloons, which cover a wider area than towers.Also, mani of these region the two are target are regionswithout much internet access.Facebook and Alphabet wouldn't be threaten AT&T by bring internet access to region in Africa, where T stock deriv littl if ani revenue.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?But some of these undertakings, such as Googl Fiber and Project Fi, will probabl be a headach for AT&T and holder of T stock.So it seem Facebook and Alphabet could best be describ as AT&T' ""frenemies.""A of writing, Luca Hahn did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 MLP to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Potential Stock Market Winners of 2025,3/1/2017,"If you'r a long-term investor, you have to think on an invest time scale that is more than a year or two away. The greatest invest are the one that can gener posit return for decad into the future. It sound simpl at first, but when you start ask yourself question like, ""Where is thi company/stock in 2025?"" it becom much more difficult .So, we ask three of our contributor that veri question. Which compani do you see gener great return for investor all the way out to 2025? Here' a quick rundown as to whi they pick retail bankU.S. Bancorp(NYSE: USB) , solar panel manufacturerFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , and water utilityAmerican Water Works(NYSE: AWK) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();A bank to buy and holdJordan Wathen(U.S. Bancorp):On of the best-manag bank in the country, U.S. Bancorp ha been left out of the post-elect bank stock boom. That' no fault of it own, though. After provis for losses, U.S. Bancorp enjoy a roughli 50-50 split of interest incom and fee income, make it earn less sensit to rate increas like other bank that have seen their share price surge.I think investor are undervalu the downsid protect afford by diversifi sourc of fee income, and overvalu the potenti for higher rate to fuel bank profits. In effect, investor are place too much import on what make bank great over the short term rather than what make them great over the long haul.U.S. Bancorp' histor underwrit perform tell the tale of it conserv culture. At the depth of the financi crisis, net charge-off peak at 2.17% of averag loan in 2010. Though it may seem unremark on an absolut basis, consid that ""retail loans"" made up 33% of it loan book at the time, a major of which were cluster in credit card and home equiti loan that ravag bank across the country.U.S. Bancorp can play offense, too. It deposit franchis give it price power to hold down it cost of deposits, which recent averag just 0.28%. On the asset side of the equation, it commerci loan portfolio should gener increment incom from rate increases.On a recent confer call, a bank execut point out that it commerci custom were use an averag of 25% of their credit lines. One would expect that faster econom growth could bring higher balances, higher benchmark interest rates, and more interest income. U.S. Bancorp ha everyth investor could want in a bank to hold for year at a time.Th sun is still rise on thi invest opportunityTyl Crowe(First Solar):Th solar industri is a difficult-to-understand, and at time frustrating, industri to follow. That' becaus it' both a high-growthanda cyclic industri at the same time. The problem is, too mani investor simpli look at it as the former and neglect to rememb the latter. While overal solar power consumpt grow at near-exponenti rate everi year, panel manufactur like First Solar go through fierc supply-and-demand cycl as new capac and new technolog come online.Thi past year is a great exampl of an industri downturn. The industri is still growing, but it hit a patch of slower growth recent that brought down price for new panel and utility-scal projects. However, the industri is expect to pick back up again in earnest as renew sourc such as solar have move so far down the cost curv that they are now competit with fossil fuel power plant even without subsidies. As technolog improves, cost will continu to decline, and solar will be abl to take a larger market share and expand margins. Keep in mind, global electr demand over the next 25 year will requir that we build 8 time the current gener capac in the U.S.Thi give First Solar an immens growth runway over the next decade, and it is one of the best-posit panel manufactur and utility-scal power develop out there to reap reward from thi opportunity. The compani ha one of the most pristin balanc sheet in the business, it low-cost, thin-film solar panel design is rapidli improv it effici metrics, and it is one of the onli compani in the busi whose return on invest capit have outpac it cost of capit -- which is essenti for a compani to grow and creat wealth over time.Th solar industri still veri much look like the wild west of energy, with new entrant rise and fall quickly, but First Solar is look like the compani that ha the potenti to turn thi fast-grow market into one that realli gener long-term return for investors.A close to a sure-thing, long-term winner as it getsBeth McKenna(American Water Works):I believ American Water Work -- the largest publicli trade water and wastewat util in the Unit State -- is as close as it get to a sure-th 2025 win stock. Moreover, I believ it ha a good shot at significantli outperform the market over the next nearli nine year -- through the end of 2025 -- just as it ha done in the nearly-nin year sinc go public:Data byYCharts.Sinc it April 2008 IPO, American Water' total return of 376% ha crush the S&P 500' return of 108% and pulver the return of popular stocksIBMandGener Electric. Moreover, it' also beat the 212% return of Googl parentAlphabetov thi period -- and in April 2008, thi tech stock wa less than four year off of it hot IPO. These stat should help dispel the widespread belief that all util stock are stodgi slow-growers. Moreover, American Water' return leav underwat the solid 172% return of it closest peer,Aqua America, while also significantli beat the 158% return of the largest electr util on the S&P 500,NextEra Energy.I'm confid American Water' win streak will continu over the long term. The compani suppli the most essenti product in the world, and it' the largest and most geograph divers player in it industry. These latter attribut provid it with greater resourc and opportun than it peer to more effici expand it regul busi by acquisitions. The water industri in the U.S. is extrem fragmented, which mean the potenti acquisit pool (pun intended) is a veri larg one.10 stock we like better than American Water WorksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ultimately, it depend on your time frame.Let' take a look at some potenti strategies:Snapchat IPO: The Long-Term TradeA lot of investor are wondering: Will thi be similar to the open ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR)?Aft all, the perform are a stark contrast. FB ha log a gain of 254% sinc it debut while TWTR ha lost a gruel 62%.8 of the Most Overr Stock on Wall Street Right NowUnfortunately, for the Snapchat IPO, I think there is a better chanc that the return will look more like the latter. Why? Snap Inc look more like a nich operator. The 18-to-34 year-old categori is certainli a valuabl niche, as mani advertis have a tough time reach thi demographic, but the market opportun may prove to be rel small.Accord to Pivot analyst Brian Wieser, the revenu from youth-ori cabl channel like MTV, VH1, Comedi Central and Adult Swim come to roughly$3 billion per year.Besides, if SNAP is unabl to break out of it niche, the compani will certainli be challeng in keep up the growth of it user base. Actually, there ha alreadi been a deceleration. It went from 21 million net add in Q2 of last year to only5 million by Q4.But there are some other issu that could be a problem for long-term holder of Snapchat stock:Th net loss remain significant, come to $514.6 million in 2016. Thi compar to revenu of$404.5 million.Th competit continu to get tougher. To thi end, FB' Instagram ha been essenti match mani of SNAP' core featur (and thi may help explain the deceler in the user growth). Accord to InvestorPlac contributorChri Lau: ""When FB launch Facebook Stori abov the news feed, it took away a reason for millenni to leav the site and use SNAP. Similarly, Instagram Stori usag grew to 150 million daili activ user in just five months.""Ther are sign that Spectacles, which are glass that allow you to take photo and videos, may be lose much of their appeal. Accord to theWal Street Journal, SNAP recent close a pop-up store in New York Citi where ""there were often more employe than shoppers.""SNAP ha a conting liabil of$2 billion. Thi is what the compani must pay - until 2022 - toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for cloud services.Publ sharehold will not have the right to vote. Thi will mean it will be nearli imposs for an activist investor to get ani traction if there are problem with SNAP.Ther is no headquarters, which could make it tough for allow collaboration.Snapchat IPO: The Short-Term PlayWhil the risk factor mention abov are downright scary, they probabl won't amount to much dure the next few months. If anything, the Snapchat IPO is like to be a great vehicl for traders.On key reason for thi is technical: The amount of share on the market will be fairli small. Thi mean it will not take much buy power to move Snapchat stock.Whi Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Alway Be Much Stronger Than SnapchatInterestingli enough, it look like the compani ha been take step to keep the float tight. To thi end, SNAP is requir some investor to notsel 50 million of the 200 million sharesthat will be offered.Of course, there will be some other factor that will help drive the momentum. Keep in mind that SNAP like ha variou deal line up, which should gin up buzz over time. It also help that there ha been a dearth of IPO activ over the last year. Oh, and of course, the overal equiti market have been in a power bull mode, which is alway critic for IPOs.Overall, thing are line up quit nice for the Snapchat IPO, yet thi is probabl not a stock to hold on for too long.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

The Pundits Are Wrong: Snap Is A Buy,2/28/2017,"ByToptal:Origin publish onToptalbyValu Expert Joe Matta.For those who haven't been follow the news sinc Snap (SNAP) announc itsintent to go public, the press cycl ha been on a rollercoast ride. Initi valuat estim in the$20-25bn rangewer quickli follow by a few bolder claim that the IPO may fetch the compani a valuationa high as $40bn. With thi in mind, immedi post-announc commentari wa decis bearish, and larg center around the company' disproportionatelyhigh pricecompar to revenu of onli $405m in 2016.A time ha gone by, more thought analys have shift attent over to Snap' growth prospects, and here signific concern have emerg over the company'sslow user growth, draw comparison to Twitter' (TWTR) lacklusterpost-IPO performance, and thu place seriou question on the purport valuat figures. As a result, Snap ha reportedlylow it expectations, and certain estim expect price to come as low as $14-$16 per share, impli a valuat of$16-19bn.makeArticleAd();Ahead of it expect price (anticip onMarch 1st) we take a look at whether the rumor valuat make sense, and provid our own guidanc on where investor should be price the stock.W find that while overal market concern regard DAU growth are justified, the market is like undervalu the company' ARPU growth prospect and conclud that there is signific upsid on the tabl for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.Growth is the answerA mentioned, initi report larg focus on compar Snap' purport valuat to it revenues, which when compar to it peers, admittedli look veri expens (tabl 1).But such an analysi miss the mark complet in two import ways. Firstly, mani of the compani in Snap' peer univers are not directli compar (Googl (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a search compani and Amazon (AMZN) is an onlin retailer, to name a few). Limit the peer univers to Snap' most directli compar peers, Facebook (FB) and Twitter, is a more appropri juxtaposit (chart 1 and 2).But even when just limit one' comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the matur profil of the respect compani are veri differ and must be account for. A fairer analysi would look at the metric pre-IPO for all three (chart 3 and 4). In do so, reader will notic that the rel valuation, albeit still expensive, look less so than in the prior charts.Ther are still time issu with such a comparison though. For reference,Facebook wa eight year old and Twitter wa sevenat the time of their IPOs. Snap is onli five, and with 2-3 more year of growth under it belt, Snap could be a veri differ company.Moreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobil platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-deliveri still play a domin role. Consid the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is enter a market with a grow user base (mobil take share from desktop) on a deliveri platform that is captur increas user engag (chart 5 and 6).In summary, the differ matur profil coupl with the differ deliveri platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesom comparables-bas approach when assess Snap' valuation. Snap may look expens when compar to it peers, but compar to it peer is not the right approach.With the abov in mind, a Snap-onli analysi make most sense. And such an analysi should almost sole be focus on one thing: growth. For ani compani at Snap' stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to thi end, there are fundament two thing that affect growth go forward:1) Growth in Daili Activ User (DAUs), and2) Growth in Averag Revenu Per User (ARPU)W look at these in turn.DAU Growth: Doubt LoomMuch of the more insight analysi which emerg a few week after the file ha in fact focus on DAU growth. And the hawk are out in flock. Unfortun for Snap,whil initi user growth perform wa impress (chart 7), there ha been a signific downtick in new user join the platform in recent months. Despit outperform both Facebook and Twitter in term of user growth in the six quarter lead up to it IPO, Snap saw quarterli growth rate drop from doubl digit figur to onli 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltri 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).Management' justif for the follow can be found in their S1, wherethey state:""Th rate of net addit Daili Activ User wa rel flat in the earli part of the quarter end Decemb 31, 2016, and acceler in the month of December. Although we have histor experienc lumpi in the growth of our Daili Activ Users, we believ that the flat growth in the earli part of the quarter wa primarili relat to acceler growth in user engag earlier in the year, diminish product performance, and increas competition.Th rate of net addit Daili Activ User acceler in the first half of 2016 compar to the second half of 2015, larg due to increas user engag from product launch and increas adopt rate among older demograph and intern markets. Thi creat a higher baselin of Daili Activ User head into the third and fourth quarters, so increment net addit within these quarter were more difficult even with strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, in mid-2016, we launch sever product and releas multipl updates, which introduc a number of technic issu that diminish the perform of our application. We believ these perform issu result in a reduct in the growth of our Daili Activ Users, particularli among Android user and region with a higher percentag of Android devices. Finally, we also saw increas competit both domest and intern in 2016, as mani of our competitor launch product with similar function to ours.""Th abov explan thu emphas two key potenti caus for the slowdown in growth: technic issu with their Android product, and/or increas competition.Th former,whil problematic, would not be a signific caus for concern. One would think that a compani fund to the tune of $2.6bn and withnearli 2,000 employees(mani of them in engineering) would be abl to solv thi and revert the company' growth cours back to what it wa at the begin of 2016.But the more worri concern revolv around competition. Snap face increas pressur from competitors, particularli Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continu to limit DAU growth go forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat' growth number began suffer in Q3 16 as thi wa exactli when Instagramlaunch Stories, a near-blat copi of Snapchat' namesake.Unfortun for Snap, data regard growth in DAU by geographi onli lend further weight to the competit concerns. In fact, on a geograph basis, much of the slowdown in Snap' DAU appear to have been primarili in the ""Rest of World"" region (chart 9). Given Instagram' significantli larger user base abroad (80% of Instagram' c.300m DAU are international), one could see how the incent for instal Snapchat diminish as Instagram (and other competitors) begin to offer the key featur that Snapchat ha to-dat sold itself on.To summarize, thing don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not onli wa Q4 16 Snap' lowest grow quarter sinc the begin of it publicli avail data, but it wa even slower than that of Facebook, a far more matur compani (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effect convinc investor that it can address it deceler quarter-over-quart DAU growth if it wish to hit the valuat number that have been publicized.Look Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?With the abov in mind, our expect is that Snap, go forward, will experi a user growth profil more akin to Twitter' than to Facebook's.Whil growth will be sustain by it continu popular in the Unit States, competit from Facebook, Instagram andoth intern competitorswil continu to limit Snap' growth internationally.Our base case expect is therefor for an averag of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook' and Twitter' annual averag growth rate of 19.1% and 10.3%, respect (tabl 2). The primari sourc of the growth premium to Twitter deriv from Snapchat' abil to innov on product featur better than Twitter (more on thi below).ARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ampl Upsid RemainingWhilst the abov DAU estim are noth for investor to get excit about, and fall larg in line with most market commentary, stop one' analysi at DAU perform is shortsighted. In particular, it miss the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it come to ARPU growth, we see a radic differ story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth go forward, driven by the follow factors:A more monetization-friendli productA more advantag posit with a key user demographicA gener more monetization-focus manag mindsetAl of these will in turn be boost by gener underli strength in the mobil advertis space. We look at these in turn.Snapchat is a veri monetization-friendli productOn of the most attract featur of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appear to lend itself veri well, arguabl better than it competitors, to monetization. The effect of the platform is larg driven by Snap' abil to innov on product featur and stay ahead of the competition, and thi ha allow Snap to build impress strong posit in imag share and in video.Look first at imag sharing, Snap ha caught up rapidli with it competitor (chart 11) larg thank to it abil to innov with the format (initi with disappear messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implic of thi is signific in that it ha allow Snap to lead the industri in term of develop and deliv sponsor / brand content for thi type of format. For instance, focus on sponsor filters, Snap' abil to reach a larg audienc far exce Facebook despit it significantli smaller user base (chart 12).The growth in imag share and the innov surround it product featur ha posit Snap favor amongst advertisers, allow Snap to strike import partnership with verysignific brandsworldwide. One of the exampl of such campaign that Snap highlightsin it S1relat to how Wendy' blanket it U.S. store with Sponsor Geofilt that promot the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap' measur tool report that the Sponsor Geofilt drove over 42,000 increment peopl to a Wendy' locat within seven day of view the Sponsor Geofilter.Perhap more import than imag sharing, Snap ha develop a domin posit in video, convert it into aseri threat to Facebook. Accord to theKCPB presentation, as of Q1 16 Snap ha surpass Facebook in term of daili video view despit it significantli smaller user base (chart 13).Thi success to date ha been driven by Snap' uniqu approach to the video format. KCPB refer to Snap approach as ""3V Advertising"": (1) Vertic - made for mobil viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, (3) View - alway full screen.Th combin of these three ha made video advertis that much more effect on Snapchat. In fact, accord to the KCPB presentation, outsid of Snapchat mani video ad are ineffect with 81% of peopl mute the ads. However, Snap point out in it S-1 that on average, 60% of all Snap Ad are watch with the sound on.Th abov again point to Snap' effect as a monet platform as well as the manag team' abil to keep innov on product and stay ahead of the curv when it come to marri fun and engag product featur with monet avenues. Arec exampleof success with video would beGatorade' sponsor len dure the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million play in total, 165 million view and an increas of 8 point in purchas intent.Snap ha develop the ultim trifecta - a robust advertis platform that combin commun (chatting), imag creation and sharing, and video content. Thi ha lead to numer market campaign achiev abov averag industri impact, perform and ROI. Thi should support rapid growth of ARPU as more market recogn these benefit and decid to move advertis dollar over to Snap.Snap is veri strong with a key user demographicA the pool of mobil advertis invest dollar rises, more advertis are look to target Millenni and younger demographics. In 2015, Market dedicatedov a third (34%) of their annual market budgetsto target these groups. That figur wa like even greater with teen and ""tweens"" included.Th abov phenomenon is larg becaus Millenni are expect to drive consum spend in the year to come. Millenni are80 million strong, the largest demograph in the Unit States, anda of March 2015, also the largest demograph in the workforce.Thi of cours translat into huge spend power. Estim indic Millenni could be spending$1.4 trillion annual by 2020and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the come years. Even teen and tween are gener signific spend power,spend as much as Babi Boomersin 2015.The issu advertis face is that Millenni are move away from tradit advertis channel to their phone (chart 14). Compani like Snap, as well as it competitors, provid an optim channel through which to target these groups.Fortun for Snap, they seem to have develop a veri strong posit in these age-groups. With 63% of Snap user in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 year of age, Snap ha captur the attent of a highli covet market demograph (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScor report, as such the data doe not perfectli tie with Snap' latest demograph report in it S-1).More importantly, Snap ha becom a lead platform in term of it engag within 18-34 age demograph (chart 16). Facebook is clearli a domin player with massiv reach and signific engagement, but Snapchat is the second lead platform in term of averag monthli minut per visitor. As Snap continu to expand it reach and further penetr thi key age group, Snap should move higher and further to the right on thi chart as it continu to threaten Facebook' leadership.Thi all bode veri well for Snap. The compani ha continu to rapidli expand it reach within the 18-24 categori while also broaden it penetr within older age groups. As of Decemb 2015, accord to comScore, more than three-out-of-f 18-24 year old now activ use Snapchat, with older age group also on the rise (chart 17).With a domin in the Millennial, Teen and Tween demographics, the second lead platform in term of monthli engag and further expans of it reach within each of those key demograph Snap should receiv an outsiz portion of advertis dollar go forward. Thi should support rapid ARPU expans in the come years.Snap manag is more monet focusedPut the abov two tactic point aside, the most encourag thing about Snap is that manag ha consist shown a greater predisposit and knack for convert fun new product featur into monet avenues. In short: Snap manag appear to be excel at monetization.And the result bear thi out. When compar to Facebook and Twitter, Snap start monet earlier, and ha grown faster in term of ARPU than both of it comparables, despit be sever year ""younger"" as a compani (chart 18 and 19).Admittedly, claim that Snap is simpli better at monet than it comp is a subject and difficult-to-prov assertion. However, if you believ this, then what make thi an even more interest point is when you consid how much upsid could still be left for Snap to capture. To thi end, a simpl side-by-sid comparison of ARPU number with Facebook and Twitter suggest that Snap' ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).For us, Snap' impress histor perform in ARPU driven by it clear abil to innov in product and monetization, combin with the tremend upsid still there for the taking, point to strong and rapid catch-up in term of ARPU in the year to come. It is therefor not surpris to us that after havingfail to acquireSnapchat, Facebook ha now revert torepl it featur consistently.Overal Industri Growth will keep support Snap ARPU GrowthAsid from the intrins strength of Snap as a company, it' also obviou that overal underli industri strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the come year (although the extent to which thi will be remain a question).Accord to areport from IDC, ad spend is expect to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobil specif spend grow 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media market in particular is expect to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019,comfort overtakingnewspap advertis by 2020.Moreover,accord to KPCB, there is a $22bn market opportun in mobil advertis as it is the onli grow outlet in term of percent of consumpt time. Thi should continu to encourag market to shift away from more legaci outlet like TV and print and into mobil (chart 21). Given that Snap' entir advertis inventori is on mobile, a grow pool of total mobil advertis dollar will certainli benefit Snap go forward.Rabbit from a hat: Ancillari product launch may add further upsid to ARPUFor further revenu upsid one can't overlook Snap' potenti to develop ancillari products.Snap ha alreadi demonstr a willing to explor new product categori with the launch of Spectacl in Septemb 2016, it first ever hardwar product. New product develop outsid of softwar could potenti provid Snap with a veri interest monet model that is differ from their competitor (FB is explor VR) and a uniqu way of own more of the user' share of mind.Spectacl are wearabl glass with a built-in camera that link seamlessli to a smartphon to creat uniqu Snap from a ""human perspective."" The compani view Spectacl as an extens of Snapchat and intend to use the glass to creat a uniqu circular format for video as oppos to the standard rectangular view perspect (onc again reinvent the standard video deliveri model).Spectacl do gener revenu for Snap, but for 2016 the revenu were not materi and, thus, not report in the company' filing. Go forward, Spectacl could repres a much larger portion of Snap' revenue.It' unclear what other type of new product Snap is plan to bring to market, but Snap ha demonstr a strong abil to creat innov and sticki product that drive increment user growth and revenu (chart 22). Expect each new product introduct to be strateg in drive user growth, enhanc user engagement, and increas share of mind, all thing that should bring creat even greater revenu opportun for Snap.ARPU Growth Go Forward: A Monet MachineLook ahead and given all of the above, our expect is that despit slow user growth, Snap' platform should support veri strong ARPU growth go forward. We see Snap' ARPU catch up with Facebook' in the next five years, and it would not surpris us if it surpass it further out. In other words, despit Twitter-lik user growth, Snap is like to experi more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.Th biggest risk to thi scenario play out mainli relat to Facebook and other competitors' abil to replic Snap' featur both quickli and effectively. Should thi be the case, Snap' leadership in product innov will like fail to spill over into signific ARPU growth. However, should competitor struggl to play the ""catch-up game"" well enough, Snap will like see ARPU growth rate in line with what we predict below. The latter ha been interestingli describ as the ""Gingerbread strategy"" inthi article.With that in mind we anticip two possibl ARPU growth trajectories. Our downsid case project are more in line with other commentari and essenti consid the latter scenario of product innov follow by effect catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predic on management' abil to keep innov on product, and competitors' rel ineffect at copi such features.Th number of both case are display in tabl 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticip north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catch up to Facebook' 2016 number by 2019/2020.Put Thi All Together: What is Snap worth?With all of the abov in mind, we can now proceed to calcul our estim valuat for Snap. We first look at what Snap' revenu will look like go forward, base on our DAU and ARPU assumpt outlin above, and then move into a valuat analysi use these revenu estimates.Financi ForecastsOur financi forecast are summar in Tabl 4, but the headlin number we want to highlight are the following:DAU growth in between Twitter and Facebook' post-IPO performance, reach 246 million DAU by 2019Strong ARPU catch-up and growth, reach $6.88 per user by 2019, nearli equal Facebook' current 2016 ARPU numbers, in the Base CaseMor limit ARPU growth in the Downsid Case, reach $4.80 by 2019, in line with Twitter' current ARPU numbersTot Revenu of $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion achiev in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Base CaseTot Revenu of $1.3 billion and $2.7billion achiev in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Downsid CaseValuationW valu Snap on an EV / Revenu basi use a target multipl rang of 6.0x to 10.0x deriv from the midpoint of the rang between Facebook and Twitter current trade multiples. On the one hand, Snap' more limit DAU growth warrant a lower multipl than Facebook's, but on the other hand it more favour ARPU prospect warrant a premium to Twitter' multiple. We appli these multipl to forward 2018 revenu estim to account for Snap be a younger compani than both of it comps. Our valuat estim are summaris in Tabl 5 below, but the key takeaway are as follows:Despit limit DAU growth, our base case ARPU assumpt impli a valuat of c. $30bn base off a 8.0x multipl on 2018 forward revenu estimatesIn our bearish case, we come out at $22bn on 2018 forward revenu estimates, in line but still slightli abov more recent price targets.Overall, we see strong upsid potenti for Snap go forward, with the valuat potenti rise to nearli $50bn assum greater matur of their comp justifi use Snap' 2019 forward revenu estim for the valuation, conclud that thi stock is a buy.Snap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPUIn mani respects, one could say that the Snap IPO herald a more gener shift in social media platform from build for user growth to build for user engag and monetization. Sinc inception, Snap ha alway felt more like a blend between a tradit social media app and a game app. The more play natur of the platform ha in turn translat posit into monet and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap' peer did at their equival stage of their lifecycle. Whether a purpos manag strategi or not, Snap seem better built for monetization.Thi of cours is occur concurr with an increas shift in advertis spend from tradit media outlet to online/digit and particular mobil channels. In mani ways, it feel like advertis are reach the tip point of shift a major of their dollar to social media and ""new media"" channels.A a result, we view Snap' futur financi prospect veri favorably, and per our analysi above, conclud that Snap is a buy.

Why Was This Analyst So Wrong About Twitter Inc?,2/28/2017,"Sometim go against the grain with a contrarian view pay off for Wall Street analysts. Other times, it blow up in their face and hurt investor who took their advice. The latter recent happen to BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, who boldli upgradedTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $25 -- right befor the social network' dismal fourth quarter earningssank the stock.Al analyst and investor eventu make bad calls, but Greenfield' upgrad rais eyebrows, sinc it clearli went against the popular view that Twitter wa stuck in a termin decline. Let' take a look at whi Greenfield believ that Twitter could make a comeback, and whi those bullish idea might be misguided.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Whi did BTIG believ in Twitter?Greenfield believ that sever catalyst would help Twitter recover. First, he saw a ""meaning uptick"" in download of the iO app, which he attribut to the U.S. elect and Presid Trump' wide cover use of the platform. Second, he note that a recent CivicSci survey show an increas in the app' daili activ user (DAUs). Greenfield cite those two factor as evid of higher user engagement.A user growth and engag rebound, Greenfield believ that advertis and potenti suitor could return. The analyst doesn't ""expect immedi financi benefits"" in the first half of the year, but believ that Twitter' ""second half 2017 revenu could exceed investors' expect with 2018 well abov consensus.""Whi were those idea misguided?Greenfield' claim that iO download were rise is true. Accord to App Annie, Twitter' iO rank in the U.S. surg from 33th to 8th place between Feb. 29, 2016 and Jan. 20, 2017. Unfortunately, that growth quickli revers after Trump' inauguration, and the app slip back to 26th place at the end of February.Greenfield' claim that DAU are rise wa also confirm in Twitter' earn report, which reveal that it DAU rose 11% annual dure the quarter -- an acceler from 7% growth in the third quarter, 5% growth in the second quarter, and 3% growth in the first quarter. However, Twitter left out one crucial number -- the actual number of DAUs.That figur matter becaus Twitter' monthli activ user (MAUs) onli rose 4% annual to 319 million dure the quarter. If Twitter' DAU growth is outpac it MAU growth, it mean a small group of power user are tweet more frequently, but the platform still isn't reel in casual users. Twitter also hasn't made it easi for casual user to get started, sinc it still hasn't adequ addressedcommon complaintslik it 140-charact limit, non-thread replies, and the prolifer of fake and spam account -- all of which make user-to-us interact difficult.Whi advertis and potenti buyer aren't come backSom of the company' decis over the last few year have set it up for an uphil battl in win back advertis and potenti acquirers.First, former CEO Dick Costolo pivot Twitter toward a ""cost per engagement"" model which let advertis pay for onli the interact (tweets, likes, retweets) that they wanted.At the time, Costolo believ that move would help it reach smaller busi with limit advertis budgets. Instead, the move backfir and allow larg custom to pay less money for fewer clicks. Twitter still hasn't recov from that move -- that' probabl whi it core advertis revenu fell 0.5% annual last quarter.A for a buyout, CEO Jack Dorsey and previou suitor seem to have abandon the idea. In January,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googleagre to buymost of Twitter' develop product for an undisclos sum. That sale indic that Twitter could sell off non-cor busi to gener fresh cash -- which might be attract to compani like Google, which valu Twitter' tech but don't want it stall out user base, sluggish advertis business, and controversi regard bullying, trolling, and illeg accounts. Dorsey'srec purchaseof $7 million in share also indic that the co-found believ in Twitter' long-term futur -- which might mean that a buyout is off the table.B estim in 2017 and 2018 might not matterLastly, Greenfield' suggest that Twitter could beat expect in 2017 and 2018 isn't as bullish as it sounds. Analyst expect Twitter' revenu to fall 6.4% thi year and rebound 7.5% next year -- indic that Twitter' 2018 revenu will remain nearli flat from 2016 levels. Beat those estim won't put Twitter back on the track to higher growth.Greenfield might believ that time will eventu prove hi thesi right. However, Twitter' slump sale growth, the sluggish evolut of it platform, and a CEO that split hi time between two compani all indic that thing could get much wors befor they get better.10 stock we like better than TwitterWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Better Buy: Facebook Inc vs. Netflix, Inc.",2/28/2017,"These two are in rare company. How mani other organ have rule the age of the internet quit likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) orNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ? We spend countless hour on each site keep up with friend and binge-watch our favorit shows.In fact, with the addit ofAlphabetandAmazon, I think we'd be hard-press to find more influenti compani in today' society. That fact ha not been lost on investors. Over the past four years, both stock have quintupl in value.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();But which is a better buy today? That' a difficult question to answer, though we can get a better understand for what we'r buy by look at the question through three differ lenses.Sustain competit advantagesIf I had one word of advic for begin investors, it would be this: Spend the bulk of your time investig a company' sustain competit advantages. Often refer to as a ""moat"" by investors, sustain competit advantag are what keep custom come back for more everi year and consist keep the competit at bay.Netflix benefit from, as I see it, three differ type of moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not withstanding, the compani ha won over legion of loyal custom who appreci the servic and it origin content. That origin content is key, as it is get peopl hook into the Netflix ecosystem.Manag is abl to target it origin content becaus it ha more data on our view habit than ani other organ in the histori of the world. That also give the compani the upper hand when it come to pay for content from third-parti providers. Imagin the negoti table: Netflix know just how popular certain show are to it viewer and how valuabl it is. The other side ha no idea. That asymmetri provid price power.Imag source: Getti Images.Finally, Netflix benefit from a sneaki type of moat I onlyrecentlycam to appreciate. Onc custom sign on, the cost of the monthli plan is so low -- and the payment fulli autom -- that a user would have to be highli motiv tocancelhis/h membership.Facebook, on the other hand, benefit from one of the most power moat in the world: the network effect. With each addit member who join Facebook, non-memb are incentiv to join as a way of keep up with their friend and family. It' a virtuou cycl that is in full effect. Even though the compani alreadi ha over 1billiondaili activ users, it roster continu to grow -- up 18% year over year.Not onli that but Facebook get essenti all of it content for free. That' often underappreci by investors. Imagin what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for it shows.At the end of the day, both of these compani have power moats. In year past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But my realiz of how easi it is for Netflix to keep subscrib -- and how effect origin content is at bring in new user -- is enough to call thi a draw.Winn = TieFinanci fortitudeWhil conserv investor love see cash return to them via dividend and more aggress investor love see cash reinvest in a company' growth prospects, there' someth to be said for cash.Everi compani will experi difficult financi times, and the compani that enter those phase with lot of cash will prosper. They will have the flexibl to outspend rival and gain market share, repurchas stock on the cheap, and even make strateg acquisitions. Debt-laden compani will be in the opposit boat, forc to satisfi the whim of their creditors.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFre Cash FlowNetflix$1.7 billion$3.4 billion$0.2 billion($1.6 billion)Facebook$30 billion$0$10.2 billion$11.6 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includ cash, short, and long-term investments.Here, we have a veri clear winner. Netflix is spend lot of cash on it intern expans and origin programing. That' a great strategi because, as mention above, onc custom are lock in, they'r a reliabl sourc of recur revenue.But with that strategi come financi fragility. Netflix is free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machin with no long-term debt whatsoever.Winn = FacebookValuationFinally, we have valuation. While thi isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metric we can consult to give us an idea of how expens each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioNetflix340N/A1.6Facebook32341.1Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E repres figur from non-GAAP earnings.Her again, we have a clear winner. Becaus of the aforement spending, Netflix isveryexpens base on tradit metrics.Facebook, on the other hand, look like a pretti good deal at today' prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be describ as ""cheap,"" the compani increas earn by 86% last year, and is expect to grow by 28% move forward.Winn = FacebookTh winner is...So there you have it: While both compani have power moats, Facebook ha a better balanc sheet and appear to be a better valu at today' prices. You realli can't go wrong by invest in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at today' levels. That help explain whi it account for 14% of my real-lif holdings, while Netflix clock in at just 2%.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc's Chatbots Hit a 70% Failure Rate,2/28/2017,"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedli scale back it chatbot effort on Messeng after the program fail to fulfil 70% of users' requests.Th Informationreport that those request couldn't be handl without human agents, and bot built by outsid develop ""had issues"" becaus the ""technolog to understand human request wasn't develop enough.""So instead of build a larg ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messeng bot to handl ""a narrow set of cases, so user aren't disappoint by the limit of automation."" Let' see what thi strateg shift mean for Facebook' AI efforts, and whether or not chatbot will ever becom meaning tool for the social network.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Understand Facebook' AI strategyArtifici intellig play a vital role in help Facebook track user and deliv target ads. By use AI to scan a user' statu updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, link apps, and other data, Facebook gener digit profil of user which help it deliv target ad to their News Feeds. In 2013, Facebook launch the FAIR (Facebook Artifici Intellig Research) unit to continu upgrad those AI capabilities.That' where Messeng come in. In 2014, Facebook forc user to download the stand-alon Messeng app to keep chatting. That move -- whichclearli mirroredTencent's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundat for Messeng to becom a ""platform"" which could eventu offer ride hailing, mobil payments, deliveries, game and other servic from a singl app.Facebook' Messeng app. Imag source: Googl Play.That move would give Facebook an ""O within an OS"" to counter the iO App Store andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl Play. Facebook' next step would be toreplaceapp with Messeng chatbots, which were introduc last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entir mobil app store model upsid down.Th prematur rise of the chatbotsIn theory, a busi chatbot could answer questions, make purchas suggestions, process orders, and send ship updat to customers. For customers, have ""conversations"" with these bot would feel more natur than scroll and click through a mobil app. Compani could also cut cost by reduc the number of human custom servic representatives.Facebook tether those bot to Messeng for Business, which provid a live custom servic chat channel for a larg number of businesses. Busi can choos to put a human or a chatbot to handl queri on their end. Thi idea attract a lot of earli adopt -- 30,000 Facebook bot were alreadi activ on Messeng as of last September.But just as Googl struggl with low-qual app over the years, Facebook' ecosystem quickli becam bog down with poorli produc chatbots. Badli made bot could annoy custom and tarnish a company' imag -- so the compani decid it' a better idea to send the bot back to the draw board than expand the overal ecosystem.Facebook should'v seen thi comingTh limit of AI-pow bot were alreadi clear when Facebook launch it chatbot API last year. For example,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) launch it chatbot Tay onTwittera an experimentlast March. Within 24 hours, Tay start tweet racist and sexist comments, forc Microsoft to abruptli pull the plug and issu an apology. Tencent ha also struggl to purg spam and scam bot on WeChat sinc it start let million of account creat their own bots.Facebook' AI tech also wasn't that impress prior to the arriv of it chatbots. It News Feed struggl to discern fake news headlin from real ones, and it Messenger-bas virtual assist M hasn't gain much ground against Googl Now or Siri.Edison Invest analyst Richard Windsor -- who recent call Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compar to Googl -- state that ""when Facebook tri to autom it systems, thing alway go wrong."" He also point out that while Facebook ha hire plenti of AI talent, it simpli hasn't been work on AI ""for nearli long enough"" to challeng market leader like Google.So what' next for Facebook' AI efforts?Despit those missteps, Facebook probabl won't stop invest in chatbot anytim soon. The compani is expect to introduc new AI plan at it F8 confer in April, which will like includ way to boost the quality, not quantity, of it Messeng bots. It could also introduc more way to tether bot into other Messeng featur -- like payment and game -- to increas the app' appeal as a stand-alon platform.10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Suing Uber Over Self-Driving Car Technology,2/28/2017,"Uber badli need self-driv car technolog becaus it wa in danger of get push out of the market if mani cheaper ride-hail servic use self-driv technolog (no human driver) were to enter the market.

The company, which origin use LiDAR base system from Velodyne, later develop a number of such system for close-range, mid-rang and long-rang ""vision"" of self-driv cars.

He then download a new OS to hi company-suppli laptop that effect delet information, in a rather elabor attempt to eras hi activity.

As an initi response, a Uber repres said, ""We take the alleg made against Otto and Uber employe serious and we will review thi matter carefully.""Later, thi chang to: ""We are incred proud of the progress that our team ha made… We have review Waymo' claim and determin them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigor defend against them in court. In the meantime, we will continu our hard work to bring self-driv benefit to the world.""Oth DetailsTh discoveri of theft wa intriguing: A Uber supplier had inadvert copi a Googl execut in a mail titl ""Otto files."" The mail wa be sent to peopl at Uber that Googl think were involv with Uber' self-driv technology.Googl found that the replic technology, the diagram of which were attach to the email, bore a close resembl to it proprietari technolog and wa base on Waymo trade secrets.

He ha been work on autonom vehicl for some time, found a startup call 510 system in 2001 that he later sold to Google. The technolog thi startup brought is the foundat of Google' technology.At the end of the day, engin do like to move around becaus it' more profit and allow them liberti that aren't avail for stick around at a big corpor hous like Google.

Alphabet’s Waymo Leads the Field in Driverless Cars,2/28/2017,"Imag Source: WaymoAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ha been crush it rival in self-driv cars, accord to the latest data from the California Depart of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet' driverless car divis -- Waymo -- report the lowest disengag rate among all the compani test self-driv car on California road last year, mean there were fewer time when the autonom drive system had to be shut down.makeArticleAd();How thing lookTh California DMV defin disengag as either a failur of autonom technolog or the requir of human intervent to switch off the autonom mode. A lower disengag rate indic that Waymo' driverless car have becom better at drive themselves.In fact, accord to thi data, Waymo is not just better than the rest; it is beat it rival by a huge margin as it car had a meager disengag rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonom miles. Thi is down from the 0.80 disengag rate in 2015. Thi seem even more impress in light of the fact that Waymo vehicl cover longer distanc than rival and, asTechcnrunchreports, Waymo' autonom vehicl and their engin are set to err on the side of caution when decid to disengage.ManufacturerAutonom mile driven in 2016DisengagementsDisengag per 1,000 milesBMW63811.6Waymo635,8681240.2Ford59035.1Nissan4,099286.8Mercedes-Benz673183271.9Tesla550183332.7Data Source: California DMVA low disengag rate and more mile driven indic that Alphabet' moonshot self-driv technolog is the most success on California roads. More importantly, the lower disengag rate ha been accomplish mostli in suburban and citi drive conditions. Waymo, therefore, seem to be closer than ani other compani to launch it self-driv project commercially.Thi is not surpris as Alphabet (then Google) began work on driverless car in 2009 and ha the first-mov advantage. Sinc then, it autonom car have driven over 2 million miles, with most of the drive take place on citi streets. Additionally, Waymo clock 1 billion mile on the simul last year.Th amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet' Waymo into the self-driv car project ha place it way ahead of the curv in autonom driving. Thi might eventu turn Waymo' driverless rival into potenti client if they are unabl to replic the success of it driverless tech.Waymo' rival could start use it technologyWaymo call itself a self-driv technolog company, not a car company. It current use a Lexu vehicl and a prototyp of it own to test it driverless technology, while it is also plan to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan to the fleet.Imag Source: WaymoIt is less like that Alphabet will manufactur car of it own as it seem to have chart out a differ go-to-market strategy. In January, Waymo announc that it will start manufactur sensor use in driverless car in-hous to integr it hardwar and softwar development. Thi integr should give Waymo a cost advantag and lead to stronger adopt of it driverless technology.In fact, Waymo ha reduc the cost to build a Lidar sensor -- the most crucial part of a driverless car as it use laser to gener map of the car' surround -- by 90%. The price of a Lidar sensor wa $75,000 in 2009, but it cost just $7,500 now. The integr of hardwar and softwar under a singl roof will allow Waymo to deliv seamless self-driv perform to potenti custom as it is develop it sensor in associ with machin learn experts.A automak can get turnkey self-driv solut under a singl roof, they will start turn to Waymo to power their self-driv cars.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example.In May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet' Waymo struck a deal to develop 100 self-driv car base on the Pacifica Hybrid minivan. Thi wa Waymo' first deal with an automak to suppli it driverless technology. Last month, it wa report that both compani are go to doubl down on their effort as Alphabet could add anoth 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivan to the Waymo fleet thi year.ABloombergreport say Alphabet is in talk with Fiat Chrysler to start a ride-shar servic with the minivans. If that' true, it would indic that Waymo is final take step to monet it driverless technology.Honda(NYSE: HMC) , meanwhile, could be Waymo' next partner.Both compani were in negoti last Decemb to put Waymo' technolog into Honda' vehicles. A partnership could alter Honda' approach to develop it own driverless cars. The Japanes automak initi want to get it self-driv car onto highway by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few step further by ad citi and suburban drive capabilities. A Honda press releas says:Honda previous announc it intent to put product vehicl with autom drive capabl on highway sometim around 2020 relat to it goal of a collision-fre society. In addit to these on-go efforts, thi technic collabor with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explor a differ technolog approach to bring fulli self-driv technolog to market. These discuss are an initi step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explor the potenti of a broad rang of autom drive technologies.Th takeawayTh latest California data clearli indic that Alphabet' Waymo ha a far better driverless technolog than ani of it rivals. Waymo is use thi to it advantag by partner with automak and show them the strength of it self-driv technology. Thi strategi of advertis it superior in thi space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potenti clients, make it a key player in the driverless car suppli chain.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thi trade ha a 90% theoret chanc of success. Thi sound like a great idea now, but it come with risk. By sell the put naked, I am commit to buy the stock at $130 per share if IBM fall below it.

Thi also is a bullish trade, but one with a finit risk profile. I collect 40 cent per contract to open. The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of sell the $130 nake put but for the finit risk profil advantage.Whil 40 cent may sound too little, it would repres an 8% yield on money risk and for the high chanc of success it carri it should elat most investors.I chose longer-d risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations.

The websit say AMZN' Amazon Web Servic - AW - unit ha told some of it ""larg corpor customers"" of it plan to offer a new suit of product app that will compet against the two domin players.7 REIT That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Offic ha alway been consid a cash cow for the company. The product suit quickli becam the industri standard, the applic of choic for enterprise, school and home PC users. To make it softwar seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycl between major version of Microsoft Office, and to address the grow threat of Google' free Googl App suite, five year ago, the compani began push Offic 365.Thi subscript version of Microsoft Offic brought recur monthli revenu and other advantages.

With it free Googl App and low-cost Chromebooks, Googl upend the educ market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all devic in U.S. classroom were Chromebooks. Thi ha repercuss beyond the classroom, as those student turn into young profession who are more comfort with Google' product softwar than with Microsoft Office.I'v seen the effect first hand. My kid do everyth at school use G Suite, despit Microsoft offer free Offic 365 subscript to student and comput lab full of Window PCs. They ignor Microsoft Offic and Apple' Pages/Numb on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suit for do homework.If Googl could quickli make wave in one of Microsoft' key strongholds, whi couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Whi Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThi is a key question.

Last year, Morgan Stanley predict that theIndian e-commerc marketwould grow the fastest globally, to $119 billion by 2020. And Alibaba stock is pois to benefit.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat' drive e-commerc and fintech in India? India pass the U.S. as the world' No. 2 smartphon market last year, with 220 million user . T he number of smartphon user in India is expect to balloon to 810 million by 2021 and India' 3G and 4G network could cover 300 million subscrib by March 2018.India' young and grow popul is increasingli tech-savvy, especi millennials.India' govern also support a cashless economy, see thi as a way to reduc corrupt and tax evasion. The Indian govern alsoremov the largest banknotes, 500 rupe and 1000 rupe notes, from the economy. Thi led to an explos in the use ofmobil wallet in India, ad as mani as 1 million user ad per day .Last year, the Nation Payment Corpor of India announc theUnifi Payment Interface, make it conveni for Indian to access their bank account on their phone and pay.And all these move part flow into the bull case for Alibaba stock.Tak Ant' Strategi to IndiaAlibaba and Ant (formerli Alipay) invest inOne97Communications, the parent compani of Indian e-commerc player Paytm. They are expect to increas their stake to 50% from 42%. Paytm last year spun off it payment busi to compli with regulations. One97 hold a 49% stake in Paytm Payment Bank and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma own 51%.Paytm boasted177 million usersat the end of the year and CFO Madhur Deora ha set a medium-term target of 500 million user . That growth would be a boost for Alibaba stock and Ant Financi which seeks2 billion user worldwideov the next decade.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightPaytm is clearli take a page out of Alibaba and Ant Financial' playbook. Like BABA'sMyBank- the bank ""for the littl guy"" - Paytm' bank promis to be a vehicl for financi inclusion, bring servic to India' unbanked.Lik Ant, Paytm also want to offer loan andasset manag servicesto those who can't access them now.Ant Fortune, a wealth manag app, debut in 2015. It user can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directli to businesses.Paytm' Threat to BanksBank in both countri are threaten by thi disruption. Ant' Yuebao offer depositor higher interest rate than bank andinst withdrawals. Technolog compani don't have to maintain as mani employe at branch as bank do, and can link borrow and saver directly. Their asset-light model is simpli more effici than that of exist banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burden by legaci system and regulation.Bank earn a profit on the spread, the differ between the rate at which they lend and the rate they offer depositors. Platform that connect borrow and lender and cut out the middleman can exert pressur on this. And becaus Paytm and Ant Financi are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fee than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potenti enemi to banks. It will help them drum up busi by cross-sel their servic to it users. But Paytm will probabl be the front-end in custom interact and releg the bank to the back end .Bank risk becom ""dumb pipes."" As I mention inmi articlelast year, the front-end gener give bank a higher return on equiti than the back. AMcKinsey & Companystudi found that bank earn a 22% return on equiti from sale and origination, but onli 6% from the extens of credit.Protection RisksAl of thi doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risk still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rise in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobb their Indian rivals. Indian startup such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuat repeatedli mark down over the past year. Now some are ask for protect against supposedli unfair foreign competition. Indian ventur capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capit call for such measures, follow bysimilar sentimentfrom the founder of e-commerc player Flipkart and Ola, view as India' home-grown Uber) .Sinc Paytm is an Indian company, whi would thi be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, it largest sharehold are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a compani control someth as critic as it payment infrastructure? Expert have rais concern overPaytm user dataend up in server outsid of India.Point to Paytm' Chines ties, the chief minist of West Bengal, Mamata Banerje accus the prime minist ofcompromis nation security. The Sino-Indian relationship is contentious; the two countri went to war as recent as 1962 over a border dispute.Val Pharmaceut Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectFor Paytm to work, user must see it as secur and reliable. Without trust, Paytm cannot succeed. However, in Decemb the Paytm server wa down for an hour, leav user unabl to make payments.Paytm' custom servic also is a weak spot, with mani rate it as bad. Also, the recent user increas may be temporary. After March 13, Paytm may lose as much as 30% of it offlin custom onc cash withdraw limit end.Bottom Line on Alibaba StockEven if Paytm and BABA succeed, however, buy Alibaba stock is notwithout risks.Alibaba is a variabl interest entity, which mean American sharehold own share in a Cayman Islands-bas entity. Chines law forbid foreign ownership in Chines internet compani like Alibaba, so thi structur is a way around it.But the Chines government' posit isn't clear, and it could alway chang it mind, at the expens of BABA stock holders.A of writing, Luca Hahn did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace3 Stock to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerri Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Store Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 Surprise7 REIT That Should Be CondemnedTh postAlibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Will Tri to Domin Indiaappear first onInvestorPlace."

In dollars, the differ ha drop to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compress ha come from the fact that Under Armour stock ha declin precipit after two disappoint earn reports.With the larg symbol vote right not like to chang anytim soon, there' simpli veri littl reason for UA to trade abov UAA.Accord to theregistr statementfil by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holder of Under Armour stock are entitl to the same dividends. The onli way for Class A sharehold to gain some sort of major vote power would be for Plank to be termin for caus or to give up hi shares.Neith outcom seem particularli like given that the CEO is 42 year old, intens competitive, and intent on turn around hi belov Under Armour himself.Liquid doesn't justifi the differ price for Under Armour stock, either, with one possibl exception.Ther wa a notabl diverg in equiti volum a few month ago. UA stock had an averag volum under 1 million share per day in October, roughli 20% of UAA stock. But volum over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million share a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increas in UA volum probabl ha someth to do with the narrow premium and impli that the spread will continu to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockTher is one notabl differ between UA and UAA: option volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 put is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 call open at the moment.That differ is not enough to justifi a 10% premium, however, particularli for smaller investors. And it seem the market is figur that out. But the gap remain wide enough that there' still room to make what should be close to risk-fre profit by go long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corpor (NVDA): Amaz Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAni major event - like an acquisition, as unlik as that seem at the moment - will treat sharehold equally. Ani dividend payment will be the same. The onli differ between UA and UAA is the opportun to vote even though those vote have no practic impact.So an arbitrag trade still look like it ha some upside. Vote right between class at other stock usual are below 5%, mean a long UA/short UAA trade could make anoth $1 per share with veri low risk.For investor who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice.

3 Horrendously Bad Stock Market Predictions From Otherwise Smart People,2/26/2017,"""It' tough to make predictions, especi about the future.""-- Yogi BerraEveri year, the stock market either advances, declines, or stay flat.

Here are a few classic exampl of some smart market watcher get burn by their stock calls.1. McDonald' will trounc Googl as an investmentWhitney Tilsonha use hi valu invest approach to produc awesom return for himself and hi investor over the years. Yet hi tendenc to bash ""expensive"" compani with high price-to-earn ratio ha also burn the hedg fund giant -- big time.For example, back in 2004, Tilson made abold prediction. Write for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the soon-to-be-publicAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost certainli flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odd are at least 90% that it profit margin and growth rate will be materi lower five year from now,"" he argued.Tilson got even more specific, say thatMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given it far lower valuation. ""I believ that it is virtual certain that Google' stock will be highli disappoint to investor foolish enough to particip in it overhyp offer -- you can hold me to that,"" he concluded.GOOGL Market Capdata byYCharts.So how did that predict pan out? Sinc 2005, Alphabet share are up roughli 16 times, compar to less than a 400% return for the fast food titan. The search engin giant produc nearli $20 billion of net incom last year, versu McDonald' $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six time McDonald' in the eye of the market.2. Smartphon will be a bustA deep understand of technolog isn't enough to protect you from be surpris by major shift in the industry.

They'd be ""the mother of all markets,"" accord to Apple' then-CEO, John Sculley.Grov disagreed. The idea of a commun devic that peopl carri around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by greed,"" he said. Ironically, the articl list a few predict about the technolog that prove prescient. These person commun might handl emails, use GP to map directions, and even allow someon to ""order pizza use a combin of custom electron form and wireless fax.""Today, the smartphon industri is massive, with Appl account for nearli 150 million iPhon sale in the past year. These devic help spur over $24 billion of complementari service-bas revenue, which demonstr that, if anything, investor weren't be greedi enough about the potenti for smartphon to find a huge market.3. The Dow is head to 36,000Jame Glassman' 1999 book titledDow 36,000hasn't age well. In fact, Washington Post econom columnist Neil Irwincal it""perhap the most spectacularli wrong invest book ever"" given that it forecast a massiv ralli for stock between 1999 and 2004.Glassman' time couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000 the year hi book publish befor plummet to a 15-year low of 7,000 in 2009. A roar ralli ha push the blue-chip index back to new high recently, but today it' still 42% below the mark he believ the Dow would achiev over a decad ago.^DJIdata byYCharts.To hi credit, Glassman ha taken a hard look at how hi predict could have been so far off the mark. He identifi two major factor thath and hi co-author missed: earn growth and the attitud of investor as reflect in the price-to-earn multipl they are will to pay for stocks. Neither trend went in the direct they had targeted.A better wayThes fail forecast illustr how overconfid can prove fatal to your portfolio while predict about econom trend are rare more than a distract from the busi of accumul stock market returns.Bold predict are compel becaus they attract debat and can pay big dividend if proven correct. But no one know which direct stock or market will move over the short term. That' whi investor are better off simpli buy a divers group of solid stock and hold on to the share for year (or decades) while allow the power of compound return to do all of the hard work.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

GoPro Hasn't Bought Back Any Shares in 2017. Should Investors Be Happy?,2/25/2017,"In late 2015,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) approv a $300 million buyback plan that last for 12 months. However, the action camera maker onli spent $35.6 million on buyback befor the plan expir last September.Thos purchas were poorli timed, sinc GoPro bought back about 1.5 million share at an averag price of $23.05 per share -- roughli 140% higher than it price today. GoPro made all those purchas dure the fourth quarter of 2015, and didn't buy back ani more stock until the plan expired.Imag source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();Bi do so, GoPro ha seemingli acknowledg that initi a buyback plan wa a realli bad move, and the compani doesn't seem interest in buy back ani more stock for the forese future. Should investor be happi or upset about thi strateg shift?Whi investor should be happyGoPro' prior buyback plan burn cash that should have been appli to R&D or acquisit of smaller companies, sinc the compani is gradual fall behind the tech curve.Th Hero 5 isn't much more power than the Hero 4, the Karma drone' recal practic hand the market toDJI, and GoPro still hasn't launch a stand-alon 360-degre camera to counterSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear 360,Ricoh' Theta, and other similar cameras. GoPro' softwar ecosystem also remain small, despit the introduct of new edit app and acloud backup service. Invest heavili in those area would make more sens than buy back stock.Samsung' Gear 360. Imag source: Samsung.Even if GoPro want to repurchas stock, it can no longer do so from it free cash flow. The compani gener a neg free cash flow of $151 million over the past 12 months, due to four straight quarter of loss that onli recent end with areturn to profitabilitylast quarter.Th lack of a new buyback plan also indic that CFO Brian McGee, who replac Jack Lazar last March, doesn't plan to follow in hi predecessor' footsteps. When Lazar unveil the previou buyback in 2015, some analyst saw the plan as a thinli veil attempt to offset GoPro' liber use of stock-bas compens -- which inflat it share count and dilut exist shares. That move arguabl benefit insid much more than investors.Whi investor should be upsetHowever, launch a new buyback plan thi year would give investor a sign that the stock' downsid potenti is limited. GoPro stock also isn't expensive, with an EV/Sal ratio of 0.96 and a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Sinc a PEG ratio under 1 is consid cheap, GoPro is undervalu rel to it earn growth potenti --ifit can match analysts' long-term expectations.Mani of GoPro' investor would like welcom a buyback, sinc the stock' onli near-term catalyst is the relaunch of the Karma, which could struggl to reach custom after miss the crucial holiday season.A big buyback could also flush out short seller -- who were short 33% of the company' outstand share as of Feb. 9 -- and spark a short squeeze. That ralli could inspir GoPro' insiders, who sold more share than they bought over the past 12 months, to final buy more shares. That, in turn, could inspir institut investors, who onli hold about 38% of GoPro shares, to final come back.Forget about buybacks... for nowGoPro' abandon of buyback can be consid posit or negative, but I believ that the compani should focu more on improv it core technologies.Th compani ha repeatedli claim that it ha a bright futur in virtual reality, but it multi-camera Omni and Odyssey rig were too bulki and pricey compar to cheaper action-camera size solut like the Gear 360. GoPro secur an earli 360-degre video partnership withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, but YouTub subsequentlyopen up that platformto a wide rang of other cheaper cameras.GoPro' cloud backup platform also doesn't make sense, sinc it charg a $5 monthli fee for a servic which Googl Photo provid for free on smartphones. Moreover, the platform doesn't backup video in 4K qualiti -- which like disappoint hardcor GoPro users. Lastly, GoPro must execut a smart market blitz to get the Karma back on track, especi after DJI' Mavic Pro deliv mani similar featur in a superior packag last year.Th key takeawayBuyback are often consid a strategi that matur compani use after they run out of way to significantli improv their core businesses. GoPro is in a slump, but it hasn't reach matur yet sinc it still ha plenti of way to improv it camera, drone, and softwar businesses. Therefore, I believ that investor should be happi that GoPro didn't initi a new buyback plan thi year.10 stock we like better than GoProWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It' Friday, Feb. 17, and we'r talk tech and explor Snap' IPO filing. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join on Skype byfool.comsenior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how' it going?Evan Niu:Pretti good, pretti good.Lewis:Ar you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?Niu:I recent download it just to play around with it. I'v read plenti about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it. But I start play around with it, and it' realli not intuit or easi to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of peopl on there that I follow, so I certainli don't have the full experi of regular users. But I don't realli see the appeal to it. It seem realli nich to me.Lewis:Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of friend that use it. My interest will wane depend on how often my friend are use it, and that will bring me in or out of the system. But, it seem to be super popular with millennials, and given a lot of the buzz with the compani and the fact that it is a big tech compani that' think about go public, there are a lot of investor that are interest in it.Niu:Yeah, there' been so much hype around thi thing. It doesn't seem to me like it ha a mainstream appeal, which is the exact problem thatTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) ha run into over the past few years. I see a lot more closer comparison to Twitter thanFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , which is the exact opposit storylin that Snap is go to tri to sell do it roadshow.Lewis:Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we'r go to talk about today, give you a littl overview of Snap, the Snapchat properti specifically, talk a bit about their plan to go public, and what Evan and I notic when we dug through the S-1 that recent becam available. So, we talk about, they are social media company, but they call themselv a camera company, which is interesting.Niu:I notic thi realli funni coincid -- I don't know if you would call it a coincid -- Snapchat use to consid itself a storytel company, and now it' call itself a camera company. Meanwhile,GoPr to call itself a camera compani and now is tri to call itself a storytel company. So, these two companies, they have thi weird ident thing where they want to be each other, and I don't get why, becaus it' not like GoPro is do veri well. I think it' kind of a weird thing rebrand themselv as a camera company. I mean, they have the new Spectacl glass with cameras, but I don't know. It' just a weird ident to me.Lewis:Yeah. For listen who might not be familiar with the social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as a messag platform where you are, for the most part, shoot quick, instantli delet pictur and video to you and your friends. You can also post them as stories. It ha gain a lot of popular with the millenni group. User count is still kind of low, we can talk about that a littl bit, but the compani is plan to go public, look to rais $3 billion via the public market in an issuanc that would valu the whole compani a somewher between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech IPO go, thi might be one of the biggest one for 2017.Niu:Yeah, definitely. It' definit the most exciting, the most look forward to. Peopl have been wait for thi thing for years.Lewis:Yeah, and anyth that' consumer-fac is natur go to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some folk out there who are saying, ""Wait a minute, I thought I saw an announc that thi compani plan to IPO back in the fall of 2016. Whi are we just get the S-1 and all the inform about the compani in the past coupl weeks?"" That' becaus Snap opt to go public via the confidenti IPO process. Thi process and thi approach is a byproduct of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Busi Act. Basically, under thi updat legislation, compani with under $1 billion in annual revenu can file paperwork for an IPO confidenti with the SEC. That allow the compani to go back and forth with the regulatori agenc without alert the public that they are plan on IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, onc the compani decid they do want to go forward with an issuance, the file must be made public at least three week prior to the IPO roadshow beginning, which is when the underwrit invest bank begin talk to client and build interest in a potenti issuance. Thi is all to say, while the ""confidenti IPO"" name might sound kind of shady, thi is someth that' total on the up-and-up. And that is the reason whi we onli got a look at the company' book and the S-1 earlier thi month, even though they announc intent to IPO a way back.Niu:Right. I think part of the purpos is to, like you mentioned, avoid public scrutini for the earli draft of the S-1. All compani alway have to file the S-1, but thi way they can refin it without all the public scrutiny, look at it and scrutin it. I think the idea is to encourag more compani to explor the IPO process, and if compani do end up go public, they get more capital, and it just boost the economi in term of more invest happening. I think that' the goal. But, yeah, it is a littl weird when you hear ""confidential.""Lewis:Yeah, and I think it also give compani the opportun to mayb think about go public and walk back without share all of their busi inform publicly. So, you can test the water and see if you'r ready, and you might decid you'r not, but you don't have to go through the question of your busi practices, if you think you'r go to file and you have to publicli walk back.Niu:Right, exactly.Lewis:So, that' part of it. There are some adjust in the regulatori requir for how far back a compani need to provid financi statements, as well. But really, all in all, it' a tool that allow small-grow compani to keep some of their core busi info privat and make the going-publ process a littl bit easier. And that' realli all there is to the confidenti IPO process. Given that the company' S-1 file becam public earlier thi month, I think it' fairli safe to assum we'r go to see Snap trade on the New York Stock Exchang sometim in the next coupl months. Evan?Niu:Yeah, seem like it' coming.Lewis:Consid that they are a social media company, I think it make the most sens to start look at their user base and what' go on there. That' kind of the lifeblood of busi like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is realli no different. Within their S-1, they mention, ""We assess the health of our busi by measur daili activ user becaus we believ that thi metric is the most reliabl way to understand engag on our platform."" So, it' clear that thi is what they'r hone it on as a key metric, and it' what investor are go to be watch as well.Niu:Yeah. I did find it interest that they don't disclos monthli activ users, they onli disclos daili activ users, which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I alway tend to look at sequenti growth as oppos to year-over-year growth, becaus with user base, that' the nature, there' no seasonality, it' just how much you can grow over time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap' growth is realli deceler -- it' grind to a halt, almost. And the compani tri to explain thi in saying, ""Oh, it' becaus we haven't come out with ani big new product innovation."" And, of course, that ha an impact, but you also have to worri about competition, becaus Facebook ha done a realli good job copi a lot of Snapchat' features, especi the Stori thing, which is now on Instagram. Facebook alreadi has, I think, about 150 million daili activ user use Stori now. And they launch that last year, and it' an exact replica. So, you have to wonder if that' what' take a bite out of it. And, obviously, Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources, they can innov and develop faster. It' realli Mark Zuckerberg, and Silicon Valley' -- I mean, Snapchat isn't base in Silicon Valley, but Facebook certainli is -- and Facebook tri to buy them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copi them, and they compete, and that' exactli what they'r doing. And they'r do a realli good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about competit and whether or not Snap can realli keep up.Lewis:Yeah. And Facebook famous made Snapchat an offer, I believ it wa somewher around $5 billion or so, a littl way back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, ""No, we'r go to see what we can do with thi on our own."" If they wind up go public at thi gaudi valuation, it certainli work out well for him, but you wonder if that might have stoke the competit fire in Mark Zuckerberg a littl bit.Niu:And he can also empathize, becaus he did the exact same thing withGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . [laughs] So mani peopl tri to buy Facebook, and he said, ""No, I want to do my own thing,"" and now Facebook is enorm and he is one of the richest men in the world. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah it' hard to blame him for that. To put some number on what' go on with their user growth, like you said, year-over-year, the number look realli great. They'r up 48%. But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth wa onli 3%. So, if you look at the graph that they provid in their S-1, it doe look like growth is flatten out a littl bit. Given that so much of the expect for these social platform is continu to build user base, and be abl to monet that user base realli well, you have to worri about that as an ongo risk for the business.Niu:Yeah. If they are a nich product, which, it seem that way to me, then thi could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daili user is a pretti big number. And you can build a healthi busi there if you keep your expect modest and tri to build around that base. Whereas, if you'r tri to grow, if you'r spend a ton of money tri to grow it, and you can't, which is exactli the problem that Twitter is having, then that' when it start to hurt financially. But if you just accept it for what it is and plan your busi accordingly, you can build a pretti decent busi out of it.Lewis:Yeah. For some context, I went back and look at Facebook' S-1 to see how they stack up when they went public. At the time, they had 480 million daili activ users, and they were post 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequenti growth. You hear that and think, ""Well, those growth rate are kind of similar, right?"" The differ wa scale. Even when they were do single-digit sequenti growth quarter-to-quarter, they were still ad ten of million of users, not five million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that' a huge risk, especi as you see a more entrench competitor take what' work for you and ha a lot of traction with user that you alreadi have on your platform and just appli it to thi massiv user base that they have.Niu:Right. Facebook is interest becaus they start earlier, befor the realli big rise of mobile. So a lot of their earli day were on desktop. Then, they had to navig the transit to mobile, which they have done ridicul well, far better than I think anyon ever imagined, wherea compani like Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobil from the beginning. Particularli Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.Lewis:Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of peopl want to know what' go on with the financi as well. In 2016, the compani book $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in revenu in 2015. That is humong growth, but that is on a veri tini denominator. The realiti with Snapchat is that they realli just kind of turn on the monet engin there, and have onli realli roll out ad for a veri short period of time. Right now, even, it' still a pretti ad-light experi for users.Niu:Yeah. They onli recent releas their API to autom ad sales, which is a huge import part of scale for advertis businesses, becaus it allow your advertis to do thi automatically, it' much less labor-intens to do it. So, they liter onli did thi a few month ago, and it' still in beta. So, it' veri earli day in term of their ad business.Lewis:And that' realli what' go to be make up most of the money for Snap overall, right? Advertis made up 96% of Snap' revenu in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talk about how they have the Spectacl as well, and they bill themselv as a camera company. There might be some hardwar applic somewher down the road, but in term of a scalable, high-margin business, they'r go to look to monet the Snapchat platform first, becaus if they can do it well, the opportun is the biggest there.Niu:Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those glasses...y might make a littl bit of money, but the whole point of that is to get peopl to use the platform.Lewis:Exactly, yeah. And that just feed into the idea of peopl post their stori and send stuff to friends, and make that video and pictur captur a littl bit easier. Look down at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down even more from loss of $370 million in 2015. The compani is also free cash flow neg to the tune of $670 million. No surpris there. It' a high-growth tech company, veri rare are they profit when they go public. But one thing, I don't want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that pop out to me wa gener and administr expens are $165 million, which is more than they spent in sale and marketing, and almost as much as the compani spent in R&D. And they talk about how thi is attribut to headcount increas 200% year over year, but from a corpor strategi perspective, it seem like there' sink a ton of money into G&A. I would think, if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and gain talent and push the platform in a new direction.Niu:Particularli with them talk about how import product innov is to drive user growth, you would think they would invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surpris at their cost in term of their oper expenses. I just don't know what they'r go to do next to tri to realli grow the platform more. Whi aren't they spend more money on R&D?Lewis:Yeah. And they'r go to have to. If you look at the current valuation...w talk about how they'r probabl go to end up IPO somewher in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion valuat range. That would mean that they are trade at 62X trail sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.Niu:Yeah, it' ridiculous. I rememb when Twitter and Facebook went public a few year back. They both went probabl right around 25-26X sales. And back then, I wa like, ""Wow, that' realli expensive."" [laughs] And now, 62X sales, it' unheard of. It just speak to the hype around thi company. Of course, the valuat is go to change, and we don't know what they'r actual go to price the IPO at. Right now, everyth is realli preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night befor it actual goe public. And, of course, that' all a function of how success the roadshow is. If they can realli drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't, then that' go to realli drive what the IPO price is at. But there' a possibl that thi goe higher if they have a realli good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagin them get closer to 70X sales? Who know at thi point -- it' not imposs for that to happen. It' just insan that thi compani would be abl to command such a premium.Lewis:And I think anoth layer of context here: Were it to IPO and have a valuat somewher in the mid 20s, it would basic be valu at twice Twitter' current valuation. Accord to analysts, Snapchat ha more daili activ user than Twitter, but Twitter brought in 5X as much revenu last year. So, when you think about what a realli success ad launch would look like, and build out the platform in a way that ha non-invas ad that don't realli detract too much from user experience, and you start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and build on that. And they would be do that at twice the valuat that Twitter is current at. So, you just look at the numbers, and it' realli tough to make it work, the way it' current priced.Niu:Yeah. There' no way I'm touch thi thing. [laughs]Lewis:Beyond valuat and some of the user growth issues, I know that you particularli want to hone in on some of the stuff with vote right with the share they'll actual be issuing.Niu:Yeah, I think it' realli interesting. The share that they'r issu to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero. A lot of tech compani have been do thi thing for a long time where they give the public share one vote, and the insid get these supervot share with 10 vote or more. That allow the compani founder and insid to maintain control no matter what. Googl is probabl the biggest and earliest exampl of this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the execut and director of Google, they collect control about 60% of the vote power. So, public investor realli have no say. If they disagre with something, they have no recourse. Facebook is, of course, anoth good example, with Zuckerberg himself person control about 60% of the vote power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just doe whatev he wants. So, the question is, is it realli a big deal? Investor are now use to thi idea that they don't get a say and how these compani are run. The differ with Snap is that they'r basic be upfront and be like, ""You don't even get to pretend like you have a say.""Certainly, it' all bad from a corpor govern perspect on principle, becaus obviously, it' better for sharehold to have a say. But at the same time, you can see that it' work quit well for compani like Googl and Facebook. Imagin if Googl sharehold had a vote in tell Googl not to do all thi random side stuff that they explore, you could argu that the compani wouldn't be as success as it has. There is a case to be made that thi is a good thing, in some situations. But we don't know how it' go to play out for Snap.Lewis:Yeah. I think one of the reason whi I have a bone to pick with it is, you have the two compani co-founders, Evan Spiegel, the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owner of the supervot Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Ani Class Bs or Cs that are sold are transfer automat convert to the Class As, the non-vot shares. Anyth that would happen with them, they have a supermajority, and anyth that might happen would continu to concentr that power. So, you look at these tech compani later on issu non-vot shares, or with Facebook, decid that they want to split it stock and issu C share so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain hi control of the compani and be abl to give away the non-vot share through hi charit efforts. Mark Zuckerberg ha demonstr that he ha the right combin of that tech-forward think and the busi savvi in order to run one of the world' biggest compani and do it incred successfully. Spiegel and Murphi don't have that track record.Niu:Right. Zuckerberg ha definit earn some respect. He' realli demonstr that he can execut on these bigger-pictur strategi and grow Facebook in the way that he has. The stock split thing is funni because, like you were saying, he vote it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actual occur yet even though it' been approved, becaus he said it would happen. But, yeah, you realli need to trust these founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course, Zuckerberg wa too, a few year back. But, to your point, he just doesn't have a track record. And it' like, what ha he done beyond creat Snapchat? You can't realli point to ani singl great busi move and be like, ""That wa a realli smart strategy, that wa a realli good move."" You know? You have to have a lot of faith.Lewis:On of the other thing I'm see a lot of peopl talk about, dig through the S-1 and do their homework on the company, is the company' cloud strategy.Niu:Yeah, thi is realli an interest topic for me becaus Snapchat is do someth that' realli unpreced in term of how they'r approach their cloud infrastructure. Most of the time, when compani are launch these app and onlin servic and consumer-bas products, eventually, when they get to a certain point, they start invest in their own infrastructure, either by build their own data center and server in co-loc facil that they share with other companies, or build their own. Facebook is build it seventh data center, and it' fulli owned. Twitter co-loc it data centers. Snap is not do ani of that. Snap is reli 100% on third-parti cloud infrastructur providers, Googl Cloud andAmazonAWS. It' just crazi becaus the scale at which they'r operating, it would normal make sens to start invest in it yourself, but Snap is content to basic continu to do thi through third parties. It' not clear if thi is go to work, becaus no one ha ever tri thi before, so it' thi huge experiment, and there are a lot of risk becaus you don't get to control your infrastructur in your back end, which is incred import to your business, and you'r also spend a ton of money. Obviously, build the infrastructur yourself cost a ridicul amount of money. But over time, it will eventu pay for itself.So, what Snap is do is that they commit to spend $3 billion total over the next five year between Googl and Amazon combined. Googl is the primari provider, and Amazon is basic a backup. They'r spend $400 million a year on Google. The spend commit with Amazon ramp up, it start at like $50 million and then it' $350 million by the end. But that' a huge spend commitment. Thi is, veri specifically, their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost revenu is predominantli compos of these infrastructur costs, and cost revenu is greater than revenue. So, they have a neg gross margin right now becaus of thi strategi veri specifically. At the same time, becaus of these long-term commitments, the pressur is now on for the ad business. You have to grow ad sale to these level just to keep up with it, just to break even on gross profit, befor you even start talk about oper expenses.Th pressur to grow the ad busi is incred high, and they have almost no experi do that. So, it' a huge risk not onli operationally, but it' also a huge risk financially. If you are unabl to grow your ad busi enough to cover these costs, you'r just go to be hemorrhag cash. And it doesn't matter how popular the servic is, if you'r just blow through money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it' not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be abl to do it or not, but the point is, the risk that' there is insane. They have to realli turn up these ad sale just to cover their spend commitments.Lewis:Yeah, beyond all of the gener investor interest in Snap that will undoubtedli be there for the next coupl year and beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insid watch thi decision. If it works, mayb they'll use it as a blueprint, and decid that it allow the compani to be more nimble. But, you have to wonder about the company' abil to control costs, and have total control over what' go on with the IT infrastructure, becaus that' how everyon is interact with their product.Niu:Yeah. Everyon in the cloud infrastructur market is watch veri closely, becaus they'r like, ""Thi is crazy, how much thi compani is spending."" It' great news for the cloud infrastructur market, of course, becaus it' one of the biggest custom out there. They'r bring in a lot of money, and everyon is go to see if thi can realli work. I mean, it' worth note that Snap is hedg itself say it might eventu -- in the S-1, it say they may choos to invest in it infrastructur at some point. A few month ago, they actual poach Amazon' head of data center for AWS. So, it' like, there are some hint that they'r explor the idea of do their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it probabl wouldn't be for the next five year becaus of these commitments. So, yeah, they'r still leav themselv an out. But it seem realli risky. It might work out great. In the event that thing go down -- let' say the servic just crash -- that doe let them ramp down variabl cost with more flexibility, as oppos to, if you spend all thi money to build all thi infrastructur and the servic die for whatev reason, theoretically, then you would be stuck with all thi infrastructur you paid all thi money for. Versus, just pay it as a variabl expens base on usage. So, it' go to be someth that' go to be veri interest to see play out, not just becaus of Snap, but also becaus of the implic for the bigger compani that are provid these servic like Amazon and Google, alsoMicrosoft. Microsoft would certainli like to get a piec of that spending. But yeah, I think that ha a lot of implic for the broader infrastructur market.Lewis:To bring it back around to the stock itself and how we'r look at it, it seem like you and I are in the same camp here -- we have some concern over user growth, the valuat as it' current be reported, we'll see what happen after they run through the roadshow, but the valuat is a littl too rich for us to realli even look at too much, also we have a lot of question about the competit risk with some Facebook and Instagram loom out there, and possibl be abl to just grab featur and drop it on their instal base. Doe that wrap how we feel about Snap? Anyth els you want to add in there, Evan?Niu:I don't think Snap' investable, honestly. There are so mani risks, the financi don't make sense, the valuat doesn't make sense, you get no voting. [laughs] I don't doubt that share will pop from the offer just becaus of the hype, but as we'v seen with mani overhyp IPO in recent years, it onli take a few month for the market to sober up. Plus, Snap' also do a differ thing with the lock-up period. Employe will be abl to sell sooner -- the lock-up expir for employe sooner than is typical. Normally, it' about 180 days. They'r go to allow their employe to sell at 150 days, along with all the co-founders. So, there could be some sell pressur as all these investor and employe cash out. The employe and all the insid are go to make a ton of money, but as far as public investor go, I don't know. It' also worth mention that their stock-bas compens expens so far are quit small becaus they'r still private. I think last year it wa someth like $30-some million, which is a tini proport of their expenses. But when compani go public, the liquid event trigger a ridicul increas in stock-bas compens cost becaus now that stock is worth so much more. And that' typic for all compani that go public -- right after they go public, they have a huge increas in stock-bas comp. That' someth to be awar that is coming. Plus, they'r probabl go to start unload pretti quickly. I don't know, I just don't see, after the initi honeymoon, how thi thing can realli go even further, after it' alreadi at such a ridicul level. You know what I mean?Lewis:I am absolut with you. Listeners, you can be sure that as detail start to crystal and we get a better sens of what' happen with the Snap IPO, we'll be sure to do an updat on thi episod as market condit clear up a littl bit. But, for now, I think that doe it. Evan?Niu:Yeah, I think we hit it.Lewis:Listeners, that doe it for thi episod ofIndustri Focus.

But unless you are a mega-wealthi investor or manag a financi institution, you'll like not get ani share in the offering. Rather, you'll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuat will probabl be much higher.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo is it ani wonder that IPO can be a raw deal?That may be true, but when it come to invest in the big-growth opportunities, there realli is no need to specul in the IPO market. Hey, there are a varieti of interest stock current on the market that should be good enough.Tak a Look at GOOGL StockOn to consid is actuallyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Granted, the compani is fairli mature, have been found in 1998.But what' import about GOOGL stock is that the compani ha global brand, scale, infrastructur and massiv user base to play in critic growth markets. Such factor are must-hav for get the attent of sponsors, especi those that have massiv budgets.Th 10 Best Stock Chart on Wall Street Right NowThi is whi a compani likeTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) ha struggl so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company' revenu increas by a mere0.9% on a year-over-year basisto $717.2 million, mark the 10th consecut quarter of top-lin deceleration. U.S. revenu fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the compani ha yet to gener a profit on a GAAP basis.Al thi happen even though there were major catalyst from the presidenti election, NFL stream and the holiday season.Bi comparison, in thelatest quarterAlphabet report an impress 22% jump in revenu to $26.1 billion and GAAP earn of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.But thi shouldn't be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is posit nice for major growth categori like video (YouTube), mobil (Android, Googl Play and Waze), devic (Pixel and Googl Home) and cloud computing. All these repres multi-billion-dollar market opportun - and should all provid nice long-term driver for GOOGL stock.Just look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchas for $1.3 billion back in Octob 2013. Interestingli enough, thi price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plan to launch a ride-hail service- similar toUber's- in variou citi in the U.S. that is base on the Waze platform.Bi the way, back in 2013, the compani also invest $258 million in Uber.Although, when it come to GOOGL stock, the real play is like to be the impact from the company' major invest in deep learn and AI (artifici intelligence). Let' face it, Alphabet ha a big-tim advantag becaus of it experi in handl massiv amount of inform with search.Alreadi GOOGL is introduc great AI products, such as it Assist offer (the app allow for sophist natur languag conversations). But the compani ha also includ more than 350 AI featur across mani of the company' other product dure 2016.Accord to Alphabet Inc CEOSundar Pichai: ""A I'v share before, comput is move from a mobile-first to AI-first with more univers ambient and intellig comput that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are make with machin learning.""Mor importantly, GOOGL stock is current trade at an attract valuation. Consid that the forward price-to-earn ratio is roughli 22X. Although, if you strip out the $86 billion in the bank, the multipl is 19. And thi is roughli in line with Wall Street' 19% five-year forecast growth rate.OK, then what about Snap? True, growth is ramp at a rapid pace. But then again, the compani ha onli recent begun to monet it user base, so it doe not take much to gener huge spikes.Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) Stock Look Great After Q4 EarningsYet it appear that - base on estim fromGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - Snap will churn out roughly$2 billion in revenu in 2018. But thi will still mean that the compani will trade at over 10 time revenu on atwo-year forward basis. As for GOOGL stock, it is current at a price-to-sal multipl of 6.4X.So again, if you don't get share of Snap (and you probabl won't - at least the at the offer price), then it' no big deal.

The worst-cas scenario may alreadi be price into QCOM stock, which mean the recent weak make for a compel entri point.Th BadTh legal wrangl is mostli withAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Appl be success with it effort, it open the door to other litigation, not to mention embolden a similar case be brought against Qualcomm by the Feder Trade Commission.Th short version of the story: Appl (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all argu the same thing - Qualcomm' busi model of licens it technolog to phonemak isnot onli exorbitant, but unlaw stifl competition. That' a legal no-no in most ani country. The Korea Fair Trade Commiss isseek $873 million for essenti the same.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM ha lost thi argument before. In 2015, thecompani fork over $975 million to Chinafor break that country' antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedli charg all-encompass licens feesto phonemak that may or may not have need access to all of the technolog in that IP package… anoth dubiou practice.Year of sharp deal have final caught up with Qualcomm.Th GoodTh ironi is, while the compani wa over-milk it age patent portfolio, QCOM wa also develop some new - and highli market - intellectu property.Th idea of the Internet of Thing (IoT) is an excit one, but the realiti is, the technolog and bandwidth need to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. Thi week, Qualcommunveil it 802.11ax technology, which can carri four time the amount of data current Wi-Fi technolog carries, but without use ani more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technolog VP Rahul Patel explained:It is take Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experi point of view. What it is tri to do is prepar the Wi-Fi network, which in mani case is experienc a lot of congestion, larg becaus the network is becom dens and is not abl to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the compani ha creat a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connect between a mobil phone' modem and the transceiver. Not onli is it a superior solut to current alternatives, it' a simpler solut that work with a varieti of connect protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the util of modem intelligence.They'r not the kind of advanc the averag consum care about, or even understands.

One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm' busi model of leverag an age patent portfolio - and do so in a question manner - is go to falter. If the compani want to continu be an IP player, it' go to need some new IP.Th question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platform be enough? It matters, simpli becauseth company' licens and royalti revenu is roughli twice it revenu from outright chip sales.3 Stock That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeTh answer to thi question is a qualifi yes; the qualif is the speed with which lawsuit will result in a decision, and the time that will be need for IoT and 5G to reach critic mass. Odd are good the former will hurt befor the latter helps, mean Qualcomm could be head for a dri spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-term who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreci the potenti of the distant futur now…aft a few year of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropri for grandma' retir portfolio, but there' littl doubt the company' new technolog will be crucial to the next gener of connectivity.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

Will Your Next New Car Help Build Maps for Self-Driving?,2/23/2017,"Mobiley N.V.(NYSE: MBLY) , an Isra compani that special in advanc driver-safeti systems, ha begun roll out a new offer that will help the self-driv car of the near futur function in more area -- and your next new car might be enlist to help.Th new offering, call Road Experi Management, or ""REM,"" is a system that will creat highli detail map that self-driv car can use to back up (or double-check) the input from their sensors. It will use data collect by camera on mani new cars, start with the 2018 model year.Thi is a big deal, not just for Mobiley but also for it custom -- which includ nearli all of the world' automak -- and peopl who are hope to have access to self-driv car in the near future.makeArticleAd();Mobileye' chief technolog officer, Amnon Shashua, outlin the company' approach to self-driv in a present last month. Imag source: Mobiley N.V.The problem: Self-driv car need special mapsWhen the first fulli self-driv car arriv on the market in a few years, their capabl will be limited. In most cases, the car will be ""geofenced,"" restrict to drive in particular areas. (In the wide use industri nomenclature, these are call ""Level 4"" systems. ""Level 5"" system that are self-driv with no restrict are probabl still mani year away.)Th car will be geofenc becaus most of the self-driv system under develop requir special high-definit map to work safely. The map help the car' ""brain"" figur out exactli where it is rel to thing like curb and road barriers, provid a layer of redund beyond the car' sensors. (That may sound, well, redundant. But it' critic to ensur that self-driv system meet the requir standard of safety.)Obviously, the compani that can access the best and most extens map will have a competit advantage. Car equip with their system will be abl to drive themselv to more places. That mean that the race is on not onli to creat map cover the widest possibl areas, but to creat way to ensur that the map are alway up to date.Mobiley ha a direct stake in thi race. It' gear up to bring aLevel 4 system to market by the end of 2019, in partnership withDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) . That system will be market to automakers, who will probabl be abl to have it in showroom (or in servic with ride-hail companies) by about 2021.Thi self-driv test vehicl incorpor a prototyp of the system be develop by Delphi, Mobileye, and Intel. Imag source: Delphi Automot PLC.The partner will almost certainli have competit from compani likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit,Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F)Argo AI subsidiary-- and like others.Mobileye' Road Experi Manag initi is intend to make sure that it Level 4 offer is as complete, and as compelling, as possible. And your next new car might help.How Mobiley will build -- and profit from -- the mapsTh idea behind REM is that Mobiley can use the camera on exist car as a low-cost way to harvest the data need to make the maps, as well as other inform that will be use to self-driv cars. Mani new car have front-fac camera that are use for adapt cruis control, lane-departur warnings, and other advanc driver-assist system (or ""ADAS"") -- and mani of those camera-bas system were sold to the automak by Mobileye.In recent months, Mobiley ha been reach out to it automak clients, invit them to join the REM effort by allow data from their vehicl to be collected. In exchange, Mobiley is offer a share of the revenu it expect to gener from sell that data to mapmak companies.So far,Volkswagen AGandBMW AGhav sign up to allow REM to gather data from their vehicles, start in the 2018 model year. Duringthi past week' earn call, Mobileye' CTO Amnon Shashua said that hi compani expect to announc a third deal within a few weeks, and to have the major of it automak partner sign up by the end of 2017. (These deal includ extens privaci safeguards; the data won't be link to specif car owners.)Shashua explain how revenu will be gener from the REM effort:W believ revenu will be gener from two separ product [of REM]. One is the map, which is a critic input to autonom vehicl systems. The other is a broad set of real-tim dynam inform such as traffic density, weather condit and open park spots. We expect the primari custom for each of these product to be mapmakers, and we recent announc engag with both [high-definit map company] HERE and the Japanes map compani Zenrin.Th upshot: An import step as the self-driv race shape upAssum that a major of the world' major automak do in fact join the REM program, Mobileye' effort stand to put it ventur with Delphi and Intel in a strong competit posit as the market for self-driv system take shape.I'v argu that the idea of a ""race"" to self-driv technologyisn't a use way for investor to think. Level 4 system will be avail to all automak within four or five years; there won't be much advantag to the compani that come to market first. We won't be abl to think in term of ""winners"" until the detail of the differ offer becom clear.That process is starting. REM make it like that the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel offer will have access to map that allow it to oper in mani area of the world, right from the start. For investors, that make the success of the partners' system more likely, and an invest in Mobiley -- the purest play of the three -- a littl more compelling.10 stock we like better than MobileyeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure Thing,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsImmedi after the U.S. elections, the consensu wa to buy the small cap and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stock likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell, but eventu recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-tim high. Then came earn season.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh reaction to GOOGL earn wa brutal - share fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bull step in and defend the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc ha all but eras the entir post-earn dip.I'v alway said that the short-term reaction to earn is pure a gamble. And that the longer-term fundament will eventu prevail.Mi interpret of Alphabet earn is that the Googl machin is still on rails! It print money from multipl asset that have more than a billion users; manag is a proven winner; and spend on crazi ventur ha abated. Alphabet now even have offici structur to profit from the self-driv auto arena.3 Cover Call to Squeez Dividend Out of Thin AirSo, for the long term, I have no real worri for GOOGL stock other than the gener equiti market gyrations. If market sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect share to fall too far on their own from the company' own actions.GOOGL Option PlayOpt are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trade with ampl buffer that I expect to be sure winner given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defend by fundament investors. Then I sell risk against those level and sit back and let time work for me.You'v read the statist that most option expir worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of option sinc the buyer lose most often.Th Bet:Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. Thi is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price give thi trade a 95% theoret chanc of success. Sell nake put is dangerous. Not everyon is comfort expos themselv to such downsid risk. If GOOGL stock fall below my sold put, I am commit to own the stock at that level. So anyth below $647 per share would accru loss if GOOGL fall 30% or so.Sinc risk toler vary, I will offer an altern trade with similar metric but with a finit risk profile. The altern version would better fit smaller accounts, too.Th Alternate:Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoret chanc of success is still more than 90%. If successful, thi trade yield 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay abov my sold spread to win.Usually, I like to balanc my trade by sell opposit risk. In thi case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entri a littl in thi ""anim spirited"" equiti market.Th Hedg (Optional):Sel the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. Thi is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread avail yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. Thi trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potenti yield would almost doubl becaus I can onli lose on one side or the other. In thi case, the two side will balance, but not perfectly. I am not requir to hold these option trade through expiration.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsChoos between buyingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choic between valu and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the valu play, while GOOGL stock provid the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil Appl share have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earn ratio around 16, lower than what investor are pay for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cent per share, more than cover by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenu increas to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. Thi justifi a P/E of nearli 30. The share are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investor prefer valu over growth and Appl stock is do better than Alphabet. But thi isn't the proverbi choic between a rock and a hard place, instead, it' more like pick between cooki and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have own them for sever years, and I have profit handsom hold both.Th Case for AAPL StockNo technolog compani is as adept at squeez profit from hardwar as Apple.Whil other smartphon compani struggl to make money, Appl regularli bring $1 of everi $4 in iPhon sale to it bottom line. It close ecosystem is perceiv as safe and their product last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowTh current case for Appl stock, however, ha littl to do with hardware. Instead,servic now driveth stock forward. Servic like it app store - from which it take a 30% cut of sale - Appl Music, iPay and iCloud have becom huge, with $7.17 billion of revenu in the fourth quarter alone. The success of it servic enabl Appl to becom a power in the cloud by put more than$12 billioninto capit spend last year. It' no secret that the cloud is a capital-intens business, but Appl ha been abl to out-spend cloud rival without disturb it profit machine.AAPL hadov $246 billion in cashon it book at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administr ha propos a one-tim tax cut to encourag Appl to bring thi cash back to the U.S. That' enough money to buy compani such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analyst subtract the Appl cash from it market cap, they find the compani itself valu at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two time sales. If you'r look for a cheap valu stock, pois for an era of unpreced growth, with plenti of safeti and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.Th Case for GOOGL StockTh artist formerli known as Googl have a differ case to make.Alphabet ha becom acash flow monster, deliv nearli $40 billion in oper cash flow last year. It revenu grew nearli 20%, and GOOGL' oper margin is over 25%.Cloud scale like no invent ever seen before, and Alphabet deliv a global search servic for liter nothing. It Android oper system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watch as custom who own them come to it services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL ha also becom a power in hardware. It Chromebook now outsel Apple' Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now particip in all the hardwar market pioneer by rival - from virtual realiti headset to stream devic - with watch and person assist that let you conduct search of your home or the world with just your voice.Und CFO Ruth Porat, who join the compani fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is final tell investor how much they'r spend on ""other bets"" like robot and self-driv cars, and it' work to make money on those ventures.Th Bottom LineIt' hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Noth More Than Feelings.Th perceiv threat to Alphabet is the grow balkan of the Internet, with nation govern seek to control what peopl see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That ha yet to impact GOOGL, but even the percept can hurt a stock.AAPL is current benefit from a global flight to safety. It enorm cash position, it strength as a luxuri brand, and it growth in services, which could easili be expand into competit in the cloud with compani such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If push to the wall and forc to buy just one right now, I would probabl go with GOOG, the non-vot version of Alphabet stock, which share equal in earn but sell at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both compani are likeGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) wa in the 1950s,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) wa in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) wa in the last decade.

Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) In a Dividend Aristocrat Bubble?,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn May 23, 1719, one of the greatest financi bubbl in the histori of the world kick off when the Compagni Perpetuel de Ind wa grant a monopoli by the French monarchi over all the trade right of all French coloni worldwide.makeArticleAd();Th company' stock price quickli soared, from 300 livr per share to more than 1,000 just a few month later. It wa quit a jump. But the enthusiasm continu for more than 18-months.In fact there wa such a frenzi to buy share that it wasn't uncommon for the stock price to doubl in a singl day. By November, share price had surpass 10,000.Base on modern-day calculations, a share price of 10,000 livr would have valu the compani at more than the entir GDP of Franc at the time.That would be likeAlphabet Inc(GOOGL) orAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) have a $20 TRILLION stock market capit today. Insane.A with all bubbl throughout history, that one burst as well… quickli and violently. Call it 'revers to the mean'. Stein' Law. Or just plain old common sense.It' pretti simple- there are certain anomali that are too absurd to last. And natur alway find a way to correct them.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveWhil it' nowher near as extrem as the Compagni Perpetuel de Indes, the market today is also in a complet unsustain position.I'l show you what I mean-Tak a look atExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM); it' one of the largest compani in the world and a favorit among investor due to it 3.7% dividend yield.Quart after quarter, Exxon Mobil ha been pay dividend to it sharehold without fail for decades, even at the peak of the financi crisis.Not onli that, but the compani ha gener increas it dividend each year as well. To stock investors, that kind of consist is a gold mine. But there' a small problem.For the last sever years, Exxon ha been borrow money in order to maintain it dividend payments. Last month, for example, the compani report $26.4 billion in cashflow from it busi oper dure 2016.But in order to maintain the business, the compani had to spend $16.7 billion on what' known in financ as ""capit expenditures"" or ""capex"". Capex is critic to a big busi like Exxon Mobil; everi year they have to replac old machinery, purchas more land, etc.If they don't do these things, the busi will suffer and revenu will decline. So after subtract the capex, Exxon Mobil had $9.7 billion remain in ""free cash flow"".Not bad.Except that, accord to the company,they paid $12.5 billion in dividends.Hang on a sec. How is it possibl that the compani could pay $12.5 billion in dividend when they onli had $9.7 billion in free cash flow remain after the capex spending?Easy. They went into debt. Exxon borrow billion of dollar in order to pay it sharehold a healthi dividend. And they'v been do thi for years. Exxon Mobil is FAR from alone.Verizon Commun Inc.(VZ) is anoth shine example: in 2016, the compani earn $22.7 billion from it busi operations, but had $17.1 billion worth of capex. That left $5.6 billion remaining. Yet Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividends.Onc again, the compani took on billion of dollar in addit debt.Thi ha been a major trend across the biggest compani in the market.There' noth wrong with debt; sometim it can be a smart move that creat valu for the company.Our manufactur busi in Australia recent took on some debt to buy some new equipment, for example. It' been a great decision; we'r abl to gener more revenu with less cost, so the overal growth in our profit is multipl greater than the interest payment.But borrow billion of dollar just to pay out what amount to sham dividend is a complet wast of money… and irresponsible.It also mean that these record high stock price are artificial, base on debt-fuel dividend and share buyback instead of healthi free cash flow.Thi is total unsustainable.In addition, with an averag P/E ratio of 26.5, stock valuat are at their highest level sinc the financi crisis; it' yet anoth layer of risk in thi market.10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy TodayFew peopl ever got rich buy what wa popular and expensive.

If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet repres their core market message.But what happen when you own the internet? That' a theoret question to everyon except GOOGL.A I mention in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engin is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whop 300%. It just get wors as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it' just not even worth considering. In ani other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an invest in life itself. Mani peopl thought that thenam changeto Alphabet - a play on the financi term ""alpha"" and the gambl term ""bet"" - wa cheeki and a bit ridiculous. But it also signifi that Alphabet Inc could do whatev it want becaus no one can stop it. GOOGL stock wa essenti either an asset or a threat, depend on your perspective.Volatil Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matter most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't alway shown it best stuff. True, it' earli into 2017, and so far, it' up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up everi month and you'r guarante a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc ha also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlac contributor Chri Tyler point out. For example, GOOGL wa look at close Januari at over 6%. Instead, it onli secur 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowOn a strictli nomin basis, that' not much of a swing. But on percentag basis, it' a much differ story. It ha been well over a decad sinc Alphabet stock introduc itself to the markets. The crazi dynam involv in a fresh tech compani should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and it subsidiari are compar toGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) if GE wa a littl more hip.But with great size come great envy. Alphabet Inc now face a fundament problem.Oracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) want to reengag acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issu is the company' gener use of Oracle' Java softwar in order to design the Android oper system. GOOGL contend that use Java - which is open-sourc - is fair game. Oracl contend that it violat the ""fair use "" compon of copyright law.For those that acquir GOOGL stock, it' an ugli situat that might be a legitim risk. Here' the thing - whether it' legitim or not doesn't matter. If the market think it' a problem, it' a problem. That make the sight of what appear to be a bearish head-and-should pattern (between earli Decemb until now) a curiou development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it' not the best idea to buy an invest with baggage. Certainly, it' not a good idea when the baggag is from a giant compani like Oracle. Ditto that for it 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someon you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock ha some challenges.3 Struggl Stock That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it' a coincid that the head-and-should pattern is emerg right now. If I'm look at Alphabet Inc pure as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at thi juncture. I expect share to at least test it 50-day move average, which stand just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide toward it 200-day move average, which is around $763.Again, that' look at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technic as it is fundamentally. Asid from some bump in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoy clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bump have never affect Alphabet Inc in a perman way.Th bottom line here is that I would be content hold GOOGL stock. Further, ani dip are justifi buy opportunities, not mere contrarian for it own sake. Alphabet Inc isgo to $1,000- just tri to ignor the turbul as best you can.A of thi writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Consum Stock That Will Knock Your Sock Off7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeTh postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappear first onInvestorPlace."

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?,2/23/2017,"I bought a use car recently, and a few day after I brought it home, a friend ask me, ""Do you think thi is the last car you'll ever buy?""W talk a lot about self-driv cars, so I knew exactli where he wa go with hi question. He wa hint at the fact that both autonom car technolog and ride-shar servic are advanc so quickli that by the time I'd be in the market for anoth vehicle, I might not actual need to buy one.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Bi 2035, the IH estim there will be 76 million car on the road worldwid with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonom car that can keep themselv in their lanes, automat brake in emerg situations, and slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as littl as $20,000.And as genuin driverless car get cheaper and becom ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthli car payment and opt-in to a monthli mileag subscript servic instead.Automak are invest in thi futureTo understand how it' possibl that we could soon live in a world where most peopl don't own cars, we need to look no further than what the automak themselv are doing.Elon Musk' recent updat version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) master plan includ detail on a new service: When the company' vehicl becom fulli autonom (bi 2018 or 2019, accord to Musk), Tesla owner will be abl to allow their vehicl to drive themselv around and be rent out by other people.A Musk wrote:Y will also be abl to add your car to the Tesla share fleet just by tap a button on the Tesla phone app and have it gener incom for you while you'r at work or on vacation, significantli offset and at time potenti exceed the monthli loan or leas cost.Imag source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy it own fleet of driverless vehicl for rent in area where there wa more demand for Tesla vehicl than privat own car could meet, so that ""you can alway hail a ride from us no matter where you are."" Remember, thi isn't the catchphras of a taxi company, nor even a ride-hail servic -- but rather the direct where Musk see hi automak headed.And just in case think thi mental is uniqu to the innov Tesla, consid whatGener Motors(NYSE: GM) is doing. The giant automak launch a ride-shar servic last year call Maven, which allow some GM owner to rent out their vehicl when they'r not in use. The car don't drive themselv yet, but the compani see it as a first step toward a futur where peopl are less inclin to own cars.In a press releas at the time, GM said that more than 25 million of it custom around the world will use some form of share mobil by 2020, and describ Maven as ""a key element of our strategi to chang ownership model in the automot industry."" Maven ha spread to 17 citi across North America in just 11 months, ha 22,000 members, and ha been use for 57 million mile of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) ha launch i ts own ride-shar service, and is develop autonom car just like GM. Ford ha made it clear that it intend to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car pair with ride-hail and ride-shar servic by 2021. The compani is alreadi test 30 self-driv Fusion Hybrid in sever states, and plan to tripl the number of test vehicl thi year.Oth automak are move in thi direct as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is work withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl to test a fleet of 100 self-driv minivan that will be the basi for aride-hail serviceset to launch later thi year. It' still unclear what the servic will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critic role in it, but what is clear is that the automak believ in the viabil of Waymo' cars-as-a-servic goal.Wil thi realli end car ownership?It' hard to answer thi question conclusively, of course. After all, most peopl haven't even seen a fulli autonom vehicl on the road, let alon ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-found and presid of ride-hail compani Lyft,believ thatbi 2025 ""privat car ownership will all-but end in major U.S. cities."" Lyft expect the major of it vehicl to be self-driv by 2021, and rival Uber is test similar strategi as well.Oth have set similar timelin for the demis of car ownership. Georg Bauer, who ha held execut posit at Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusi Insiderlast year that he think car ownership could be dead within five to 10 years.Govern regul and our own apprehens about give up control over our vehicl may preserv the widespread car ownership cultur for longer than some expect. But what' crystal clear is that tech compani and automak alik are bet on an automot futur that look veri differ than today. Like mani things, the transit from own car to rent driverless one on an as-need basi will like occur in stage -- but let' be clear, thing are certainli move in thi direction. And I, for one, would welcom a world without car payments.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Mobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …",2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI'v long thoughtMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY) is too expensive. Mobiley ha an interest opportun in driver assistance, and eventually, autonom driving. But it also ha intens competit from compani rang fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Tier 1 supplier likeDelphi Automot PLC(NYSE:DLPH) andAutoliv Inc.(NYSE:ALV). But I haven't short MBLi stock - yet - and I hardli thought Mobileye' fourth-quart earn on Wednesday present an opportunity.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Embassi Tel Aviv via FlickrAft all, MBLi is a stori stock, and the stori look strong head into Mobiley earnings. A seri of deal and partnership announc in the past few week led MBLi stock up 35% from late Decemb lows. Optim around autonom drive and increas automot technolog continu to rise; there' a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-tim highs. Bet against that in the short-term seem foolish.That stori appear to hold for a littl while longer, as Mobiley earn out Wednesday morn came in ahead of consensu estim and the company' own guidance. In response, MBLi stock revers from modest gain to modest loss back to 2%-plu gain again in premarket trading. That seem to impli that investor alreadi are look forward.But it' there the Mobiley stori might have some holes.Mobiley Earn Look SolidMobiley earn for Q4 beat both Street consensu and it own guidanc on the top and bottom line. Revenu of $104.6 million, in particular, look impressive. MBLi had guid for roughli $96 million come out of Q3 in move expect to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Head into the earn report, analyst larg back those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowTh beat, then, impli growth roughli 11 point higher than thought, with revenu grow almost 46% year-over-year.Th driver (no pun intended) appear to be aftermarket sales. Those sale - larg dash-mount system on exist cars, rather than instal system in new car - increas 156% year-over-year. MBLi manag had rais full-year project for that divis after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobiley earn show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sale increas 113% for full-year 2016.Earn per share beat consensu and impli guidanc by 2 cents, which impli that profit margin were roughli as expected. The reason like is that aftermarket sale offer lower gross margins, and thu aren't quit as profitable. MBLi ha improv gross margin in the business, but mix seem like the most signific reason whi the compani didn't better leverag sale growth.Long-Term Question Remain for MBLi StockTh fact that the revenu beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quit the outcom that Mobiley stock bull would have prefer for Q4.The excit busi here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportun and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sale is noth to sneez at, it' still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sale for 2016, on it own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterpris valu over $10 billion.That seem to mean investor are look forward. 2017 guidanc on the confer call is for EP of $1.01-$1.05 and revenu of $490 million-$505 million. Earn appear just shi of analyst estim of $1.04, while revenu of $490 million-$505 million suggest an outperform to Street expect of $491 million.That combination, however, mean margin will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, like come from a higher-than-expect proport of aftermarket revenu - again, not what the bull necessarili want to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concern to enter the narr in MBLi stock in post-earn trading.Look ForwardMorgan Stanley downgrad Mobiley stock at the begin of the month base on margin concern - a move that took MBLi stock down 3%. And the abil of Mobiley to maintain margin is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptic that ani semiconductor compani can hold price (and thu margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobiley stock, now trade at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is price higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia' huge gain over the past year have come from optim over prospect for it Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turn to after it relationship end with Mobiley (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decis alon illustr the long-term challenges. Competit will be intense, and price will be too. It' import to rememb that MBLi is a semiconductor compani (though it ha softwar capabilities, admittedly) and an automot supplier. Neither industri tradit get veri high earn multiple, becaus both busi are extrem tough.For Mobiley to be an outlier on both fronts, it execut need to be perfect, and it growth flawless. Mobiley earn for Q4 show a step in the right direct from that standpoint.But with the earn beat driven larg by aftermarket sales, that step probabl isn't big enough for MBLi stock to take anoth step higher.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani Minute9 Top Pharmaceut Stock to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveTh postMobiley NV Q4 Earn Are Good Enough for Now, But …appear first onInvestorPlace."
Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?,2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI stumbl across a predict last week that would impress even Mad Money' Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();Accord to a recent report from Oxfam, an intern charit organization, Bill Gate ha a shot at becom the world' first trillionaire. Oxfam specul that if the return on the tech mogul' $75 billion fortun in the next 25 year are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gate ha a shot at jump the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man ha a shot at becom a trillionaire, certainli one of theS&P 500′ biggest compani ha a shot at becom the world' first $1 trillion company?Turn out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 compani with a shot at break the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest compani on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook' share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) ha a market cap of $400 billion. Share would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) ha a market cap of $498 billion. Share would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is current worth $570 billion. Share would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believ everi one of these compani will eventu be worth $1 trillion. However, one other compani will beat them all to it.Thank to a varieti of factors,Appl Inc.(AAPL) is set to becom the first $1 trillion compani in the world in the next five years.Th compani ha been on a roll. After beat fourth-quart earn by 4%, share just hit a new all-tim high abov $135.That give Appl a market cap of $710 billion, make it the largest compani in the S&P 500. It ha also place Appl within strike distanc of the $1 trillion mark. Share of Appl would onli need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If it current valuat stay the same, Appl would need to grow earn by 8% annual in the next five year to hit that target. As it stands, Appl is expect to grow earn by 8% thi year and anoth 13% in 2018. Those two year alon get Appl almost half way to 50% earn growth.But even if Apple' earn grow slower than expected, it ha an ace up it sleeve.Appl Ha $246 Billion In Cash On It Balanc SheetApple' cash posit is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quart results, Apple' report a cash posit of $246 billion. Some of that cash is alreadi account for in Apple' $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Us as littl as half of it cash balanc to repurchas share add anoth $125 billion to Apple' market cap.Apple' Is One Of The Most Undervalu Stock In The S&P 500Appl is one of the most undervalu stock in the S&P 500. It forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500 20. That lower valuat exist despit the fact that Appl is project to grow earn faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Techn speak that mean Appl should be trade with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Appl trade with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, share would share would climb 25%, give Appl a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Invest In AppleApple' pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold ha attract the attent of the world' greatest investor. In recent regulatori filings, Berkshir reveal it had quadrupl it ownership in Appl to 57 million shares. Buffett' stake wa worth approxim $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With share of Appl alreadi up 17% on the year, Buffett ha pocket a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveRisk To Consider:Appl ha struggl to launch new hit in the last few years.

Mark Your Calendars: This Is When You Can Buy the Snap IPO,2/22/2017,"The most highli anticip IPO of the year final ha a date set to begin trading.Snap(NYSE: SNAP) will price it share on March 1after the market closes, which mean investor should be abl to buy share on March 2.Snap expect to price it share between $14 and $16, and it will sell 200 million share with 30 million in reserv to rais as much as $3.7 billion. The share price rang repres a market cap between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion. That' short of the $25 billion sourc origin report late last year, and veri close to the valuat at which Snap rais fund dure it seri F round about nine month ago.How doe Snap' IPO price compar to compet digit advertisers, and should investor grab share on March 2?makeArticleAd();Imag source: SnapA look at valuationAt it IPO, Snap will be worth about $21 billion. That' a bit more thanTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) , but consider less than ad giantsFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .CompanyValuationPrice-to-Sal RatioSnap$21 billion*51.9Twitter$11.7 billion4.6Facebook$386.5 billion14.1Googl (C shares)$580.9 billion6.4Data source: Snap S-1/A and Yahoo! Financ *Base on the midpoint of Snap' expect price range.Despit it rel small valuation, investor will still be pay a huge premium for Snap base on it sales. Last year, the compani brought in just $405 million in revenue. By comparison, Twitter brought in more than six time as much ($2.5 billion). Snap and it underwrit think a dollar of it sale is worth more than 10 time as much as Twitter's.Granted,Twitt is expect to see sale declinethi year, while analyst believ Snap could grow revenu around 150%. Still, Snap will trade at a huge premium to the still rapidli grow Facebook and Alphabet, which are expect to grow sale 37% and 18%, respectively.But the IPO price is still attractiveSnap' IPO price is still somewhat attract however, if but for one reason. It' nearli the same valuat as it last round of funding. Snap' trail 12 month of revenu for that round wa just $93.5 million. Snap will IPO at about one-quart the multipl of it last fund round.In that light, Snap' price look much more reasonable. If some of the smartest ventur capitalist were will to invest when Snap' latest advertis product were still at their earliest potential, it may well be worth it for investor now that Snap ha proven those product work. And if they can get it at the same price, so much the better.Y probabl won't get Snap share at $16Unfortunately, it' highli unlik you'll be abl to buy share of Snap at it IPO price on March 2. Sinc it plan to price share around the same price as it last round of funding, Snap is potenti set the stock up for a pop in the stock price befor it open on the New York Stock Exchange.That' good for Snap. Even though Snap will onli receiv fund at the price it set on March 1, a first-day pop in the stock price make it look much more attractive. (Rememb what happen toFacebook stockaft it botch IPO?)Snap itself is onli sell 145 million to 175 million share of the company' 1.2 billion share outstanding, so it' not leav too much money on the table, either, by keep it IPO price low. The other 55 million share will come from earli investor and compani officials.If you'r lucki enough to have a broker that' offer you a chanc to get in on the Snap IPO price, it may be worth consid buy a stake in the company. Even at $16 per share, however, it' still extrem risky. But don't be surpris if Snap doesn't trade publicli for that price for a long time -- if ever.10 stock we like better than Snap Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes,2/22/2017,"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenet of hi invest strategy, a prefer for compani with seriou ""competit moats"" -- attribut that give them the abil to sustain keep ahead of their competition. But base on hi rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerg industri like self-driv cars, and hi competit moat idea don't necessarili hold water in thi world. If you'r a fan of the Oracl of Omaha, bewar of follow hi invest philosophi into these three mistakes.1. Focus too much on sizeImag source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economi of scale are an import indic for almost ani company. As the logic goes, the bigger a compani is, the greater it abil to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) abil to keep it car cost lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just base on the fact that it produc more econom design vehicles. It' also due to the fact that Ford produc 1.5 million car in the third quarter of 2016, compar to the 24,800 car Tesla Motor deliv dure the same period.But scalabl in the driverless car industri doesn't necessarili have anyth to do with car sales. The automak with the best technolog may ultim come out ahead. Technolog is scalabl at almost no cost. When Tesla Motor wirelessli upload it latest softwar to it already-sold vehicl around the world, the compani pay nearli noth in per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at thi stage ha much more to do with technolog than with number of vehicl sold, and the quantiti of car a compani ha sold thu far isn't a indic for which compani is best place to scale in the future.2. Exagger the valu of network effectsWhat network?Network effect are often tout as one of the strongest competit moat around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectli defin the allur of the network effect. If everyon is use a specif product or platform, it can be extrem difficult for anoth compani to make inroads.At first glance, driverless car seem to be an excel opportun to build network effects. If one company' car all ""talk"" to each other as they navig the roads, they'll get to their destin faster and more safe than competitors' -- right? Wrong. Driverless car technolog must necessarili take into account public safety, and unique, exclusionari network fli in the face of a univers platform for safe self-driv cars. Automak engag in thi space alreadi know this; it' whi Ford, Tesla, and other are equip their driverless car with the best real-world object detect technolog available.When Ford announc earlier last week that it would invest $1 billion over five year in Argo AI, it wasn't becaus the startup ha thousand of self-driv car on the road -- it wa becaus the company' robot expertis ""give Ford a distinct competit advantag at the intersect of the automot and technolog industries,"" explain Ford Chief Technolog Offic Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't reli on Google' treasur trove of data to guid it vehicl as they drive around. Instead, Waymo car are equip with sensor and softwar design to detect obstacl up to ""two footbal field away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and other aren't interest in network effect in thi arena. They'r interest in their car have the most acut local-area awar they can contain.3. Expect govern regul to limit competitionRegular regulationRegul can provid some of the widest competit moat around. If onli one compani is abl to meet all the regulatori requir of be in a business, it' essenti illeg for other to tri to compet with it. The driverless car industri recogn this, and is make move to ensur a level play field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Car join togeth last April to creat the ""Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Streets, "" a lobbi group whose state mission is to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realiz the safeti and societ benefit of self-driv vehicles."" These compani are interest in standard nation polici with simpl and low-cost barrier to entri for all interest automakers. So for Buffett fan look to back the compani with the strongest regulation-rel advantages, know that some of the biggest name in the busi are work proactiv to push polici that ensur no compani can ever build a regulatori moat.Pick the right self-driv car stockWarren Buffett is an incred investor, but he doesn't have answer for everi industry. There are mani open question around self-driv cars, and some compani are morepois to profitthan others. Rather than stick to one-size-fits-al invest mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make inform investments, and set your portfolio to auto-pilot for year to come.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There would have to be a scandal of monument proportions, or some incred innov new method of searching, to chang thi significantly.Alphabet' 17% year-over-year increas in advertis revenu to $22.4 billion come as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantast Aggreg paid click up 36%, paid click on Googl properti up 43%, and paid click on Network properti up 7%. A lot of peopl freak out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the abov categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realiz that thi is becaus more advertis is be push to mobile.A for Other Bets, which is basic the company' VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollar in the quarter. But consid free cash flow wa $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL ha that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it take is one of these VC bet to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.Thi brief glanc tell me that Alphabet is an advertis busi with domin market share that is liter print money. I mean, it gener $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, mean it can do whatev it want with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat' even after spend about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continu to examin other part of the busi if I were look to includ GOOGLin someth like my forthcom stock advisori newsletter, The Liberti Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investor continu their own due dilig and strongli consid GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?,2/21/2017,"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recent introduc Chime, an enterpris collabor servic for onlin meetings, video conferencing, voic calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime' app work on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchron across all platform via Amazon Web Servic (AWS).Chim come in three version -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voic and video call and chat; Chime Plus, which add screen share and the integr of compani directories; and Chime Pro, which add tool for scheduling, hosting, recording, and person meet for up to 100 people.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Thes featur indic that Amazon is take aim at collabor tool likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rival alreadi too deepli entrench in the enterpris market for Amazon to disrupt? Let' take a closer look at Amazon' game plan to find out.Ent the crowd Saa marketAmazon' AWS, which ha an annual run rate of $14 billion, is the biggest cloud infrastructur platform in the world. It' sever time larger than it closest competitor, Microsoft' Azure. But while AW domin the cloud platform (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which host storag space, process power, and other tool for compani and develop -- it doesn't have a major presenc in the Saa (softwar as a service) market yet.Th Saa market is the crowded, consumer-fac side of the cloud, which includ servic like Microsoft' Offic 365, Dynam CRM, and Skype. The lion' share of Microsoft' commerci cloud revenu run rate of $14 billion is gener by those Saa product instead of Azure. Microsoft ha also been expand Skype' capabl as an enterpris collabor tool with Microsoft Teams, which enhanc Skype' cloud-bas commun featur and tightli integr the servic into Offic 365.Microsoft Teams. Imag source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, network giant Cisco aggress bundl softwar and secur product with it routers, switches, and unifi comput systems. Those bundl includ collabor tool like Spark, the cloud-bas platform for messages, meetings, and call it launch in late 2015. Last quarter, Cisco' collabor revenu rose 4% annual to $1.06 billion -- make it it third largest busi after it core busi of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the onli player in the crowd field of cloud-bas collabor tools.Alphabet' Googl ha been promot Hangout to enterpris custom over the past year,Boxha ad collabor tool on top of it cloud storag platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix' GoToMeet video conferenc platform for the same purposes. However, all these challeng notabl lack Microsoft and Cisco' clout in the enterpris market.That' whi Amazon believ it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also ha leverag -- the grow import of AW to enterpris customers. Amazon like believ that by offer Chime as an extens of AW (especi with it 30-day free trial) to it enterpris custom base, it can gain a foothold in the crowd ""unifi communication"" platform market.Amazon previous launch enterpris Saa product like WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever releas offici growth figur for those products. However, most industri watcher believ that those product are still dwarf by compar solut from Microsoft and Cisco. Thi strongli indic that AWS' domin of the PaaS/Iaa market doesn't guarante that Chime will becom a Skype or Spark killer anytim soon. Chime Pro also cost more than Skype for Busi -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plan to undercut it way into the market.Th key takeawayChim sound like a logic way for AW to straddl the PaaS/Iaa and Saa markets, but it' easier said than done. The market for cloud-bas unifi commun platform is incred crowded, and it' doubt that a new servic -- even one bundl with AW -- can claim a meaning slice of the market.

3 Virtual Reality Stock Investing Tips That Will Pay Off Long Term,2/21/2017,"Virtual realiti (VR) is forecast to becom a $162 billion market by 2020, and the opportun for investor to benefit are growing. Nearli everi major technolog compani is pursu VR, or at least look into it, and some are spend billion in order to make it the next popular comput platform.So how can individu investor benefit from all of this? Start with these three tips:Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Don't focu on hardwareYou'r probabl hear a lot about VR headset these days. Oculu releas it long-await Rift headset last year;Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) purchas the compani more than two year ago for $2 billion.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStat VR headset launch back in October, give PS4 user the abil to play and view VR content on their consoles. AndAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recent launch it new mobil VR headset, call the Daydream View. The compani also just hire a key VR headset design away from HTC, which make the popular HTC Vive headset.But don't focu on ani of that.VR headset and other hardwar are clearli an import part of thi market, but the real gain will come from softwar and services. Tom Mainelli, vice presid of devic and AR/VR at IDC, said last year that ""... what peopl can do with that hardwar will depend upon the applic and servic that power it.""Accord to IDC, hardwar sale will account for more than half of VR and augment realiti (AR) revenu through 2020, but that it' softwar and servic that have the real long-term potential.""AR/VR softwar revenu will also get off to a quick start, grow more than 200% year over year in 2016, but will quickli be overtaken by servic revenu in the middl year of the forecast, as logist and manufactur demand enterprise-class support,"" Mainelli said.Th bigger, the betterIn the technolog sector, it' often the player that start out the biggest that win in the end, and virtual realiti will like be the same.That' whi it' import to look at what Facebook, Alphabet, and Soni are do in the space. Facebook' long-term goal isn't to just sell high-end VR headsets, but rather to creat the next wide adopt comput platform.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in aninterviewwithBusi Insid last year that Facebook is ""mostli interest in the software"" aspect of VR, though he note that the earli stage of VR develop will requir a focu on both hardwar and software.Hi long-term goal for AR and VR is to creat an entir new comput platform. ""So I do think a new comput platform alway emerg everi 10 or 15 years. VR is current the most promis candidate,"" he said.Whil Facebook is look ahead to the next comput platform, Alphabet is busi focus on how it can gain from the mobil VR market. The compani recent debut it Daydream platform for Android user to find VR video and apps.Th import of thi VR hub can't be overstated. Smaller compani may be make VR content, but Alphabet' Googl ha built one of the onli place where all of thi content can live, and be easili found. As mobil VR take off, Daydream will like be the place where user go to get their content. Think of it like a Googl Play store for VR.And while Facebook and Alphabet are busi build out platforms, don't forget Sony' potenti to make itself a powerhous in the VR game market. The compani alreadi work with more than 230 develop and publish to creat 160 PlayStat VR softwar titles.Sony' Game and Network Servic is the company'ssecond-most profitablebusiness, and the compani ha said the VR ""offer great futur potential"" for the segment.Stay the courseHonestly, the payoff for VR investor will like take some time to materialize. That' becaus while the market is grow fast, VR repres onli a small portion of revenu -- if ani -- for mani of the compani involv in the space right now.Facebook said it invest in VR weren't materi to the company' 2016 financials, and Zuckerberg ha state sever time that VR probabl won't truli take off for anoth five to 10 years.But that shouldn't be a deterr for investors. Virtual realiti ha the potenti to transform how peopl access information, view content, and interact with each other. If it doe becom the next big comput platform, then take a long-term approach to the will be the wise course.Investor should heed thi advic Zuckerberg gave last year: ""We are bet that virtual realiti is go to be an import technology. I am pretti confid about this. And now is the time to invest.""10 stock we like better than FacebookWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The drama, which ha been more than cover by the media, culmin with theresign of multibillionair Viacom Chairmanand former CEO Sumner Redstone. Now, with the appoint of new CEO Robert Bakish, the situat appear to be on the mend, which is great news, becaus all ha not been well, not onli in the C-suite, but on the incom statement as well:Metric20162015ChangeRevenue$3.32 billion$3.15 billion5%Oper income$706 million$839 million(16%)Dilut EPS$1.00$1.13(12%)Data source:Viacom Februari 9, 2017 Quarterli Earn Results.Whil revenu were obvious head in the right direction, profit were not -- which partial explain the company' low earn multiple. However, thi ha not alway been the case. In fact, lacklust growth could veri well be consid an anomali in the company' oper history.A look backHistorically, Viacom ha a histori of profit growth and solid return on capital. In fact, it record over the year ha been quit good.VIAB Normal Dilut EP (TTM)data byYCharts.Alas, perhap caus by or contribut to the myriad problem at the top that the public ha been more than privi to over the past year, the company' momentum ha been all but derailed. Fortunately, there lie a strong case to be made that the company' inher advantag remain intact, and brighter day lie ahead.Cont is king!Viacom wa built into what it is today by 93-year-old Sumner Redstone, who built hi empir on the belief that it wa content, not distribution, that would fuel the entertain industri in the decad ahead. When he made thi shift, in the 1970 when he wa work for hi father' Nation Amus theater chain, thi wa a novel innovation. Today, the world ha caught onto thi insight and is give the compani a run for it money. However, thi should not detract from the company' prime properties, network like MTV (and it deriv channels), as well as Nickelodeon, Comedi Central, Spike, BET, and CMT. On top of all this, the compani is also the owner of Paramount Studios.Despit increas competit from all quarters, Viacom' network are hold their own. For the quarter end Decemb 31, 2016, Media Networks' revenu rose 1% to $2.6 billion -- and thi ignor an avers 2% impact due to foreign exchang losses. Soft in total advertis revenu (-2% to $1.29 billion) wa balanc out by an increas in affili (essenti international) revenues, which climb 2% to $1.14 billion. These result are noth to write home about, but they aren't terrible, either. All the more, when look at the situat holist and hold share up to the light of it enviabl brand and good-not-great recent financi results, share becom increasingli attract when one reflect on their current valuation.VIAB PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Should Viacom be abl to right the ship, investor will more than like be handsom reward given the stock' histor low valuation. Here, the situat appear to be posit as well. Manag is no longer distract by the drama surround the departur of Sumner Redston and will be abl to focu on intern expans of it brands. Also, Paramount Studio ha recent been given a ""booster shot"" of sort via a$1 billion dollar, 3-year dealbi Chines film studio Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media. The cash infusion, coupl with the potenti for allow Paramount to make strong inroad into the fast-grow Chines film market all bode well.

The fact is, the compani face threat from all quarters, from individu in their home post comed video on YouTub to Time Warner'sHBO.

Compani likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attract a lot of investor attent for (among other things) their self-driv efforts, but -- as of right now, at least -- GM seem pois to leapfrog just about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like it larger rival Uber Technologies, know that replac it human driver with self-driv vehicl is crucial to it future. Autonom ride-hail vehicl will allow Lyft to lower it price while gener (hopefully) strong profits.Ub ha been work on it own self-driv technolog for a coupl of years, and ha a fewprototyp self-driv test car in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done ani work on a self-driv system of it own, but it doesn't need to: GMown a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seem to have it handled.If Lyft beat Uber to a self-driv fleet at scale, Uber will have a big challeng on it hands.GM presid Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-found Logan Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM own 9% of the ride-hail company, and Ammann is a member of it board of directors. Imag source: Gener Motors.Could thi be for real?Th Reuter report, by veteran auto-busi journalist Paul Lienert, cite two unnam ""sourc familiar with the automaker' plans."" Generally, investor (and everyon else) should take report base on inform from unnam sourc with a grain or two of salt. But a few thing suggest to me that thi is probabl for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuter hold it report to high standards. Second, the report fit with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonom GM vehicl in Lyft servic is forthcoming. Third, GM' Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built, ha plenti of capac to do a special product run in the thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM deni the report. In fact, GM' statement in respons wa almost a smile hint:W do not provid specif detail on potenti futur product or technolog rollout plans. We have said that our AV technolog will appear in an on-demand ride share network applicationsoon than you might think. [Emphasi added.]Translation: Thi is like to happen, and it might begin sooner than 2018.How import is thi for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a ""race"" to self-driv technologyisn't realli use to investors, a big test like thi next year (or sooner) will show that GM isn't about to be disrupt by Silicon Valley when it come to self-driving. It will also give lot of peopl an opportun to experi self-driv technolog firsthand, which will almost certainli speed it adopt by increas consum demand.If noth else, it seem veri like to attract investors' attent and give GM share a boost.10 stock we like better than Gener MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Does Thinking About Your IRA Give You Heartburn? Let Us Help,2/17/2017,"An IRA is a fantast retir save tool, but mani American don't take advantag of it, and when they do, they fail to make the most of it. If you'r among them, don't worry. Here are some rule to help you build a bigger nest egg with an IRA.What are IRAs?A a refresher, you can get big tax benefit by save money for retir in a tradit IRA or a Roth IRA.In 2017, you can set asid up to $5,500 of your earn in either a tradit IRA or a Roth IRA or a combin of the two. If you'r 50 year old or older, then you can save up to $6,500 of your earn in an IRA.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAG SOURCE: GETTi IMAGES.Tradit IRA can be fund with pre-tax money, which mean that money you put in now isn't tax at your current tax rate. Instead, that money, and ani futur gains, are tax when it withdrawn. Becaus of thi feature, tradit IRA can make sens if you think your incom tax rate in retir will belowerthan it is today.Alternatively, Roth IRA are fund with after-tax money, which mean you'r pay tax on your contribut now so that you can withdraw them -- and futur gain -- tax-fre in retirement. Becaus of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make sens if you expect your incom tax rate in retir to behigherthan it is today.Som import IRA withdraw rulesIn the case of a tradit IRA, if you don't wait until you'r at least 59.5 year old, the IR will charg you incom tax on ani money that you withdraw, plu a 10% penalty, unless you qualifi for an earli withdraw exempt (more on that in a minute).In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contribut tax-fre at ani age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA ha been establish for at least five years. However, ani gain that you withdraw prior to reach age 59.5 can be subject to incom tax and penalties.Both tradit IRA and Roth IRA do allow penalti free, earli withdraw in specif instances. A full list of these exempt can be foundhere, but the big one to know about includ purchas a first home (up to $10,000), or payingcolleg tuitionfor you, or an immedi relative, such as a spous or child. The rule for take advantag of these exempt can be quit complex, so make sure you consult a tax profession befor take ani earli withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want is a surpris at tax time!Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think you'll need to withdraw contribut five or more year from now, and you won't be 59.5 year old or qualifi for an earli withdraw exempt at that time.Navig the IRA incom capsIn order to qualifi for a tax deduct on a tradit IRA contribution, your modifi adjust gross incom ha to be below set limit if you, or your spouse, are cover by a retir plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribut to a Roth IRA, your modifi adjust gross incom need to be below set limit too.Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job at explain adjust incom limit for IRA'shere, but in short, if you'r singl and you are cover by a retir plan at work, you can take the full deduct on a tradit IRA contribut if your adjust incom is below $62,000 in 2017. You can qualifi for a partial deduct if your adjust incom is between $62,000 and $72,000.If you'r single, you can make a contribut to a Roth IRA as long as your adjust incom is less than $118,000. You can make a partial contribut if your adjust incom is between $118,000 and $133,000.If you'r marri file jointli and cover by a retir plan at work, then you can take a tax deduct on your tradit IRA contribution, as long as your adjust incom is below $99,000. A partial deduct is possibl if your adjust incom is between $99,000 and $119,000.If you'r not cover by a plan at work but your spous is, then you can make a tax deduct contribut to tradit IRA if your adjust incom is below $186,000 or a partial deduct if your adjust incom is between $186,000 and $196,000.If you'r marri file jointly, you can contribut to a Roth IRA as long as your adjust incom is below $184,000. A partial contribut can be made if your incom is between $184,000 and $194,000.If you think you'r close to these limit and you'r unsur of how to calcul your modifi adjust gross income, you can read up on the subjecthere.How to invest in an IRAOnc you'v contribut to an IRA, you'll need to pick some investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think care about your age, your health, and the number of year you have until you begin withdrawals.If you'r young, in good health, and have plenti of year to ride out the inevit recession, then an IRA that includ stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual fund can make sense. Usually, buy and hold stock and ETF for long period of time is cheaper than buy an activ manag mutual fund, so make sure that you balanc the potenti return, risk, and expens associ with these choices.Som investor may prefer own individu stock for the long term, such as disrupt growth compani likeAmazonorAlphabet. Other investor may prefer own an S&P 500 ETF that track the stock market' return more closely. If so, a low-cost S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is theVanguardS&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . It ha an annual expens ratio of just 0.05%.It may also pay off to own dividend-pay stock in an IRA. Becaus IRA offer tax advantages, dividend payment can compound over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potenti tax-free. Historically, dividend-pay stock have outperform non-dividend-pay stocks. However, the perform ofdividend stockstend to be lower dure period of rise interest rates, when they have to compet with bond for incom investors' attention.Overall, build a diversifi IRA that includ exposur to stock and stock ETF can provid financi secur in retirement. For example, if you'r 30, and you contribut $5,500 per year for 35 year and earn a hypothet 6% return per year, then you'll have a nest egg valu at $612,886 at age 65. That' not chump change, so make sure that you take advantag of thi power save tool.Th $16,122 Social Secur bonu most retire complet overlookIf you'r like most Americans, you'r a few year (or more) behind on your retir savings. But a hand of little-known ""Social Secur secrets"" could help ensur a boost in your retir income. For example: one easi trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year!

Appl hasn't even wait for the numer tax concess that it sought from the India govern includ the 15-year custom duti holiday.Analyst observ that it wa prudent on part of Appl to begin assembl it most econom iPhon offering, SE, which wa launch to cater to cost sensit market like India. Plus, it also will support futur iO upgrad unlik iPhon 5S, which will soon be discontinu in most of the market includ India.Appl Inc. PriceAppl Inc. Price|Appl Inc. QuoteWhi is Appl Keen on India?Sinc the last year, Appl ha been increas it focu on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphon market, of which it reportedli hold onli 2% as of now. Appl face slow iPhon demand in most of the regions, either becaus of competit or regulatori hurdl (China) or market satur (the U.S). Therefore, it make sens for the compani to solidifi it posit in India, which is project to becom the second largest smartphon market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Appl sale in India grew approxim 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) popul and increas invest in broadband network by the govern also make India an attract growth opportun for Appl over the long run. In fact, the govern under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capit and boost manufactur facil in India.Th recent outlin FDI polici also bode well for the compani as it elimin the requir to local sourc product for at least a three-year period. Thi will enabl Appl to open it solely-own retail store in India. Thereafter, the compani will have to compli with the rule. The compani ha also partner with telecom compani Reliance, which is provid it Jio (a uniqu all-IP network) servic for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook wa on a charm offens in India.

Reportedly, major of the smartphon sold are price around INR 10K (roughli $145). iPhon 7 on the other hand cost almost five time more. Even iPhon SE is price at INR 30K. The lion' share of Apple' revenu in the countri come from devices, which are a coupl of gener old. Newer model have rel low demand given the hefti price tag. A few day back, it wa report that the Appl team in India is tri to increas revenu to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembl operations, the compani can start to oper it own retail outlet and avail a 10% tax benefit. Thi should lower prices.Plus, Apple' rival Samsung along with a few Chines smartphon maker domin thi market. Samsung ha long been in the market and with reportedli 23% share, it is a lead player in the country. Appl is quit late to the party.Also, Apple' lack of focu on region customers' demand is a concern.

Although manag didn't scale back on plan to increas capit spending, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the social media giant wa aim for shorter-form content, ha made clear that FB intend to domin video, which is where the bulk of it capex will go.And, that spend ha alreadi begun.Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fli to $1,000 in 2017Last week Facebook hire Mina Lefevre, former head of script develop atViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIA). Thi hire can onli be for one reason: to increas Facebook' transit toward develop origin content. Contrari to popular opinion, Zuckerberg is not push Facebook to becom a televis network, nor doe he envis the compani compet withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). Hi drive to becom a ""video-first"" compani ha everyth to do with sell more ads.From my vantag point, the reason Facebook must spend money is becaus it ha begun to experi a problem thatTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) craves: It ha run out of ad space on it news feeds. But, Facebook doesn't want to sacrific the user experi without first know what sort of video user will want to see - and how to make them less intrusive.To that end, Lefevre, whose track record at Viacom-own MTV Network includ produc teen-focus content, is a solid hire. To the extent Facebook' shorter-form content can put it into the realm ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertis juggernaut YouTube, it would have been money well spent.7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear StrikeIn that regard, given Zuckerberg' Midas-lik qualities, it would be a mistak to avoid FB stock sole on the fear of high capex. It would make more sens to focu on the return Facebook can realiz from it investments.Bottom Line for FB StockFacebook - as it promis in the third quarter - ha signal that it will be in a period of transition. Investors, however, are now take their time to see how the increas spend balanc out with management' warn of slow ad growth. While thi might put FB stock in limbo, now is also the time to look at the big picture.

And, even dure that crisi - where it market cap wa cut in half and other compani collaps complet - BlackRock did not cut that dividend.America' Best Banker?CEO and co-found Larri Fink is not often mention in the same breath as banker like Jami Dimon ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein ofGoldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS); he just doe better for hi investors.7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveBlackRock wasfound in 1988with oper capit from Pete Peterson of the Blackston Group, from which it separ in 1995 after a disput withStephen Schwarzmann, orchestr withPNC Financi Servic Group Inc(NYSE:PNC), whose invest arm came into BlackRock in 1998.

In 2015, BLK bought the 108-stori landmark, the world' tallest build when complet in 1973, for $1.3 billion.For BlackRock, that' a small deal, actually. It' current buy First Reserv Energi Infrastructur Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-produc energi project like mid-stream pipelines, grab for Trump' infrastructur moneywith both hands.Fink is skeptic of the Trump rally, and of the President' plan for the dollar. Fink still love the Mexican peso and is worri about the futur of the global economi in the age of Trump. But, BlackRock keep polit and busi separate, it respons to the travel ban mainli a letter to employees.BlackRock' ETF busi hasmor than $1 trillion in assets.It consid Russia a buy, but is skeptic of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequ Georg Osborn join BLK as an adviser.Trad Apple, Inc. or Own It?

It brought approxim one-third of revenu to the net incom line becaus most of it money came in the form of invest advisori fees, from administr fee and secur lending.Bottom Line for BlackRock StockWhen BlackRock plung into a stock, it can hold up, despit real busi pressures.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Worry About Oracle,2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAl too much like Jame Cameron' 2009 sci-fi flickAvatar, just when you think the feud betweenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is over, you find out it' not.* Last week, the icon databas compani told the icon search engin compani it wa appeal a rule made against Oracl - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owner either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it' the latter, it' not terribl surprising. The compani formerli known as Googl is su on a regular basis, often by parti with weak case just look for a payday.GOOGL sharehold may want to take a closer look thi time around though. While success appeal case are tough, Oracle' argument hold slightli more water than the typic long-shot caselik the one Vringo levi (and ultim lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have signific repercuss for other outfit in the heat of similar argument about open sourc software.GOOGL: Here We Go AgainWarning: You may need to read through the intricaci of thi case twice to fulli understand what' go on, and even then, there' no guarante it will make complet sense. Here' the crux of the argument though … Oracl say Alphabet use a littl too much of it Java softwar - which is free, open-sourc softwar - in it Android oper system.Th suit larg hing on what constitut ""fair use"" of open-sourc and freely-avail software.7 Stock to Buy for the Futur of TVWhile Oracl offer Java for ani consum to download and ani develop to util piec of, the compani contend it wa never intend for wide swath of the code to be cut and past and util as part of a commercial, revenue-bear system.Th complaint specif read:""Th undisput evid show that Googl verbatim copi the heart of Oracle' creativ work for an entir commerci purpos without ani chang to Oracle' express content or message, took far more than necessari to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harm the market for Java.""Th strength of Oracle' copyright on it applic program interfaces, or APIs, wa particularlyemphasizedbi the compani in the prior juri trial.Alphabet' counterargu is simpler -CEO Larri Page said, ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""If all of thi ring a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there' a reason. Thi argument ha been wage in a courtroom a few times, go back as far as 2010. The current stage for thi battl of the titan is an appeal of last year' loss suffer by Oracle. That case' loss like save Alphabet Inc from be forc to pay the $9 billion in damag Oracl wa seeking.Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and OthersOwn of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worri about here. The court side with the compani in the most recent case, and appeal - a revers of a prior judgment - are veri difficult win.Th case, though, will have far-reach consequ beyond the Alphabet/Oracl tiff. In essence, thi contest could larg help affirm just how ""open"" open sourc code realli is even if it user end up commerci it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhap in a bigger sens though, thi trial will onc again serv as an indict on decenc (or lack thereof) and common sens (or, again, lack thereof).Whi Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fli to $1,000 in 2017While not a legal matter rais dure ani of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror' mind were apt to be ask themselv whi Oracl would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commerci use - if it didn't want it to be use thi extensively.Anoth relev but unask question is whi Java' origin developer, Sun Microsystems, support Android' use of the platform befor Oracl acquir Sun, but Oracl switch gear on the stanc after buy Sun Microsystems. And, perhap if Oracl had been more clear about how it rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harm the market for Java"" when it' not realli otherwis monetized, a judg and juri could have been a littl more sympathetic.A it stand though, the Oracl argument look to be found more on regret and frustrat and less on merits. The court so far seem to be pick up on that.Broadli speaking, it all bode well for other entiti that have somehow commerci open sourc softwar and APIs.* Avatar, while a stunningli success film, wa a three hour epic, and could have easili end at two point in the film befor the third (and actual) ending.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy Today10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatTh postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holder Shouldn't Worri About Oracleappear first onInvestorPlace."
"Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",2/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) ha certainli made a tremend comeback sinc 2008, after have to declar bankruptcy. But there ha been littl for investor to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the compani pull off it IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at onli $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliv via Flickr (Modified)To put thing into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn ha noted: ""Ever sinc the 2008 crash and govern bailout, Gener Motor stock ha been treat like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actual think thi is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventu investor will recogn the value. Hey, thi ha happen with other stock that languish for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investor hold off? Well, to see, let' take a look at 3 pro and con on Gener Motors:3 Pro On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, Gener Motor ha post record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenu increas by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flow came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previou year.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteThen again, Gener Motor ha continu to pump out popular cars, with global sale at 10 million (make the compani the No. 3 player). A big part of thi ha been the continu success in North America. But of course, China remain a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sale in the country. Keep in mind that the compani sell more in China than ani country, includ the U.S.But GM ha also been judici with discount and promotions. For the most part, GM is focus on make sure it make profits, not just on increas marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categori in technolog is the auto industry, as seen with the effort with oper likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM ha been ramp up it investments. To thi end, the compani made a $500 million invest inLyft(a top ride-shar startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisit ofCruis Automation(a develop of autonom car systems).Alreadi there are sign that GM is get traction. For example, the compani is test over 40 autonom Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. Thi is a mobil platform that allow a person to search and reserv a car and unlock it with a smartphone. Accord toGM: ""With more than 25 million custom around the world project to use some form of share mobil by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategi to chang ownership model in the automot industry.""It' import to note that GM ha the advantag of leverag it experi with OnStar, which ha been around for two decades. In fact, dure thi time, the system ha log about1.5 billion custom interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM ha certainli been sharehold friendly. Last year, the compani return a hefti $4.8 billion - in a combin of share buyback and dividends. In fact, GM stock ha a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuat is also attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn ratio is at a lowli 6.1X. True, thi may be deserv for a compani that is show declin growth. But as for Gener Motors, the compani expect to increas the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock doe look like a great valu play right now.3 Con on GM StockCompetition: The environ is brutal. And with more dealmaking, thing will onli get more intense. An exampl of thi is the allianc ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involv the purchas of a larg stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the compani were abl to realiz signific cost save and also hit a global sale number of nearli 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automak may need to reach level of15 million car sold annual to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevit increas becaus of the enorm cost of new technologies.A a result, a compani like GM may have littl choic but to look for a similar allianc or a transform acquisition, which would definit be riski and expensive.Politics: The elect of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potenti positives, such as with lower corpor tax rate and less oner regulations.But these may not offset the issu with Trump' anti-trad bent. If there is a border tax, thi could hurt GM becaus of it substanti product in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light product is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher price in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. Accord to theWal Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consider would wipe out a quarter of GM' region profit.""Glob Issues:Whil the market in China and North America have been robust for GM, there ha been much soft in mani other areas, such as in Europ and South America. Granted, there are sign of improv - but the progress ha been fairli slow. For example, in South America, GM ha been abl to cut back on the losses. But there wa still $374 million in red ink last year.A for Europe, the growth ha been sluggish across the continent. It also doe not help that England ha enact the Brexit, which ha caus a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europ last year and it appear there will not be break-even until 2018. To put thing into perspective, the compani ha not seen a profit in the region sinc 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhap the biggest issu face GM stock is the uncertainti regard Trump' trade actions. Although, given the import of the auto industri to the US economy, it doe seem reason that ani move will like be taken with care. Besides, Gener Motor CEO Mari Barra ha been savvi to meet with Trump sever time already.Ga Up With Chesapeak Energi Corpor (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is do a great job manag the core oper of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refresh model for five main brand in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra ha been aggress with invest in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especi given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand also ha hi own free iO app to estim your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Twitter and Alphabet,2/15/2017,"For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - Februari 15, 2017 - Today, Zack Invest Idea featur highlight Features: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Fre Report)and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Fre Report).How Twitter Can Fix Itself by Learn from YouTubeWhen Donald Trump first began gain some momentum in the presidenti race, it look to be pretti fantast news for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Fre Report), and investor in the social network giant too. After all, Trump would frequent go onto the site to announc new plan or fight back against hi detractors. It wa (and continu to be) an incred resourc for polit updates.Now that Trump is President, hi tweet move markets. Hi attack on compani can send share price lower in a heartbeat and are an import thing to consid for investor these days. Some haveset up app to track hi tweetsand how they relat to the market. Other do a tweet analysi in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, includingTh Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker.But beyond Trump, Twitter also manag to becom the singl greatest collect of primari sourc of all-time. When break news happens, it is almost alway report first hand on Twitter, and then it is dissemin out from there.You'd think that these factor alon would make Twitter an unstopp media juggernaut. A must for journalist and those seek to stay up-to-d on the news alike. So how ha Twitter capit on thi incred time and presidenti stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.Bad Earn Report AgainTh compani post yet anoth disappoint quarter for Q4, miss expect on the revenu front and post shockingli poor activ user figures. It remain stuck around the 320 million activ monthli user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenu either. Add in disappoint adjust earn guidance, and it isn't a great situat by ani stretch forTWTRinvestor these days, especi given that the compani ha a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).And let' remember, these figur are with the leader of the free world liter use the servic to clarifi polici and goal on a regular basis. The environ cannot possibl get ani better for Twitter. It product is in the news on a near hourli basi at thi point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter need a shakeup and it need a bit of a Hail-Mari in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the compani do?Twitt Need to Copi YouTube. Now.Fortun for Twitter, the path to relev and growth is alreadi laid out befor them. The good folk at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Fre Report) have alreadi done all the hard work in their YouTub divis and Twitter need onli to copi their best practices.First and foremost is capit on the incred miss opportun of get an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the pictur below, there is alway a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Whi not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some peopl are not go to like that, but peopl will adjust accordingly. We saw someth similar with YouTub where at first onli certain video had ads, and now nearli everyth ha an advertis befor the video. Peopl have adapt and it ha becom the norm to see thi befor a video. Peopl will do the same with Twitter (and embed tweets) and thi will help with casual user (much the same way embed help with casual YouTubers).Aft all, these casual user who mostli see tweet embed somewher els make up a huge base of peopl and are arguabl the key to Twitter' success. Find a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTub doesn't need you to be sign in or make video to make revenu off of you-should be paramount in Twitter' near term plans.Accord to Twitter,embed tweet reach more than a billion peopleeach month across the web, a truli massiv figure. And that number is actual from befor Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweet were on the nightli news on a regular basis.But what if peopl hate thi idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easi way to placat peopl will be to pay the content gener for the work they are doing. Give tweeter a slice of the ad revenu that they gener would go a long way to get peopl and small busi to tweet more, and it is pretti much akin to what YouTub doe with their stars. AndTwitt ha even look to do thi on the video side, so whi not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAr some of these idea go to be popular? Definit not. But Twitter need to tri someth in order to jumpstart it flounder share price and lacklust growth. Everyth need to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.Th compani find itself in a truli histor posit and it is an opportun that isn't go to come around everi four years. The confluenc of Trump and the increas desir for real-tim (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the compani ha complet fail to capit on the trend.Tak some of YouTube' best practic might be a good place to start in order to return to relev though. It certainli ha a better shot of reviv the stock than anyth Twitter ha come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back toward growth too.And a posit of growth would make Twitter a much better candid for a takeover, perhap from a compani like Alphabet. Such a partnership make a lot of sens and it would allow better integr between Googl search result and tweets, while the meld of tweet and YouTub comment would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter want to get to thi end-which seem like the best possibl outcom for TWTR investor at thi point-tak a page out of YouTube' book and start think about way to get more ad out there, and how to benefit creator in the process. Becaus if Twitter can't take some risk and find a way to make thing work when their servic is at the forefront of news and popular cultur like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Get the full Report on TWTR - FREEGet the full Report on GOOGL - FREEFollow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/ZacksResearchJoin us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearchZack Invest Research is under common control with affili entiti (includ a broker-deal and an invest adviser), which may engag in transact involv the forego secur for the client of such affiliates.Media ContactZack Invest Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.com/performancePast perform is no guarante of futur results.

How Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Turns Lemons Into Profits,2/14/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOv the past few months,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) ha had to revis it advertis metric sever time to account for errors. For the most part, the error seem rel minor and have had littl impact on FB stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Via Stock SnapIn September, manag disclos that the report figur of averag time spent view a video wa inflated. A compani post in Novemb cite a summari figur of ""reach"" (the number of Facebook user who view an impress in their timeline) as be overstated.In two more post the follow month, further problem were announc and more chang were made. The compani chang it methodolog for measur reach (not just report the figure). ""Reactions"" to live video were mis-allocated, and count for ""likes"" and ""shares"" had been miscalculated.Again, Facebook stock investor seem rel unconcerned. In fact, the FB stock price sit at an all-tim high. But, combin with gener concern about ""click fraud"" and other problem in the onlin advertis space, the metric chang highlight a key issu for Facebook - and onlin advertis as a whole.How Facebook respond as a compani will be key for Facebook stock.Click Fraud, Bot and Facebook' ResponseIn a wide cite figure, the Associ of Nation Advertis estim that onlin ad fraud would cost $7.2 billion in 2016. (Bear in mind that Facebook alon gener $27 billion in revenu last year.) Estim of how mani ad are fraudul rang from 30%-60%. Indeed, mani analyst have forecast a collaps in the onlin advertis space as a whole.7 Stock to Buy That Could Doubl by 2018Much of the question activ come from bots, which mimic actual onlin users. There are also ""click farms,"" malwar and display tactic such as ""pop-under"" ads, which are rarely, if ever, seen. Most of the complaint are direct at traffic gener and other middlemen. But, some argu that programmat marketplac oper such asRocket Fuel Inc(NASDAQ:FUEL) andCriteo SA (ADR)(NASDAQ:CRTO) are turn a blind eye to these issues.Facebook is not implic in these tactics. In fact, the company' effort outsid the platform have shown a notabl willing to fight low-qual tactics. In 2016, Facebook shut down it Atla ad-buy platform. It head of ad tech wrote in a blog post, ""We were amaz by the volum of valueless inventory"" come into that exchange. That poor traffic wa a key reason for management' decis to move on.Anoth unit, LiveRail, wa shut down last year as well. Facebook paid a report $400 million-$500 million for that company, with the goal of build a video ad exchange. But, similar to Atlas, fraud and traffic concern led FB to shut down the ad exchange. (In both cases, Facebook ha salvag measur capabl from the business.)Th ironi of the question surround Facebook' metric chang is that, so far, when confront with the worst of the worst in onlin advertising, the compani ha act in a seemingli ethic manner.But the question for FB stock is what the appar worsen state of ad tech mean go forward.Ar Grow Ad Tech Concern a Plu or Minu for Facebook Stock?Th core concern regard not just fraud, but poor measur of onlin advertis impress and click-throughs, is that advertis can't accur gaug ROI. Facebook' recent measur error - includ inflat video durat figur for more than two year - seem of a piec with that concern.Ther are other issu with the Facebook platform, too, includ fake accounts, for instance. In the file ahead of the Facebook IPO, the compani estim that 8.7% of account were fake. That figur wa later updat to a rang of 5%-11%. Click farm lead to paid promot for user that aren't real potenti customers. The same issu that plagu onlin advertis more gener seem to pop up for advertis on Facebook as well.But, there' an argument that the problem in onlin advertis could repres anoth growth driver for Facebook stock. The company' close ecosystem elimin mani of the middlemen that are alleg to caus the disrupt in programmat marketplaces. While there are fraud problems, manag continu to aggress work to resolv those problems.Facebook' long-term growth potenti - which, in the end, will drive FB stock - is base on happi customers. But keep happi custom mean Facebook must fix ani potenti fraud problem as quickli and aggress as possible.Facebook is do just that. Manag announc last week that it would submit to third-parti audit by the non-profit Media Rate Council. Twenty-four third-parti compani now have access to the platform to improv measurement. FB is provid more data, and more option for buy as well.Whi Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holder Shouldn't Sweat SnapchatIf the concern about onlin advertis are accur - and there' an aw lot of evid at thi point - Facebook seem better-posit than it rivals, should advertis pull back. Rather, Criteo, Rocket Fuel and evenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) seem far more at risk.In that scenario, actually, Facebook' attract to advertis would onlyincrease. A close platform, improv measur capabl and third-parti verif would offer confid to those advertis not avail elsewher on the Web.And that would be a boon for FB stock.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 3 Best Bear Trade on Wall Street Right Now7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveAppl Inc.

How Twitter Can Fix Itself by Learning from YouTube,2/14/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();When Donald Trump first began gain some momentum in the presidenti race, it look to be pretti fantast news for Twitter (TWTR), and investor in the social network giant too. After all, Trump would frequent go onto the site to announc new plan or fight back against hi detractors. It wa (and continu to be) an incred resourc for polit updates.Now that Trump is President, hi tweet move markets. Hi attack on compani can send share price lower in a heartbeat and are an import thing to consid for investor these days. Some haveset up app to track hi tweetsand how they relat to the market. Other do a tweet analysi in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, includingTh Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker.But beyond Trump, Twitter also manag to becom the singl greatest collect of primari sourc of all-time. When break news happens, it is almost alway report first hand on Twitter, and then it is dissemin out from there.You'd think that these factor alon would make Twitter an unstopp media juggernaut. A must for journalist and those seek to stay up-to-d on the news alike. So how ha Twitter capit on thi incred time and presidenti stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.Bad Earn Report AgainTh compani post yet anoth disappoint quarter for Q4, miss expect on the revenu front and post shockingli poor activ user figures. It remain stuck around the 320 million activ monthli user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenu either. Add in disappoint adjust earn guidance, and it isn't a great situat by ani stretch for TWTR investor these days, especi given that the compani ha a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).And let' remember, these figur are with the leader of the free world liter use the servic to clarifi polici and goal on a regular basis. The environ cannot possibl get ani better for Twitter. It product is in the news on a near hourli basi at thi point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter need a shakeup and it need a bit of a Hail-Mari in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the compani do?Twitt Need to Copi YouTube. Now.Fortun for Twitter, the path to relev and growth is alreadi laid out befor them. The good folk at Alphabet ( GOOGL) ( GOOG) have alreadi done all the hard work in their YouTub divis and Twitter need onli to copi their best practices.First and foremost is capit on the incred miss opportun of get an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the pictur below, there is alway a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Whi not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some peopl are not go to like that, but peopl will adjust accordingly. We saw someth similar with YouTub where at first onli certain video had ads, and now nearli everyth ha an advertis befor the video. Peopl have adapt and it ha becom the norm to see thi befor a video. Peopl will do the same with Twitter (and embed tweets) and thi will help with casual user (much the same way embed help with casual YouTubers).Aft all, these casual user who mostli see tweet embed somewher els make up a huge base of peopl and are arguabl the key to Twitter' success. Find a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTub doesn't need you to be sign in or make video to make revenu off of you-should be paramount in Twitter' near term plans.Accord to Twitter,embed tweet reach more than a billion peopleeach month across the web, a truli massiv figure. And that number is actual from befor Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweet were on the nightli news on a regular basis.But what if peopl hate thi idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easi way to placat peopl will be to pay the content gener for the work they are doing. Give tweeter a slice of the ad revenu that they gener would go a long way to get peopl and small busi to tweet more, and it is pretti much akin to what YouTub doe with their stars. AndTwitt ha even look to do thi on the video side, so whi not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAr some of these idea go to be popular? Definit not. But Twitter need to tri someth in order to jumpstart it flounder share price and lacklust growth. Everyth need to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.Th compani find itself in a truli histor posit and it is an opportun that isn't go to come around everi four years. The confluenc of Trump and the increas desir for real-tim (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the compani ha complet fail to capit on the trend.Tak some of YouTube' best practic might be a good place to start in order to return to relev though. It certainli ha a better shot of reviv the stock than anyth Twitter ha come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back toward growth too.And a posit of growth would make Twitter a much better candid for a takeover, perhap from a compani like Alphabet. Such a partnership make a lot of sens and it would allow better integr between Googl search result and tweets, while the meld of tweet and YouTub comment would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter want to get to thi end-which seem like the best possibl outcom for TWTR investor at thi point-tak a page out of YouTube' book and start think about way to get more ad out there, and how to benefit creator in the process. Becaus if Twitter can't take some risk and find a way to make thing work when their servic is at the forefront of news and popular cultur like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info deliv straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newslett will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-perform ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

It' Friday, Jan. 27, and we'r break them quarterli result from PayPal and Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join in the studio by fool.com tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah, how' it going?Sarah Priestley:It' good, it' a pleasur to be here, thank you for have me.Lewis:Ar you excit for pizza day?Priestley:I am veri excited. It' go to derail my New Year' resolutions, but that' OK. [laughs]Lewis:That' a callback to your episod with the Vincent Shen. Are you find that the Appl Watch is be helpful?Priestley:Yes. It' definit remind me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps, so I just end up walk around my live room like a crazi person.Lewis:I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That' how I get my exercis in.Priestley:That' probabl a good idea, yeah.Lewis:So, Sarah, a ton go on in tech thi week, the next coupl week with earnings. Two pretti follow Fool compani report yesterday after the bell. We dug into the report and are readi to talk about them. You did some of the heavi lift with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Whi don't we talk about PayPal first. How did the result look?Priestley:To give you an overview for the fourth quarter, earn came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Oper revenu wa a littl higher than expect at 21%. Transact were $1.8 billion. But the volum wa below expected. Expect wa $100 billion and they deliv $99.3 billion. And that is whi share price are down about 3.5% thi morning. So, it seem like a slight overreact when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah, that' the reason for the share price falling.Lewis:And that' realli one of the core metric that investor tend to focu on for them as a company, right?Priestley:Absolutely. They realli are measur on engagement, so number of customers, and engag of those customers, and the key metric for those.Lewis:Look beyond some of the top line numbers, what els pop up to you in the report?Priestley:Th oper margin for the fourth quarter wa down to 15.4%. The reason that we'r comment on thi is that that' a lot, it take up a lot of room in the bullish theses, that the new partnership they'v start with a lot of the banks,Visa,Mastercard, they'r go to realli pressur their margin down.Lewis:I the thought there that they'r work with veri big institut and big players, and they just don't have the negoti room that they might with some smaller players?Priestley:Absolutely. That' part of it. And also, it' just the standard transact payment. It' the same thing forSquareand other payment processors; it' a standard transact amount on card processing. So, that 15.4% compar to 16.1% in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that' quit a declin there. Manag ha talk about the fact that they are realli do everyth they can to leverag their other incom against this. And I feel like they'v done a pretti good job. Their CEO, Dan Schulman, ha said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quart margin performance.Lewis:Which is someth we like to hear as Foolish investors.Priestley:That' veri true. And, I would also comment that the manag team is realli be driven for their compens packag on the long-term perform of thi stock, and I think that realli show in their reporting. They'r focus on free cash flow in their projects, and what they'r deliv to their customers. Just to give you a coupl of the year-over-year figures: Earn per share for the year increas 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP wa $1.50 on guidanc of $1.45 to $1.50. That' pretti good. Revenu for the full year wa up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutr basis, and they guid for 19%, so they realli beat that.Lewis:Lik Alphabet, their fiscal Q4 come with the calendar Q4, so we were abl to look at full year result here, and not just the quarterli results. What' go on with total payment volume? I know that' someth that peopl realli like to focu on with them.Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. If we had seen total payment volum less than 25%, I think we would have seen a bigger declin in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter, payment volum wa up 25%. As I said, the actual process amount wa $99.3 billion, which miss the expectations. Interestingly, the major of thi wa push by international. Intern expand 27%. The U.S. wa 23%.Lewis:And for the unacquainted, total payment volum is just the gross amount that they are help to facilitate.Priestley:Yes. The way to look at thi is, the total payment volum is the number of payment that they process. Then, the transact is the amount that they process. So, they'r averag about $56 per transact right now. That' slightli down from $60 that they were averag a coupl quarter ago. But it' still veri good.Lewis:So, for the amount per transact to be down, they must be do more total transact to be make it up in volum and still be see growth, right?Priestley:Yes, you'r exactli right. I will also comment that, of their transact in their Q4, $100 billion wa mobil payments, which is an increas of 55%, and it' almost a third now of their transact processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the manag team ha realli isol that as an opportun for the company. That' where they'r go to realli demonstr their industri leadership. The market is move toward mobile, and they'r realli pioneer in the mobil industry.Lewis:So what can peopl expect look forward, either first quarter of 2017 or further out, broadli in 2017?Priestley:Absolutely. I'll look for 2017 quarter four revenu we'r expect to grow on a currenc neutral basi 16% to 18%. That give you a rang of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That wa actual slightli more conserv than some analyst were expecting, which play into their share price perform today. But full-year perform is strong, revenu growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currenc neutral, which give you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion.Lewis:I there anyth to worri about with some of these number that we'r look at, that manag growth project are differ than what the market is expecting? Because, they are still veri much in growth mode as a business, and I know that earli on, those projections, if they start to deceler at all, can start to scare peopl off a littl bit.Priestley:I think they have been fairli conserv in some of their estimations, becaus they realli do have a huge potenti with the mobil traffic. I think, if you look at some of their project that they'r work on now, Venmo ha increas 100% year over year. It wasTim Magazine'sbest app, it' process $5.6 billion, which wa up 126%. So, I think they have a huge potenti with a lot of the project they'r work on; they'v experienc huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monet yet. And an analyst actual rais the question in the earn call: ""I your project in 2017 build in some of the expect for monet this, and also Xoom?"" which is their intern money transfer program. They dismiss this. They said it wa push out to 2018, some of the opportunities, and that they will be focus on growth. So, I think, for 2017, these might be conserv estimates. But for 2018, we might actual start to see the fruit of that labor.Lewis:Yeah, and you said, 55% of what wa be processed, broadli for the business, wa come from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically, that is almost entir mobile. It' more peer-to-peer. There are some question about whether or not they will be abl to monet that veri well, and what that might look like, becaus me give you $5 becaus you bought me lunch the other day, they don't realli take anyth on that.Priestley:No, they don't. And someth to say is, it' becom a huge crowd market. I think PayPal, to some degree, ha a first-mov advantage, but they'r definit not the biggest player in thi industry. The bank have gotten togeth and creat clearXchange, which is a peer-to-p payment which is also free right now. It' own by the banks, so it ha a lot of clout. Whether or not peopl pick it up to the rate that they'v pick up Venmo, which is huge popular with millennials, a lot of our friend use it all the time, we use it. Also,Apple. Appl ha grown hugely. Tim Cook in hi last earn call -- so, thi is a bit outdat -- said that 75% of swipe transact were from Appl Pay.Lewis:Wow. It' hard to believe. Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends, and mayb you can lend some color on thi too, if someon cover the tab, I'm pay them via Venmo. No one is ever like, ""Do you haveBank of Americamobil payment processing?"" So, they do seem to have that first-mov advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge instal base, as they do, it realli come down to whether they can flip the monet switch on. I guess investor are go to have to be patient on that, if manag is push that out to 2018.Priestley:Absolutely. I will say, they do have a lot of initi that are pan out for them right now. One Touch basic enabl you to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal, and you can just click one button at the checkout and it' transact through PayPal, which is huge benefici for mobile. I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm look at shoe online, as soon as I get to the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small box and put your card number in, they lose me. I think it' someth like a 74% cart-abandon rate on mobile.Lewis:So when peopl reach that checkout phase and they see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their secur code, their address, ship address, zip code, all that stuff, they wind up ditch it?Priestley:Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch, they have 87% convers rate on mobile. That' incredible. They'v had a lot of peopl start to use that. They have ad a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launch thi last year. So there' a huge potenti here for them to realli deliv on their promise. They'v said they want to make customers' live easier, and they'r do that, absolutely.Lewis:Anyth els that manag provid color on with the business, and strateg where they'r looking, that investor should know?Priestley:I think the focu is absolut on mobile. Dan Schulman ha definit comment on the fact that mobil is the biggest opportun for them, and there are a lot of industri tailwind that they'r experienc right now. And I would complet agree. I think Black Friday thi year wa the biggest onlin shop day in history. In quarter three last year -- we'r still wait for quarter four -- the Censu Bureau said that onlin retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are posit themselv well to benefit from this, it should be a rise tide that lift all boats.Lewis:I know they'v talk a littl bit in the past about continu to be an asset-light business. Is that someth that manag recommit to in the most recent call?Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. Thi is someth that analyst have been focus on. I definit notic a coupl of question about thi in the earn call. Squar offer capital, it offer loans, as part of it services. It' not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a servic similar to the compani Square, which deal mostli with small businesses, but obvious thi is individuals, PayPal ha access to a lot of people' inform and their spend habit and how much money they have. So they want to realli leverag that information, and offer it out to partner to facilit the loan use their information, which take the risk away from PayPal, but they'r still gener a percentag of incom from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman comment that it' a realli competit environ for this. I think the payment space is just get more and more competitive, everi angl of it. But overall, I think thi is definit a good move for the company. It' the right decision, it' go to elimin some risk. But it' also potenti go to bring in a degre of revenu too, if they can grow that segment.Lewis:So, it seem like the gener takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company' mobil initiatives. The core busi seem to be hum along. There wa a littl bit of disappointment, but noth thesis-altering, noth crazi in the report.Priestley:No, absolut not. And they didn't touch too much on some of their partners. They'v had some realli high-profil partnership withAlibaba,Vodafonein the U.K. and Europe, and mani others;Discover, that they recent announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't realli give investor a good flavor for how that' going, onli that it' in line with their expectations. So, yeah, I agre with what you said. I think mobil is go to be a big area of focus, we'll continu to have a look at those transact volum and custom engagement.Lewis:So Sarah, I said that you did the heavi lift on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet' earnings. I'm go to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show.Priestley:It' realli nice to not be in the hot seat. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah. I'll stop fire question at you. It' my turn.Priestley:So, yeah, Alphabet report the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results?Lewis:Overall, Alphabet' revenu came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estim of $25.3 billion. Earn per share came in at $7.56, slightli lower than analysts' project of $7.63 per share. I think the real stori -- and what caus some of the immedi reaction for the stock -- wa that adjust profit miss by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versu expect of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock wa down about 2.5% to 3%. That' what most of the market seem to realli fixat on.Priestley:And what wa the caus of that?Lewis:Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effect tax rate of 22%. They also highlight their broad 2016 tax rate, becaus they'r abl to report whole fiscal year result as well. The company' effect tax rate for the year wa 19%. That' a big bump. And you realiz that averag is also incorpor other quarters. You can get a sens of how much more they were pay out in tax thi quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty, MarketWatch writer Jeremi Owen doe a realli good job break down the specifics, but the gist of the issu is, the Financi Account Standard Board issu some chang a while back, basic impact how compani can treat stock-bas compens for their adjust earn numbers. And that wound up impact result for thi quarter. Move forward, the compani will no longer be exclud stock-bas compens expens from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth thing out. But they wound up deal with a littl bit of a hiccup thi quarter to reconcile.Priestley:Yeah, that' realli unusual, the chang for GAAP there.Lewis:Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP number as be someth where the Financi Account Standard Board give peopl a decent amount of latitud to oper how they want to. But they like to rein thing in everi now and then, specif with stock-bas compens becaus it' someth that a lot of firm use to make their non-GAAP number look quit a bit better than their GAAP numbers, especi in the tech space. Look at a coupl of the differ segments, their Googl segment, which is search, ads, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, pretti much anyth that fall under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So, look at a compani with $26 billion in quarterli revenue, that' the meat of it right there. That is gener perform pretti well. Their Googl Site segment, which is the major of that, wa up 20% year over year. Network revenu up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion a littl bit less relat to the internet properti within that segment -- think Hardware, Googl Play, and their cloud segment -- wa $3.4 billion, which wa up 62% year over year. So, that' a veri fast-grow segment within Sundar Pichai' Googl area of the business.I think, if you'r look for indic for them, the two big one that tell the stori for the ad busi and what' go on with some of the internet properties: Aggreg paid clicks, which is basic the number of time that peopl are interact with ad online, wa up 36% year over year. Aggreg cost per click, or CPCs, as they'r commonli known, wa down 15% year over year. Thi is not realli a surprise. Thi is a stori that' been play out for a long time. We talk about the shift to mobil when we were talk about PayPal. The same thing is happen with internet search. CPC have been driven down becaus the effect of mobil ad isn't necessarili quit the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Googl ha been abl to make it up on volume. There' actual quit a parallel there with what happen with PayPal and the volum make up for the smaller transactions. We'r see the same effect here with Alphabet.Priestley:Would you suggest that' someth that investor should includ in their thesi go forward?Lewis:I think it' someth that, at thi point, we shouldn't be too surpris by. Thi stori ha been play out for a decent amount of time. If it realli accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been veri good at make the volum make it work out. Eventually, mobil will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we'r still in that transit to mobile, I think we'r go to continu to see thi for a while, unfortunately.Priestley:OK. What about the Other Bet segment? I know there have been some interest move thi year.Lewis:Yeah, thi is someth that peopl love to ask about, becaus it' like, ""Where is Googl wast all of thi money?"" As a reminder, thi is basic all the stuff they do that isn't tie to their internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financi contributor for thi segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to focu on a full-year breakout for the segment becaus the number are so small rel to the overal business. But revenu came in at $809 million for 2016, which wa up 82% year over year. Oper loss not includ stock-bas compens wa $2.9 billion, down slightli year over year. But, thi segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will continu to be. They have rein in cost a littl bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she ha forc all of the Other Bet initi to at least be abl to show a path to monetization, or a road map to what that might look like. But I think there' a certain test-and-innov atmospher that they want to maintain. And investor have been OK with that, becaus their core internet busi just print money for them.Someth that is interest with them and the Other Bet segment is, they spun out Waymo, which is their autonom drive segment. For the longest time, that wa the Googl Self-Driv Car Project. A coupl month ago, they said, ""Thi is a stand-alon busi unit, and it will be nest within the Alphabet hold structure. It will continu to be in Other Bets."" And we didn't get ani financi insight into what' go on with that. But they talk about it in the call. Ruth Porat provid some commentari on what they'r basic do with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continu to be do with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there, but thi is someth that Daniel Spark and I talk about in a podcast when they announc that a few month ago. As we, in the next coupl quarters, over the next year, continu to get more inform about Waymo, I think we can look at that specif busi segment and see the path for what' go to be go on for some of the Other Bet as they continu to matur and eventu see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bet stuff, but at least we have someth that we can start to track for what the company' ambit might be.Priestley:Absolutely. It look like they'r move forward with that. Wa there anyth els in the number that stood out to you in the earn call?Lewis:I think some of the thing that peopl need to keep in mind with thi report, becaus the stock wa down after hours, I think as of tape thi morning, they were down 40 or 50 basi points, so not a crazi reaction like 3% that we saw after hour yesterday, but still down, I think peopl might be scratch their head a littl bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report, the compani wa trade at all-tim highs. It' trade up for a while. I think it' somewher in the teen in the last year or so. So, there' that. And also, Alphabet doe not provid detail quarterli guidance. Most compani do offer up that guidance, and analyst creat their own model base on those numbers, those line items, and they have their put and take to tweak it slightly. But becaus Alphabet doesn't give those baselin expectations, the likelihood of actual number be differ than analyst expect is slightli higher than it would be for other companies. So, the market' reaction is always, I think, gener go to be a littl bit sharper than what we might see for a compani that doe offer standard guidance.Priestley:Yeah, becaus they have noth readi to peg their estim to.Lewis:Yeah. They have the gener trend of thing and what they can glean from commentary. But veri often, you'll see analysts' expect more or less mirror guidanc with slight adjustments. Not have that as a crutch can just add some unpredict to things. I think that' the way you have to think about it.Priestley:Ani other littl gems?Lewis:Outsid of the numbers, someth that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and realli underscor the import of read compani confer calls, and not just reli on the number that you see report and the quick earn take you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from RBC Capit Marketsin the Q&A section of the call ask thi realli great question, and I think it point to a loom risk for Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, ""It look to me like Googl devic are be outsold 10 to 1 or someth like that in most homes. It' immateri now, but you could see you in five year there' a new voic search interact interfac and it' not Googl in the home. That could be a real challeng for the company."" And he wa basic positing, ""What are you guy do about all of the virtual-assist and smart-hom devices?""Priestley:Yeah, great question.Lewis:Yeah. And Sundar Pichai, Googl CEO, he gave that gener posit answer, talk about the invest the compani is make and how they'r work toward voic search, and how they'r tri to meet consum in everi situat that they might be use voic search, whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at it core, Mahaney' question is get at thi idea of: Amazon' Echo devic are sell like hotcakes. If the instal base for them, or realli ani other virtual assistant, get massive, and consum start use those devic for the type of thing and the purpos that peopl are gener use Googl mobil and desktop search for, what doe that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with ani of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder, I realli love the company. But I think he make a good point. Earlier thi month, actually, at an ad industri conference, there wa anAmazonVP talk about some of the capabl and some of the opportun that Amazon might explore. That led some analyst to specul that the compani might be interest in explor paid search with it Alexa product. Thi is not someth that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years, we need to keep an eye on how peopl are use search, and how peopl are use home assist or virtual assistants. Because, if we see that slowli eat into what would otherwis be desktop or mobil search, you have to wonder about how that might impact Google' core business, and realli what print money for them and allow them to fund all of these other projects.Priestley:Yeah. And also, which product they'r using. If everybodi start adopt the Googl Nest, then they'r good.Lewis:Yeah. If peopl are use Nest or Googl Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem, that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are use product that don't lean on Googl search, and you have platform that are abl to monet that search, Googl might get crowd out a littl bit. Again, Googl did $26 billion in revenu thi quarter. The vast major of that wa onlin ads. It' a huge market. I think people' more in-depth searching, or more research-bas stuff, is alway go to be on desktop or mobile. You can onli glean so much from audio. But if you want the quick answer on someth -- say you want to know who wa the fifth presid of the Unit State -- you can find that out with a voic search, and not realli have to worri about be on mobil or desktop. And that' less impress for Googl Ad Search. So, it' someth to keep in mind. Again, thi is a five, 10-year risk. But, just, investors, keep an eye on what' go on with the virtual assist market, becaus it' someth that could impact Alphabet down the road.Priestley:That' realli interesting. I will hand the baton back to you. [laughs]Lewis:Oh, you'r go to let me wrap up? That' so magnanim of you.Well, listeners, that doe it for thi episod ofIndustri Focus.

Price fell to a level where Appl share were a slam-dunk buy base on income, cash and stock price.Compar thi with ani long trade I'v done on TSLA stock. My thesi ha never been about valuation. Around $200 per share, I sold put in Tesla expect that buyer would step in to support the stock. At $225 and $255 per share, I wrote about go long base on pure technic breakouts.Just last week, I wrote about theopportun to profit from TSLA stock even if it stalled. Over $3 in profit came fast. So I need to roll out of those profit and find anoth place where risk is less obvious.Mi portfolio almost alway ha a small portion reserv to specul trades. As I close my spec trade on Tesla stock, I want to roll the risk into a bet on TWTR shares.5 Incom Tax Deduct You Can't Afford to MissWhi Twitter? Especi when I'v been so vocal about their management' incompetence?Last week, Wall Street neg react to Twitter' earn report in a violent manner. TWTR stock fell 15% in a matter of hours. But what got my attent more so than Twitter fall off the cliff wa the high number of downgrad to ""sell"" from the analysts. Thi sound like capitul in coverage, where almost everyon gave up on the idea of higher price soon. If I am correct, then thi greatli reduc the number of increment sellers.Thi would also give me level against which I can sell risk.How to Trade TWTR Stock HereTh first bet:Sel the TWTR Jan 2018 $13 put for $1.40 per contract to open. By sell nake puts, I am commit to own Twitter stock at $13 per share if it fall beneath it. My breakeven point would be $11.60 per share, and anyth below it would then accru loss for me. Thi trade ha a 15% buffer from current price and a 70% theoret chanc of success.TWTR stock would have to repeat the drop from last week and set a new all-tim low for me to start lose money. Nevertheless, I could modifi thi trade to be a credit put spread, therebi greatli reduc the worst-cas scenario.Th altern bet:Sel the TWTR Jan 2018 $13/$10 credit put spread, but for onli 85 cent per contract. That said, in thi structure, my max risk is defin to the width of the spread less what I collect to open the trade.Both trade have the same odd of success.Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bull NowSomeon who is optimist about a buyout could use some of the premium to buy calls, but thi is not for me. While I do believ that there could be support here, I have zero faith that TWTR manag could pull off a miracle.I am not requir to hold these trade open through expiration.

Mr. McDonald-Smith is a fairli larg man of Jamaican descent, speak fluent Spanish due to a coupl of year live in the Dominican Republic, and is, as they say in England, quit fit. You know the type, someon with arm the size of their head where even an extra-larg shirt is in constant danger of pop it buttons? Mr. McDonald-Smith can honestli boast that he ha never been beaten in arm-wrestling. Thi feat is not overli surpris when look at him, but how is it possibl that one can have a100%success rate in anything? Surely, there is alway someon stronger, or more skilled, and even if there were no such person; doesn't everybodi just have a bad day onc in a while? In fact, Mr. McDonald-Smith is not an undef arm-wrestl becaus he is the strongest man in the world, nor is he undef becaus he is the world' most skill practition of the sport. No, the fact is that Mr. McDonald-Smith is undef due to a veri simpl strategi that is design to help him be successful.What is hi secret? It is quit simple.H never engag in a match with anybodi that he isn't absolut certain he can beat.In such a manner, he can honestli say he ha never been outmatched. He never has, and so long as he continu in hi strategy, he never will be. As he grow older, he will undoubtedli accept fewer and fewer challeng until one day he will retir complet from thi activity, undef and triumphant. Whi is thi important? Well, Mr. McDonald-Smith ha an edg in arm-wrestling. He is larg of stature. He is strong. He is fit. He is smart. And he manag hi ego. Taken as a percentage, the probabl of encount a formid oppon are quit small. On the rare occas that he meet such an opponent, Mr. McDonald-Smith gracious declin the match.Now, here' the key to the strategy: It wouldn't work in a formal arm-wrestl tournament where one wa forc to take on everi oppon place in front of him.In fact, it may be quit useless. While Mr. McDonald-Smith is like to do quit well in a tournament, and he may even advanc to the later rounds, he is unlik to win simpli becaus there is alway someon stronger, or who ha train longer and more diligently. Luckili for Mr. McDonald-Smith, he needn't ever enter such a tournament. There is no reason to outsid of ego.What is the point? Don't play if (and when) you can't win.Exampl of Util One' EdgeNow for some real-world exampl to illustr the valu of invest in what you know, and use one' individu knowledg and skill to avoid lose money, and to achiev out-siz invest returns.

Becaus of our experi with account for incom tax provis in our day job, we were abl to quickli identifi and interpret these signal despit work fairli hectic schedules, and after a review of the rest of the financi statement and the companies' busi operations, market positioning, management, and outlook, were abl to open an invest in a fairli time manner, which turn out to be key, as the share appreci substanti post purchase.VonageStock High: $7.88 (01/13/2017)Recent Price: $6.88 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $2.31; $1.71; $2.25 (01/24/2012; 5/25/12; 4/2/12)Vonag Hold Corp.i an exampl of how experi in financi statement preparation, specif the account for incom tax can lead one to a compel invest thesis.VG is a voice-ov IP ((VOIP)) commun compani (i.e. an Internet-bas telephon provider) with catchi televis advertis spot featur either someon on the beach get hit in the head with a fli box with the Vonag brand on it, or with variou person declar their independ from land line by state ""thi is my last phone bill"" and then crumpl it up and toss it into a massiv pile in the middl of a warehouse, suggest that everyon is do it. It wa a trendi IPO that promptli plummet and lost 80% of it market value. Having, for year dure college, use AOL' (AOL) dial-up Internet CD that came free in the mail to access the Internet, we appreci how the bargain basement telephon servic that Vonag provid could be attract to low-incom users, particularli those with non-resid famili and friends. Have also been an earli fan of Google' (GOOG) (GOOGL) Gmail chat and call featur (now call Hangouts), we and our work colleagu were alreadi adopt of the technology. We recogn that, much like AOL' dial-up CD had previously, land-bas telephon line were fast go obsolete. The Compani had paid down approxim $130M in debt, bring it leverag to about 0.5x net income, and reduc it interest expens year over year by 2/3. The Compani had a fairli clean balanc sheet, stabl revenue, new app and oversea partnerships, so good news on the horizon. Add to that a swing to signific profitability, and the Compani wa trade at a PE of less than 5x and an EV/EBITDA of 3-4x. The Compani look cheap on those metric alone, and there were no sign that busi would deterior ani time soon.So where did our edg come in? What drew our attent to Vonag wa the publish effect tax rate ((ETR)). For calendar 2011 the ETR wa a -375%, as in abenefit(anoth word for a tax gain, the recognit of which actual increas net incom rather than decreas it) and not an expense. Now, in some situations, ETR can be misleading, particularli when compani are oper near break-even, but Vonag wa profit in 2011 with pre-tax earn of $86.3M. It pay to take a look at the footnot and tax rate reconcili in such situat to see what is drive the tax benefit.W reproduc the Company' tax rate reconcili below from it 2011 Form 10-K:[v]Here we see that it wa the releas of a valuat allow ((VA)) on the defer tax asset (DTAs) that wa drive the tax benefit (A valuat allow is a fanci way of say that an asset can't be recogn becaus it is uncertain if it will ever provid a benefit to the Company). By remov a VA, the Compani is send a signal that the benefit of the asset will be recognized, and the independ auditor must agre that such a posit is reasonable. The next step then is to determin what defer tax asset the Compani is now benefit from.Again from the 2011 Form 10-K:""Our net defer tax asset primarili consist of net oper loss carri forward (""NOLs""). We are requir to record a valuat allow against our net defer tax asset if we conclud that it is more like than not that taxabl incom gener in the futur will be insuffici to util the futur incom tax benefit from our net defer tax asset (namely, the NOLs), prior to expiration. We period review thi conclusion, which requir signific manag judgment. Until the fourth quarter of 2011, we record a valuat allow fulli against our net defer tax assets.In 2011, we complet our first full year of taxabl incom and complet our budgetari process for period subsequ to 2011, which anticip continu taxabl incom in the future.""[vi](Emphasisadded)To interject some commentari here, what thi mean is that, by the fourth quarter of 2011, the Compani had not onli just demonstr a pattern of profitability, but it wa project profit in the futureat leastsuffici to recogn the NOL as DTA without an offset VA. So now we know the Compani expect to continu it pattern ofsignificantprofitability, and will larg be abl to avoid pay tax dure the lifetim of the NOLs. But what exactli doe that mean? Let' continue, and rememb that the below number are shown in thousand (000s), so for example, $300,000 is realli $300million.""Bas upon these factor and our sustain profit oper perform over the past three year exclud certain loss associ with our prior convert note and our Decemb 2010 debt refinancing, our evalu determin that the benefit result from our net defer tax asset (namely, the NOLs),ar like to be realiz prior to their expiration. Accordingly, we releas the relat valuat allow against our Unit State feder and Canada net defer tax assets, anda portionof the allow against our state net defer taxassetsa certain NOL may expir prior to util due to shorter util period in certain states, result in a one-tim non-cash incom tax benefit of $325,601 and a correspond net defer tax asset of $325,601 in the fourth quarter of 2011.""[vii](Emphasisadded)Account and attorney love use run-on sentences. The $325Mbenefitthey are talk about recogn now that they are remov the VA is not how much incom the NOL are expect to offset, rather, it is thetax effected(think cash tax save impact) amount of U.S./Canada tax that will not have to be paid in the future. Thegrossamount of incom the NOL can offset is shown below:""A of Decemb 31, 2011, we had NOL for Unit State feder and state tax purpos of $794,714 and $423,963, respectively…""[viii]On can see thi activ occur on both the balanc sheet and the incom statement. A quick review of the NOL expir schedul in the tax footnot provid addit insight into theminimumproject profit of the Compani over the next 18 years.So what did our quick check of the footnot in the SEC file yield? Not insignificantly, we discov that the $326M taxbenefitin calendar 2011 wa due to the releas of a valuat allow on $885M of Feder net oper loss (NOLs) book as an asset on the balanc sheet. What thi means, in essence, is that the Compani wa not onli demonstr an impress return to profit in the prior year (2011), but that it also had signific expect of profit into the forese future. Gener speaking, independ auditor are reluct to sign off on such a larg tax benefit/VA releas without compel incom project and a solid histori of recent earn that are more than suffici to offset the NOLs. We have seen except to thi of course, but provid the auditor is reputable, those except are few and far between.Bottom line; all els be equal, when a compani with a $400M market capit and enterpris valu recogn a $326M GAAP gain due to the more-likely-than-not expect ofat least$885M of taxabl incom over the come years, and then add to that the PE and EV/EBITDA under 5x and veri littl leverage, it' a good bet that compani is worth a whole lot more than the current $2/share.It also may provid a competit advantag over new market entrant that must pay tax over the come decade.Th cash that would otherwis go to pay tax may be use to amort debt, invest in the business, repurchas shares, pay a dividend, or ani number of activ manag may think of to creat valu and increas earn further.With the Company' stock trade around $2 per share, and arm with the confid provid by our edg in financi statement analysi (with particular focu on the incom tax provision), and further arm with a suffici understand of the busi in which it operates, we felt safe enter a position. The result were satisfactory, as illustr in the share price chart below. Although the share dip not insignificantli immedi after our purchase, we took the opportun to increas our posit (remember, we could act with confid becaus we understood what we owned, and what the Compani and the auditor believ the futur held). The share doubl within the year, and have trend upward since.LessonsWhen a company' share are trade at an aggreg market capit of under $400M, is not heavili levered, and then that same compani recogn over $100M of annual EBITDA, $86M of pre-tax income, and on top of all that, book a $326M defer tax asset for NOLs, that is a good sign that not onli is the compani expect to earn incom equival to the gross underli NOL prior to expiration, but also coupl with a clean balanc sheet and suffici cash that the compani is worth look at more closely.Spectrum Brand Hold wa in mani way the opposit of Vonage, but our attent wa attract for much the same reasons.Spectrum Brand HoldingsRec Price: $132.76 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $25.07 (10/19/11)""Decis to buy and sell stock should be base sole on the invest merits"" - Joel GreenblattSpectrum Brand Hold own a number of household brand names, includ Rayovac Batteries, Black & Decker, Russel Hobbs, Black Flag, Georg Foreman Grills, Spectracide, Cutter, Repel, Armor All, STP, etc. SPB' debt-financed, acquisit spree in the 2000 result in a bankruptci file that wipe out sharehold in 2009. One can read more about the Company' backgroundhere.[ix]Th Compani wa still recov the follow two years, when in 2011 we notic the effect tax rate. We onli even saw that as we were look up Prestig Brand Hold (NYSE:PBH) and mistyp the ticker symbol. Incidentally, we end up enter posit in both compani (better lucki than good).""Our effect tax rate on incom from continu oper is approxim 24% and 249% for the Fiscal 2011 Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Nine Months, respectively.""[x]Th impact to the tax rate reconcili for the quarter wa even more pronounced, in the event that a 249% effect tax rate wasn't enough to rais eyebrows.Thus, wherea Vonag had recogn a larg taxbenefitdu to theliftingof a valuat allowance, Spectrum wa recogn a larg taxexpense.Thi is generallynotgood. The question of cours wa why? Were earn deteriorating? Wa it mere do to a chang in control? Were there not suffici incom project go forward to offset NOLs? Read further we got more information:""At Juli 3, 2011, we are estim that at Septemb 30, 2011 we will have U.S. feder and state net oper loss carryforward of approxim $1,156 million and $1,006 million, respectively, which will expir through year end in 2032, and we will have foreign net oper loss carryforward of approxim $143 million, which will expir begin in 2011. Certain of the foreign net oper loss have indefinit carryforward periods. As mention above, limit appli to a substanti portion of the U.S. feder and state net oper loss carryforward in accord with IRC Section 382. As such, we estim that approxim $299 million of our feder and $463 million of our state net oper loss will expir unused.""[xi]That last bit about the §382 limit realli just say that due to one or more chang in control (i.e. ownership transfer of more than 5% of the company, which will gener occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptci reorganization) that there is a limit to how much of the NOL may be use in ani given year, irrespect of profitability. For example, if the Compani were to earn $1.2B in fiscal 2011 (implaus we know, but we are make an illustration), Spectrum would belimitedto how much of the NOL could be use to offset that income, and so on, and so forth until the NOL expired.""Th ultim realiz of our defer tax asset depend on our abil to gener suffici taxabl incom of the appropri charact in the futur and in the appropri tax jurisdictions.W establish valuat allow for defer tax asset when we estim it is more like than not that the tax asset will not be realized.W base these estim on project of futur income, includ tax plan strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Chang in industri condit and other econom condit may impact our abil to project futur income. ASC 740 requir the establish of a valuat allow when it is more like than not that some portion or all of the defer tax asset will not be realized. In accord with ASC 740, we period assess the likelihood that our defer tax asset will be realiz and determin if adjust to the valuat allow are appropriate.A a result of thi assessment, we determin that a full valuat allow is requir against the tax benefit of our net defer tax asset in the U.S., exclud certain indefinit live intangibles. In addition, certain other subsidiari are subject to valuat allow with respect to certain defer tax assets. Dure the Fiscal 2011 Quarter we decreas our valuat allow against net defer tax asset by approxim $30 million. Our total valuat allowance, establish for the tax benefit of defer tax asset that may not be realized, wa approxim $350 million and $331 million at Juli 3, 2011 and Septemb 30, 2010, respectively. Of thi amount, approxim $339 million and $300 million relat to U.S. net defer tax asset at Juli 3, 2011 and Septemb 30, 2010, respect and approxim $11 million and $31 million relat to foreign net defer tax asset at Juli 3, 2011 and Septemb 30, 2010, respectively.""[xii](Emphasisadded)Th Company' footnot for fiscal 2010[xiii]rev somewhat more detail on the NOL and their expirations.Therefore, in contrast with Vonage, Spectrum did not anticip be abl to util it NOL prior to expiration, due both to §382 limit and/or insuffici taxabl incom against which to offset the NOLs. In addition, the Compani wa still fairli lever with $1.7B of long-term debt[xiv]on it balanc sheet.So whi were we interested? Well, we like the asset and brands, which were consum good with respectable, durabl competit advantages. Although not alway the market leader (e.g. Rayovac wa compet fierc with Energ and Duracel on the platform of ""equal or better valu at a lower cost""), the valu proposit and barrier to entri were considerable. In addition, due to the heavi debt load which requir about $200M of annual interest payments[xv]p year, the incom tax provis wa skew the effect tax rate; therefore, net incom (and henc the PE ratio) were, if not entir worthless, not necessarili reflect of the Company' cash gener capabilities, nor the valu of the entir business.""Compani that spend money like drunken sailors, especi on acquisit and real estate, are left with a huge depreci allow and a lot of debt to pay off, which give them a high cash flow/low earn profile.""[xvi]Th truth wa the Compani had signific oper income[xvii]and wa throw off signific amount of cash befor interest payment and debt amortization.[xviii]Th ETR attract our attention, but upon closer inspection, we becam comfort with the Company' valu strategy, it place in the market, the growth in it earn and cash flow, it abil to servic and amort it debt, and the defens of it business. All thing considered, we initi a posit and determin to watch the year-end results[xix]closely.SPB wa trade in the $25 rang prior to our entry. SPB ha subsequ trade up to north of $130 per share. In thi case, the ETR mere attract our attent to a compel invest possibl so we could studi it further. It wa a coupl month later when the Form 10-K came out that we believ we had someth realli special. The Compani had reduc it long-term debt by $180M from $1.72B to $1.54B[xx]and net cash provid by oper activ wa $227M.[xxi]It seem clear to us that the Compani could servic it debt load, and worst-cas scenario could sell off one or more brand to de-lev further, but we didn't expect that would be necessary.Furth research into SPB prior to the share take off similarli reveal an interest arbitrag opportun via the share ofHarbing Capit Group(NYSE:HRG), where one could take advantag of the valu gap in SPB at the same time as one could take advantag in the valu gap in HRG.

The indict had the result of temporarili depress the share of HRG, in our view, understandably, but excess given the natur of hold and oper in HRG.

The Dow had recov from a low of around 6,000 to 11,000-12,000, and despit not yet recov it pre-Great Recess level of 14,000, mani prognost and valu investor were opin that the bull market wa run out of ga and that valu were few and far between. In August and Septemb of 2011, just a few month earlier, the market experienc a slight correction. By invest in what we understood, we were abl to find all kind of bargainsafterour initi purchas dure the Great Recess had significantli appreciated, and thi wa dure a period of time when mani were fret the direct of the market and that there were few if ani compel valu available. In our own wheelhouse, we were nearli trip over them in late 2011 and earli 2012.If that Didn't Convinc You…In 1994, Mr. Peter Lynch of Fidel Magellan fame said the follow aboutedgesdur a lectur at the Nation Press Club. We are reproduc sever paragraph to drive the point home:""Y need an edg to make money, too. Peopl have incred edg and they throw them away.I'l give you a quick exampl of, uh, Smith-Kline. Thi is a stock that had Tagamet. Now you didn't have to buy Smith-Klin when Tagamet wa do clinic trials. You didn't have to buy Smith-Klin when Tagamet wa talk about in the New England Journal of Medicine, or the British version, Lancet. You could have bought Smith-Klin a year after Tagamet came out.Let' say your spouse, your mother, your father, your nurse, your druggist. You'r write all these prescriptions. Tagamet wa do an amaz job cure ulcers. And it wa a wonder pill for the compani becaus if you stop take it, the ulcer came back. It wasn't a crummi product if you took it for a buck and then it went away. But it wa a great product for the company. But you could have bought it two year after the product wa on the market and made five-to-six time your money. I mean all the druggists, all the nurses, all the people, I mean million of peopl saw thi product. And they'r out buy oil compani or drill rigs. It happens.And then three year later or four year later, Glaxo, even a bigger company, thi is a huge company, a British company, brought out Zantac which wa a better, at that time an improv product, and you could have seen that take market share, do well, and you could have bought Glaxo and tripl your money.So you onli need a few stock in your lifetime. They'r in your industry.I think of people, if you'd work in the auto industry, let' say you'r an auto dealer, the last ten years. You would have seen Chrysler come out with the mini-van. If you were a Buick dealer, a Toyota dealer, a Honda dealer… You would have seen Chrysler dealership pack with people. You could have made ten time your money on Chrysler a year after the minivan came out. Ford introduc the Tauru Sable, the most except line of car in the last twenti years. Ford went up seven-fold on the Tauru Sable. So if you'r a car dealer, you onli need to buy a few stock everi decade.When your lifetime' over, you don't need a lot of five-bagg to make a lot of money, start with ten thousand dollar or five thousand dollars.So in your own industri you'r go to see a lot of stocks. And that is what bother me.Ther are good stock out there that are look for you, and peopl just aren't listening. They'r just not watch it. And peopl have incred edges. Peopl have big edg over me.They work in the aluminum industry. They see aluminum inventori come down six straight months. They see demand improving. And in America today it is hard to get an EPA permit for a bowl alley, never mind an aluminum smelter. So you know when aluminum get tight you just can't build seven aluminum smelters. So when you see thi come you can say, wait a second, I can make some money.When an industri goe from terribl to mediocre, the stock goe north. When it goe from mediocr to good, the stock goe north. And when it goe from good to terrif the stock goe north.There' lot of way to make money in your own industry.Y can be a supplier in the industry, you can be a customer. It happen in the paper industry, it happen in the steel industry. It doesn't happen everi week, but if you'r in some field, you'll see a turn, you'll see someth in the publish industry.Thes thing come along and it is just mind boggling, peopl throw it away.""[xxv](Emphasisadded)Th point is that nearli everyon ha an edge. If they choos onli to play their game in which that edg exists, they are more like to come out on top. Of course, one must exercis the disciplin of invest in one' own circl of competence, and then wait for their pitch.ConclusionParticip in the market is like fish in water teem with both fish and sharks. If one just jump in and tri to swim with the sharks, bad thing are like to result. And while we are on the subject of sharks…Th author' spous enjoy watch the CNBC showShark Tank. Last week, she made the comment that ""Mark Cuban is alway 'out'. It ha been a long time sinc he ha made a deal."" Although she like wa frustrat by thi observation, her comment caught our attention. We did a quick googl search for ""Mark Cuban"" and ""investing"" on YouTube, and we found an interview[xxvi]from August 2011. Now, August 2011 wa a month in which, after the market had gain mayb 80% sinc the 2009 great recess lows, the market start gyrat and wa threaten to correct, and profession comment were begin to throw around the word ""recession"" again. A great mani profession money manag believ the market wa fairly, or even overli valued, and fear wa again begin to creep into Wall Street. In thi interview Mr. Cuban said the following:""Ani time there' volatil and ani time there' chang there' opportunity. Now I say it' great becaus I'v taken a whole differ approach to invest than most people.Y know, I think buy and hold is a crock of sh--. I think, you know, the idea that you alway have to invest your cash is not far behind, and so I'v alway been of the attitud that unless you realli have a commit to something, just keep your money in cash, know that at some point in time, there' go to be a week or two like we'v had…""When the interview observ there ha been a lot of ""stuff"" hit the fan lately, Mr. Cuban continues:""Exactli the point. That' where the opportun is. Then when everyth start get crazy, I call it the world seri of investing, you know, that' where you start dig in…You'v got all these profession peopl on the other side of trades.When I start invest in stock in the earli 90' after I sold my first company, you could understand differ element of the market better than the professionals… Today there' so much money in these huge hedg funds, and they have such profession research, and in depth research,ther aren't ani advantag for the individu traders, and so my approach ha alway been,unless I know someth specific, put it in cash.""(Emphasi added)W might take the creativ liberti to amend that last sentenc to replac the word ""any"" with the word ""many,"" but the point is larg the same. Most investor significantli underperform the market over the long run, becaus they invest in thing they do not understand, they tri to time the market, or they becom emot and jump in and out of secur rather than just stay put and let the number of bargain purchas and the extent of the bargain in compani dictat how much of their capit is invested. Finally, they throw their edg away and play Wall Street' game. However, by follow certain invest principl and by take deliber steps, the averag investor can play their own game, on their own terms, and come out ahead.Th successful, self-direct investor must adopt a proven, viabl invest framework, insist on a margin of safety, and onli play the game when the odd are stack in the investor' favor. In other words, the investor must insist upon exploit hi or her edge. If thi result in their be in cash, not when market prognost are preach doom and gloom, and not when their emot are tell them the market is overvalued, but whenthey simpli cannot find compel invest opportun in their own wheelhouse, then hold cash may be the smartest thing one can do. The averageactive, self-directedinvestor should not be worri about have a signific amount of their portfolio in cash. Seth Klarman of Baupost fame ha strung togeth a 30-odd year track record of signific out-performance, and absolut perform in nearli everi year while hold nearli one-half of hi fund in cash, on average. It is veri difficult to lose one' money in cash. By be cautiou and conserv when compel bargain are not prevalent, and then by insist on an edg befor invest that cash in a security, truli amaz result can occur. Thi requir patienc and discipline, but those are concept for separ articles.A Peter Lynch ha written, it onli take a few five-to-ten-bagg to result in an amaz long-term invest record (provid the investor doesn't make too mani stupid mistak in the meanwhile).""It wa huge gain in a few huge posit that led to Magellan' superior results.""[xxvii]- Peter Lynch""I'v said befor that an amateur who devot a small amount of studi to compani in an industri he or she know someth about can outperform 95 percent of the paid expert who manag the mutual funds, plu have fun do it.""[xxviii]- Peter LynchIf one is hell-bent on be fulli invest at all times, one may conceiv invest the balanc of their portfolio in Berkshir Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), just don't go invest in stock in which you do not have an edge, mere becaus compel bargain within your wheelhous are few and far between.

Furthermore, GOOGL stock ha been in ralli mode sinc mid-2015, gain some 53% dure thi time frame.In other words, the post-earn dip wa less about poor quarterli result and more about an excus to take some profit off the table.However, now that the situat ha correct itself, and Alphabet stock ha emerg from an overbought situation, share should be pois to run higher.If you took mybullish GOOGL recommend on Jan. 31and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are like alreadi at breakeven or sit on a profit for the trade. What' more, the odd of break out abov $850 have improv significantli in the past coupl of weeks.9 Top Pharmaceut Stock to Buy for the DividendsAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and enter the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easi now that GOOGL stock is head higher onc again.If you miss out on those trades, though, there' still time to get in befor Alphabet Inc top out again.Senti for Alphabet remain as bullish as ever, with nearli all of the 48 analyst track by Thomson/First Call rate GOOGL stock a ""buy."" Additionally, the 12-month price target ha risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bode well for the share go forward, as it cut down on the likelihood of downgrad to ""hold"" over the short-term.A for option traders, a bit of caution ha crept into GOOGL option sinc Alphabet' quarterli report, but this, too, is healthi for the shares.

And in the case ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), it' what drive it profits, cash flow and ultim the valu of it stock. Googl ha made a name for itself delv into people' lives, run it through an algorithm and sell the output to advertisers. Pretti much everyth GOOGL stock doe -even control your thermostat- ha to do with creat thi huge base of data for the compani to play with.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd it latest, and somewhat secret move are all about get it hand anoth massiv pile of people' lives. Googl is buy flounder social media networkTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Well, not entirely. But GOOGL ha start pick off piec of the Twitter corpse. And by snag some of TWTR' item now, Alphabet could be set itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actual might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investor as it all about the data.GOOGL Snag Develop ToolsTwitt ha been a potenti buyout candid basic the second it IPO'd a few year ago. Perhap even more so now that the social network ha struggl to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock ha plung about 60% sinc it public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just it namesak service. In thi case, it' about app development.For an undisclos sum, Alphabet hasagre to buyout Twitter'smain develop project - Fabric.7 Marvel Mid-Cap Stock to Buy for the Best of All WorldsFabr provid a softwar toolkit for develop and design of mobil apps. And even though it' part of Twitter, it' not small potatoes. The softwar is use by more than 580,000 mobil develop includingAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) andWal-Mart Store Inc's(NYSE:WMT) Jet.com.Fabr will be fold into Google' own Firebas mobil develop platform, and it employe will be now part of Alphabet.So whi would the compani want thi stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it' all about data.With the addit of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tool for develop mobil apps. Fabric is a favorit stomp ground for app develop forAppl Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iO softwar for iPhones/iPads. By have the two under one umbrella, it give Alphabet an easi inroad to help develop make formerli exclus iPhon app avail for the mobil web and Google' Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock make a bulk of it advertis dollars.Th second big data kicker come from the fact that while much of Google' tool are avail for free; mani develop will buy comput power and storag from the company' cloud service. It' expect that onc Fabric is integr fully, the deal would be the same. Not onli doe that boost GOOGL' cloud revenues, but it give it a chanc to comb through all the data be produc and potenti mine it for what it is worth.Backend as a servic (BaaS) platform like Fabric and Firebas fit perfectli into Google' ""Here, have it for free, we'll just keep the data"" busi model.In the end, the purchas will allow Googl to further cement itself as one of the world' biggest mobil app develop and give it a new sourc of addit revenue.Alphabet Still Want BluebirdBut what about Twitter' real function - those juici 140 charact tweet and the social network? Even though Googl didn't make an offer to buy the firm, the truth is, Twitter proper still make for an excel fit for GOOGL stock. Twitter ha a hard time data mine and get advertis to embrac all those tweets. But for someon like Google, the social media network - and it 300 million user - is pure gold. Advertis are start to prefer social media network and their abil to drill down to specif users.How Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Fool the Sucker AgainTh idea behind Twitter sell off thi hobbi busi wa so that it could focu on boost the main product' user base, remov spam/bot and make it a better product. Buy wait to buy it later, all the hard clean-up work will be done. And if it is still floundering, it give Alphabet a chanc to buy it on the cheap. And consid that there will be now plenti of former Twitter employe at GOOGL, integr it later on will be a snap.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockWhil it continu to be a perpetu rumor, Google' latest action suggest that Twitter will veri much be an Alphabet busi in the future. The move to strengthen it one develop base in mobil app and snag key person from the social media compani is just the first step. It give plenti of time for Twitter to refocu and reorganize. In the meantime, the addit revenu from Fabric and cloud sale will be certainli welcome.And when Googl final doe buy TWTR, it'll be great news for GOOGL stock. That' 300 million more user it can mine for data and potenti extract use info for advertisers. Googl is just one step closer to put the rumor to rest and snag the social media company.A of thi writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Super-Saf Dividend Growth Stock to Buy Today7 Tech Stock That Are Buck the DowntrendTh postWhi Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Would Win Big With a Twitter Buyoutappear first onInvestorPlace."

The Amazon Web Servic contract is for ""redund infrastructur support of our busi operations,"" accord to Snap'samend S-1filing.Th new file also reveal Snap ha been use Amazon for nearli a year, so not much will chang in the near term. But the way Snap' contract is structur with Amazon, it could be spend nearli as much on AW five year from now as it is on Googl Cloud.makeArticleAd();It' worth take a closer look at Snap' cloud contracts.

That might chang in five years. While Amazon just provid redund for Snapchat to ensur the app doesn't suffer signific downtim right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That' evid by the ramp in minimum obligations.Googl still ha a big advantag over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google' Cloud Platform. Transit to anoth cloud provid ""would be difficult to implement, and may caus us to incur signific time and expense,"" it said in it S-1. What' more, Snap built Snapchat use the tool avail on Google,"" some of which do not have an altern in the market,"" accord to it prospectus.But if Snap want to expand to China, where Googl doesn't operate, it'll have to rework thing on anoth cloud provider, anyway. Consid the grow size of Snap' cloud spending, Amazon may be abl to offer tool compar to what it use on Googl to help facilit a transition.Google' cloud busi is minuscul in comparison to Amazon's. Snap' $400 million per year contract veri like made it Google' biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon' go to steal away a good chunk of it business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- it cloud busi brought in $12 billion last year -- but it mean a whole lot to Google.What thi mean for SnapSnap is now commit $3 billion to cloud servic over the next five years. That' a lot for a compani with onli $405 million in annual revenue, even one grow as quickli as Snap.At some point, it would make more sens for Snap to build out it own infrastructur like other popular internet services. Build infrastructur is capit intensive, but onc it' built, the compani would no longer be as reliant on third parti to support it flagship app. With Snap lock into contract for the next five years, it' unlik we'll see it go that way anytim soon, which mean continu pressur on it gross margin.Last year, Snap' cost of revenu exceed sales. The bulk of it cost of revenu wa attribut to it cloud infrastructur expenses, which climb $192 million last year. As such, Snap post a neg gross margin, which is crazi for a compani that primarili produc software.Bi 2021, Snap will be pay at least $750 million for cloud services.

5 Things We Learned From The Wall Street Journal's Exclusive Report on SpaceX,2/12/2017,"By now you'v almost certainli heardth big news about SpaceX: Last month,Th Wall Street Journaluncov a treasur trove of intern documentsfrom the company. These document clearli demonstr that SpaceX is neither profit nor cash flow posit ani longer.It' what you maynothav heard, though, that will realli shock you: SpaceX never plan to earn much profit from launch rocket in the first place. Instead, SpaceX is place it faith in a megaproject, partial back byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , to creat a satellit broadband internet constellation, which will encircl the globe, and (a theJournalput it) ""eventu dwarf [SpaceX's] rocket division.""Now, here are five more thing you need to know about SpaceX' secret plan for satellit dominance.makeArticleAd();Look! Up in the sky! It' not a bird or a plane -- it' how SpaceX hope to turn profitable. Imag source: Getti Images.1. Tini satellites, huge profitsWhil most famou today for it rocket launch (and soon to becom famou for launch reus rockets, perhap as soon as thi month), SpaceX see rocket as onli a small part of it plan for futur profits.Accord to intern document date from 2015, SpaceX hope to begin put aconstel of 4,425 broadband internet satellitesinto orbit in 2018, and begin collect revenu from it as an internet servic provid as earli as 2019.2. Move the needleThat year, revenu from satellit will be minuscul -- a few hundr million dollar at most, and probabl contribut noth to profits. Just one year later, however, in 2020, SpaceX expect to get roughli equal amount of revenu from rocket launch and from satellit internet, about $3 billion each. Profit are expect to leap to $2 billion -- 33% of revenue.3. Blast offAnd thi is just the beginning. SpaceX expect it revenu from satellit internet to grow by leap and bound from 2020 on, eclips revenu from rocket launch in 2021. SpaceX expect that by 2022, satellit revenu will account for roughli 75% ofallrevenu the compani collects, then grow to more than 80% in 2023, and to 85% or more in 2024 and 2025 -- by which time SpaceX expect to be regularlyland astronaut on Mars.4. Plan obsolesc for rocket launches?Y might expect that onc SpaceX ha begun it Mar colon project, the compani would lose interest in the workaday busi of mere loft satellit into Earth orbit -- and you'd be right.SpaceX' rocket launch plan got knock off track by it twin SpaceXplos in 2015 and 2016. But befor those plan went askew, the compani had map out a surpris futur for it rocket launch program. Start off from a base of zero launch in 2011, SpaceX plan to steadili increas the pace of launch through 2019. SpaceX had 27 launch slate for thi year, for example. That number would grow to 44 launch in 2018, and then 52 in 2019. But in 2020, satellit launch activ would suddenli revers course, and fall to just 41 launches.At the same time, SpaceX project modest increas in launchrevenueeven after 2020. The logic conclus is that by 2020, what few rocket SpaceX is still launch will be bigger, and more expensive, and will carri bigger, more expens satellites, too -- just not as mani of them.5. A margin explosionSo what doe all of thi mean for SpaceX stock, and for the investor who hope to invest ina possibl eventu SpaceX IPO?A we explain last week, SpaceX' intern document show that even in the best of years, it ha been onli margin profitable, and is not profit at all at present. Introduc reusabl rocket launches, as the compani plan to do thi month, hold the potenti to put SpaceX back in the black. But signific profit -- the kind that can financ the colon of Mar -- will depend on the company' success deploy and oper of a constel of broadband internet satellites.Bas on the number laid out above, SpaceX appear to be target oper profit margin of 33% onc it satellit begin oper in 2020. Oper profit could total $4 billion by 2021 (a profit margin of more than 40% on project revenu of about $9.5 billion). Margin will top 50% by 2022 -- then soar into the mid-50 rang in 2023, and final top out at better than 60% by 2025. At that point, SpaceX expect to be collect $36 billion in annual revenu -- almost all of it from satellit -- and earn roughli $22 billion in oper profit. To put that final goal in context, $22 billion inprof 11 time more than the $1 billion inrevenuethat SpaceX collect in 2014, it best revenu year ever.Log conclusion:IfSpaceX can bring it broadband satellit internet project to fruition, SpaceX stock could turn out to be a veri profit investment. But if you'r plan to invest in SpaceX, you need to do it for the satellit busi (which doesn't exist yet), and not for the rocket launch busi that doe exist.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks Begging for a Buyout,2/11/2017,"Sometim merger are necessari for survival, and at other times, they simpli just make good old-fashion sense. In either case, investor lucki enough to own stock that do get bought out can turn a nice profit.W reach out to our contributors, and ask them to tell us what stock they think could get bought. They settl onTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) ,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) , andMerrimack Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: MACK) . Read on to learn if these compani are worth own in your portfolio.A stock good enough for a presidentRich Smith(Twitter):Rememb how last year, the internet were all a-twitt with rumor thatWalt Disney-- or maybeGoogle, or perhapssalesforce.com-- wa go to buy Twitter? It never actual happened, of course, but I think it might have happen -- and I think it stillshouldhappen.makeArticleAd();IMAG SOURCE: TWITTER.Second onli toFacebookin internet mindshare, Twitter is the stock success stori that never quit made it. Twitter went public more than three year ago at $26 per share, and almost immedi doubl in price befor investor began to notic a ""giant suck sound,"" which ultim pull down Twitter to it current price of $18.50.You can blame Twitter' failur on ani number of things: a lack of profits, single-digit revenu growth, or zero growth in it user base (a of last quarter). At the same time, with 320 million monthli visitor to the site, Twitter remain a forc to be reckon with on the internet, and will onli grow more import as Presid Trump use it as hi social-media trumpet.Oth fan of Twitter may tout it use for keep abreast of celebr news, it deal with sport organizations, or it effort in live-streaming. But for me, the key is this: Today, anyon who want to know what' go on in the White House, and even anyon who want toopposewhat' go on in the White House, need to be on Twitter to stay informed. Thi singl fact make Twitter one of the most import piec of internet real estat out there today; if the company' current owner can't figur out how to make a profit off that, I'm certain there are other internet tycoon who have the ego to believ that they can do better.Soon or later, one of those guy is go to buy Twitter. I'm bet on sooner.Wil a buyout send thi stock flying?Tim Brugger(GoPro):Now that the Karma drone is back, at least in limit quantiti in the U.S. (for now), some pundit have suggest that GoPro' futur reli on consum get back on board now that it battery-latch issu ha been resolved.Unfortunately, it' not quit as simpl as that. As founder and CEO Nichola Woodman note in GoPro' recent announc fourth-quart and 2016 annual results, it HERO5 Black camera wa the best-sel digit ""imag device"" in the country, along with select intern markets, last quarter. And GoPro' mobil efforts, which includ it Quik app, are pick up steam. But the primari concern remains: GoPro simpli doesn't have the product diversif it need to weather an unexpect storm.Woodman warn investor to not expect much in GoPro' fourth quarter, and the reason behind hi tri to mute expect is whi GoPro is beg for a buyout. The problem start with the aforement Karma be recal ahead of the all-import holiday shop season, along with some manufactur hiccups. When one product miscu caus the poor result GoPro announc on Feb. 2, on the heel of an equal disappoint third quarter -- in which it revenu of $540.6 million wa woefulli short of the $574.5 million expect -- it' a scari proposition.However, a buyout by a compani that could add GoPro' camera and drone to an alreadi diversifi product lineup: Nowthatwould make sense. And the time couldn't be better for a suitor, given GoPro' woeful 18% stock-pric declin over the past year.It' unlikely, but it could still happenTodd Campbell(Merrimack Pharmaceuticals):Instead of buy Merrimack Pharmaceut lock, stock, and barrel,Ipsen(NASDAQOTH: IPSEY) bought Merrimack' onli FDA-approv drug. Ipsen' appar unwilling to acquir Merrimack outright cast doubt that ani suitor will emerg for the company, especi now that it' sold it onli commerci drug. But an acquisit is still possible.Weigh down by a heavi debt load and commerci expens associ with it pancreat cancer drug Onivyde, Merrimack announc a massiv layoff last fall. The layoff gave the compani some wiggl room, but it wasn't enough, so the board cut a deal to sell Onivyd to Ipsen for $575 million up front, plu promis of up to $450 million in mileston payments.Th compani plan to return $200 million of the up-front money to investor as a special dividend, and plan to retir $175 million in long-term debt. Manag will also invest $125 million of the windfal back into it clinical-stag drug pipeline.Thi deal give Merrimack Pharmaceut a cash runway that stretch into 2019; hopefully, that will be enough time for manag to prove that the remain drug in it pipelin are worthwhile. Those drug includ MM-121, which is be evalu in non-smal cell lung cancer, MM-141, which is be studi in metastat pancreat cancer, and MM-310, a preclin drug that' expect to enter phase 1 trial thi year.Undeniably, the compani will be in better financi shape than it' been in years, onc thi deal closes. But trial uncertainti and ongo expens could make Merrimack Pharmaceut open to entertain offer from a suitor. If not, it might at least be will to cozi up with a deep-pocket biopharma on one or more of it remain drugs.10 stock we like better than Merrimack PharmaceuticalsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Stocks You've Been Overlooking,2/11/2017,"As much attent as stock and invest get on an everyday basis, there are load of great compani that still manag to fli under-the-radar. Whether it' becaus they are a small fish in a big pond, a compani without a lot of visibl for the averag consumer, or becaus they provid servic that few of us use, mani of these low key stock deserv a closer look.So we ask three of our contributor to each highlight a stock that get overlook by everyday investor but should be on their radars. Here' whi they think that toy-makerHasbro(NASDAQ: HAS) , rate agencyS&P Global(NYSE: SPGI) , andW.W. Grainger(NYSE: GWW) are stock investor should be on the lookout for.Imag source: Getti Iamges.makeArticleAd();Th toy maker with tight tie to DisneyBeth McKenna(Hasbro): A top stock mani individu investor seem to be overlook is Hasbro, the toy maker behind such icon favorit as Nerf, Play-Doh,Monopoly,and Transformers, and newer hits, such as Pie Face. One primari reason is like it size: Hasbro' market cap of $11.9 billion make it a larg cap stock, however, it' a small fri when it come to more popular stock across the market such asDisney($170.8 billion) andCoca-Cola($180.7 billion), also in the consum good realm, and Googl parentAlphabet($573.3 billion) andMicrosoft($490.2 billion) in technology.Thos of you who are think that Hasbro' long-term total return rel to more popular stock are probabl a big reason whi it fli under some investors' radar might be surpris to learn that Hasbro' return over the 10-year period, through Feb. 7, trump those of all of the stock of the compani list above. Moreover, Hasbro' return crush that of it prime competitor,Mattel, over thi period.Data byYCharts.Hasbro should remain a top-perform stock. It has, arguably, the strongest intern brand line-up in the grow toy industry. Moreover, Hasbro ha increasingli close tie toDisney-- and I can't think of a more power partner in which to help it sell it toys. Hasbro ha licens to make and market game and toy base upon sever top Disney properties:Star Wars,Marvel, Disney Descendants, and Disney Princess and andFrozen.Th compani snatch the lucr latter licens from Mattel in 2016.Hasbro continu to fire on all cylinders. It recent report fourth-quart and full-year 2016 result that trounc analysts' estimates, with year-over-year revenu grow 12.8% and adjust earn per share soar 27.1% in 2016.Excel busi at an averag priceJordan Wathen(S&P Global):S&P Globali an overlook cash cow. The company' core busi of softwar and intellig servic (which includ busi like Global Market Intellig and SNL Financial), and corpor debt rate (S&P), each make up about 45% of revenue. These two busi are wildli profitable. It rate busi gener oper margin of 50% in 2016, while market intellig gener an adjust oper profit margin of 34%.But incredibly, neither lead on margin. S&P Global' smallest busi by revenue, S&P Dow Jone Indices, effect earn a royalti on index fund and other index products. That line of business, which make up about 10% of revenue, gener a ridicul oper profit margin of 64%. In all, more than $1 trillion of investor asset can be found in an ETF or other index fund that track an S&P Global Index.I believ it three major line of busi like have a veri long runway of high single-digit revenu and earn growth, a realiti that doesn't seem bake in to it averag price-to-earn multiple.A behind-the-scen busi that crank out huge returnsTyl Crowe(W. W. Grainger):Compani that work behind the scene in busi get littl attent from investors. The fact that they are not consum face mean that they can easili be overlooked. One such compani that get overlook is W.W. Grainger. The maintenance, repair, and oper equip supplier ha been crank out high rate of return, steadi dividend growth, and consist share repurchas for decades, yet rare is it discuss as one of those must-own kind of investments.GWW Return on Equiti (TTM)data byYCharts.What also make Grainger a compel invest today is the larg growth level it can pull thank to new sale channels. For years, Grainger' busi mostli dealt with help with the procur process for medium-to-larg size businesses. These were the kind of compani that were larg enough to merit a custom support person on Grainger' end for sales. Now that the compani is build out an onlin sale platform, it can provid better servic to smaller businesses. Thi new sale channel is produc 35% annual revenu growth with 50% return on invest capital.Th one knock on the stock is that it isn't exactli cheap. It current trade at an enterpris valu to EBITDA ratio of 12.6 times, which is on the high end of it 10 year histor valuation. Consid the high rate of return it ha gener and it propens to throw cash back to sharehold with dividend and buybacks, though, it' a qualiti stock that may be worth pay up for.10 stock we like better than S and P GlobalWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

""A Ford expand to be an auto and a mobil company, we believ that invest in Argo AI will creat signific valu for our sharehold by strengthen Ford' leadership in bring self-driv vehicl to market in the near term and by creat technolog that could be licens to other in the future.""Ford will hold a major stake in the new company. Field wouldn't say exactli what Ford' ownership percentag will be, but he did say that it wa gaug to leav plenti of room to provid equiti compens to new employees.Ford' global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice presid of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the five seat on Argo AI' board. Saleski and Rander will hold two more, and the fifth will go to an independ director to be name later.Investors, take note: Field said that Argo AI' spend and result will be consolid into Ford' automot financi results, primarili in the North America region.What thi deal is realli aboutHere' how I'm think about thi deal: Ford just hire two rock star in AI and autonom vehicles, put them in charg of it self-driv softwar team, and structur the whole thing to give the team member -- and veri importantly, futur hires, in a field in which the competit for talent is fierc -- the upsid of a start-up with lower risk, becaus Ford' invest ha essenti capit the compani and Ford will be it first customer. It' an intrigu idea; it could turn out to be a brilliant one.Dur a confer call for analyst and media, Saleski emphas that the structur of what he call the ""collaboration"" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting: New hire (and Ford' exist virtual-driv team) will go to work for a start-up with signific potenti upside, not (directly, at least) for giant Ford.And while it' a start-up, Ford' involv mean that new hire can be assur that Argo AI ha both solid fund and a major customer. The combin of rel low risk with high potenti upsid should make for a potent recruit tool in a field where the competit for talent ha been extrem fierce.Th upshot: An intrigu move to boost Ford' technolog pushFor Ford, thi is a way to bring some deep AI expertis into it self-driv develop project, structur in a way that will help boost it recruit effort go forward. Nair said that he doesn't expect the deal to ""accelerate"" Ford' effort -- he stuck by theprevi announc 2021 deadlinefor Ford' first mass-produc self-driv vehicle.But there' a clear advantag to put the team under the leadership of Saleski and Rander, in a compani that offer the upsid of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait to learn more about the structur of the deal to evalu it fully, but right now it look like Ford ha taken an intrigu step ahead.10 stock we like better than FordWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And with top- and bottom-lin number that cruis by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answer the call. But the share appear muted, fall as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantag point, thi decline, which I consid inconsequential, is victori for Nvidia and it investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’ go though the numbers.In the three month that end December, Nvidia report net a incom of $655 million, or 99 cent per share. On an adjust basis, when take out one-tim gain and costs, earn came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensu estim by a whop 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenu also beat, come in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street wa look for revenu of $2.11 billion.Th strong bottom-lin beat wa driven by record quarterli GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the compani said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When look back at fiscal 2016, the compani broke sever of it own records, includ full-year revenu of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""W had a great finish to a record year, with continu strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement.

Admittedly, I wasn’t a believ until now. And while the tech battl ha alway been between Appl (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guy are not alon anymore.In term of the 3% declin on these solid numbers? Nvidia is be shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to declin 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still impli the momentum stori is still in place.

AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announc that AW had achiev an annual run rate of $14 billion, indic that it maintain a command lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azur in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claim that it ""commerci cloud"" had achiev an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of that total came from Saa platform like Offic 365 and Dynam CRM. Azur -- which compet directli against AW in the IaaS/Paa ""cloud platform"" market -- account for a much smaller percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclos how much revenu Azur generates, but combin earlier industri estim and it report growth rate over the past few quarter indic that it annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AW featuresAmazon alreadi serv massiv custom like NASA, the CDC, andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it' continu widen the platform' competit moat against rival platform like Azur with new features. Amazon ad over 1,000 new featur and servic to AW in fiscal 2016, compar to about 700 in 2015.It also open eleven new AW Avail Zone across five geograph region in 2016, bring AWS' total coverag to 42 Avail Zone across 16 region globally. That massiv data center expans will help AW reach more compani and developers, all while support the expans of it e-commerc and digit ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digit ecosystem expans is Prime Video, the company' stream answer to Netflix. Amazon ha made the platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscrib and a stand-alon subscript servic that cost slightli less than Netflix.Lik Netflix, Amazon is invest heavili in origin content, and popular show likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelp it becom the third largest video stream platform in the U.S. after YouTub and Netflix last year, accord to research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also follow Netflix' lead and invest heavili in local origin content in key market like Japan and India, which could help expand it Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skill for AlexaAmazon also taught it voic recognit platform Alexa 4,000 new skill sinc last October. It note that ""ten of thousand of developers"" are build new skill for the platform -- which power the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devic -- and that it wa work with ""a lot of major companies"" to integr their product with that ecosystem.Th expans of the Alexa ecosystem is important, becaus it can give Amazon control of users' connect home via Dash buttons, DRS-enabl appliances, and other connect devices. In addit to boost it e-commerc revenu with ""frictionless"" orders, that platform can process data through AW and widen it moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet' Google, which is tri to establish it own home-bas ecosystem around it Home smart speaker.Th key takeawayAmazon' fourth quarter report wa lumpy, but investor shouldn't overlook these posit numbers. Analyst still expect Amazon' revenu and earn to respect rise 22% and 53% next year -- so it overal growth won't peak anytim soon. Therefore, I believ that investor should take advantag of Amazon' temporari swoon and pick up a few more share for the long term.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To a lesser extent, Snap also purchas infrastructur servic fromAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();In the amend filing, Snap provid some addit detail on it relationship with the e-commerc giant.Alway have a conting planTo be clear, Googl Cloud is still Snap' main flame, but it never hurt to have backup. In fact, conting plan is absolut critic when your entir servic reli on third-parti infrastructur partners, and thi is the role that AW will play. The deal wa ink just yesterday, which is what' trigger the S-1 amendment.In last week' version, Snap said: ""We are current negoti an agreement with anoth cloud provid for redund infrastructur support of our busi operations."" That line wa replac in thi week' version with: ""We have also commit to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Servic over the next five year for redund infrastructur support of our busi operations."" Snap say an exist agreement with AW that wa origin enter into in March 2016 wa amend on Feb. 8, 2017.That $1 billion commit will slowli ramp up, start with $50 million in spend thi year. That' a tini drop in the bucket compar to the $12.2 billion in sale that AW did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AW in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Googl Cloud that wa final on Jan. 30, 2017 call for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a littl bit of leeway in shift spend to subsequ year (up to 15% in each of the first four years).Data source: Snapchat amend S-1.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers,2/9/2017,"One of the mani interest detail reveal inSnap' S-1 file with the SEC is that it agre to a $2 billion contract with Googl Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiari span five year with rel equal payment schedul for everi year.Snap ha use Googl Cloud sinc it creation, but had been spend consider less than the $400 million per year it' slate to spend through 2021. For the first few year of it existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Googl Cloud. Last year, however, it start see it host cost increas considerably, up $192 million for the year.Imag Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google' cloud servic compet against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Servic andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infus could help it catch up to the competition.What doe $2 billion mean to Googl Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactli forthright with it cloud revenue. It lump Googl Cloud in with Google' other revenu line item, which also includ Googl Play and hardwar sales. In 2016, the three categori produc $10.1 billion in revenue. Googl Play like account for the bulk of revenue.Th cloud unit had an estim run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, accord to RBC Capital. Snap' new contract like make it Google' biggest cloud customer.Whil Googl ha made sever advanc in it cloud servic over the past year, so have it competitors. Microsoft boast that it Azur revenu increas 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estim the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein' Mark Mordler estim Azure' run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just report AW sale top $12 billion in 2016. Sale surpass $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analyst expectations.Googl still need to diversifyTh growth of Snapchat ha been a major boon to Google' cloud services, but it' still activ seek to pull custom away from it competitor and take market share. The hire of cloud-comput veteran Dian Green to lead the divis ha help the compani attract numer high-profil customers, but there' still more work to do.On Alphabet' fourth-quart earn call, Googl CEO Sundar Pichai said, ""We have truli differenti offer in four key areas: data analyt and machin learning, secur and privacy, tool for applic development, and the abil to creat connect busi platforms."" Snap can take advantag of at least three of those four factors, so it' clear whi it wa will to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap want to enter China, for example, where Googl doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google' competitors. Or it could build it own servers.Snap recent hire Jerri Hunter from AWS, who ran global data center for the cloud-comput giant. In Snap' S-1 filing, manag notes, ""In the future, we may invest in build our own infrastructur to better serv our customers.""If Snap continu to grow at the pace it ha been for the last few years, it may make econom sens for it to switch to it own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What thi mean for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggl room: The contract say it can postpon up to 15% of expens for a year, so it onli ha to spend $340 million thi first year. Still, that' a huge amount for a compani that gener just $404.5 million in revenu last year.It also mean that switch servic provid will be difficult, consid it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leav at least some of it oper on Googl Cloud in order not to wast the money. That make the econom of build out it own infrastructur within the next five year even costlier.On the flip side, analyst expect Snap' revenu to continu grow at a rapid pace, approach $1 billion thi year fuel by continu user growth and product expans that will sure put addit demand on Google' servers. It ha plenti of capit to cover the expense, and if last year' growth is ani indic of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructur thi year. The deal with Googl ensur that it get the lowest rate possible, so it can to make the most of it spend.Overall, it' not a bad deal for Snap, but it doe tie the compani to Googl for a long time.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The compani post EP of $0.13 when the Zack Consensu Estim wa call for $0.07. That $0.06 beat wa good for a posit earn surpris of 85%. That big beat put the stock on a lot of radar screen but it is the Bull of the Day for another, much more import reason.DescriptionIntevac make vacuum deposit equip for variou thin-film applications, and digit night-vis technolog and products. Intevac, Inc. wa found in 1990 and is headquart in Santa Clara, California.Growth And ValueGrowth investor and valu investor are look for differ thing and usual a good growth stock is not a value. IVAC post revenu growth of 76% on a year over year basi in the most recent report. That follow growth of 23% in the previou period.On the valu side, the compani note that book valu at the end of the quarter as $71M, and with the stock trade at just under $200M in market cap we have a 2.8x price to book multiple.

So, it might be best to temper expect for Snap Inc. But here are some fact to help put the next big tech IPO into perspective.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Fre Report) tri to buy Snapchat for $3 billion cash in 2013. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat' co-found and CEO, turn the offer down. Sinc then,th social media giant ha focus on compet with and mimick Snapchatin the race to own the under-34 demograph online.Snapchat began as a disappear pictur and video messag app. And it quickli becam popular with young people.

Nielsen report a 37% declin in the amount of time 18-to-24-year-old watch TV between 2010 and 2016. And mani report indic that a larger percentag of advertis budget will be spent onlin by 2020.Snapchat ha partnership with the four major North American profession sport leagues, MLB, the NFL, the NHL and the NBA.

Time sensit ha foster massiv activ user engagement, which is key to it long-term profitability.A portion of Snap' IPO pitch focus on it abil to engag with the 18-to-34-year-old demographic.

"What Is Unearned Revenue, and Why Should Amazon Investors Care About It?",2/9/2017,"A small line item onAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balanc sheet ha been grow rapidli over the past coupl years. Sinc the end of 2014, Amazon' unearn revenu liabil increas from $1.8 billion to $4.8 billion. Some investor might see a grow liabil and think that' bad news, but in fact thi is veri good news.Unearn revenu is simpli cash custom have paid to Amazon in advanc for servic it ha yet to render. For example, Prime member typic pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day ship program. Amazon immedi take the cash and put it on it balanc sheet, but it amort the $99 of revenu over the 12 month of the membership. So it account for onli $8.25 per month in revenu per month for each Prime member. The rest of the cash receiv for Prime is held in the unearned-revenu balance.Prim growth ha been veri good over the past few years. Amazon say it ad ""ten of millions"" of new member last year. But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearn revenue. More likely, Amazon Web Servic (AWS) is the biggest factor push the balanc higher.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Mayb last quarter wasn't so disappointingFor the first time sinc Amazon start break out AW revenu and income, the cloud-comput segment miss analysts' expectations. Sale total $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, where analyst were expect $3.6 billion on average.But unearn revenu climb $568 million from the previou quarter. That' unusu for Amazon' fourth quarter. Usually, unearn revenu spike in the first quarter as cloud custom presum re-up short-term contract for the year.Most of Amazon' AW custom are small busi use it pay-as-you-go pricing, which allow them to quickli scale their use. The solut work well for compani with small or unpredict user bases.But a lot of AWS' money come from the big enterpris that spend hundr of million everi year on cloud computing. For those companies, with more predict usag needs, Amazon offer ""reserv instances,"" which offer a discount if custom pay up front. Growth in reserv instances, or other long-term contracts, may have result in lower revenu in the short term, but it nearli guarante revenu in the future.Lock in customersA the competit for cloud-comput infrastructur continu to heat up, long-term contract may prove invaluable. Lock in custom for a rel long term mean those enterpris will start optim their code so that it run more effici on the specif hardwar and platform they'r using.Such is the case withSnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which use Google' cloud. In it S-1 filing, Snap say it built it app to use ""servic provid by Google, some of which do not have an altern in the market,"" asRe/Code'sPet Guagenti point out. Not onli did Snap just agre to a $2 billion five-year contract with Google, but it' also go to be hard for it to leav Googl even after the five year is up. That' excel news forAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excel for Snap investors.Ultimately, sign long-term contract provid a moat against the grow competition. Not onli doe it lock in custom for the length of the contract, but it could also lock them in longer if they becom depend on certain featur of a cloud platform. In that light, Amazon' fourth-quart AW result look quit strong.Find out whi Amazoni one of the 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

"Snap, Inc. Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work?",2/8/2017,"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be lead the grow market for cloud infrastructure, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still put up a fight.Cloud infrastructur vendor have been crucial in enabl smaller start-ups, particularli those that are build mobil apps, to get up and run without have to worri as much about the back end. It' an appeal model sinc it allow smaller compani to simpli pay for what they need without have to invest in build the infrastructur themselves. In other words, it' an OpEx model versu a CapEx model, andGoogl is bet bigthat the market is go to shift to the OpEx model in a major way in the year ahead.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();But as compani grow, they often choos to invest in their own cloud infrastructure. Thi give them much more control over their own destinies, reduc risk, and over time the cost effici improv after the larg upfront investment.Soci media peersFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andTwitterboth oper their own data centers; Facebook announc itsseventh data centera few month back, while Twitter' infrastructur oper are expand more slowly, as it oper in co-loc facilities. Data center are so strateg import to Facebook that it help creat the Open Comput Project back in 2011, publicli share Facebook' infrastructur innov for the greater good.But notSnap(NYSE: SNAP) .Hey, big spenderSnap primarili reli on Googl Cloud for it infrastructur needs. While thi is entir par for the cours for mobil app start-ups, Snap ha grown to a size (nearli 160 million daili activ users) that would typic warrant invest in infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap' use of Googl Cloud is what' unpreced here. The Inform report that Googl land Snap with numer discount and other benefits, and Snap veri much reli on Googl Cloud at thi point, although it also use Amazon' AW to a lesser degree.Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobbi Murphi said the compani pick Googl Cloud over AW becaus the compani could scale better on Googl Cloud. Snap poach AWS' head of data center in Octob of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may impli that Snap ha longer-term ambit to build out it own infrastructure.But for now, Snap is firmli in bed with Googl Cloud, and spend quit a bit of money. Infrastructur cost compris the bulk of Snap' cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenu consist primarili of payment to third-parti infrastructur partner for host our products. Host cost primarili includ expens relat to bandwidth, computing, and storag costs."" Cost of revenu in 2016 wa $452 million, and Snap ha commit to spend $2 billion with Googl Cloud over the next five years.But at what cost?In discuss it oper leverage, Snap believ that use a capital-light busi model will translat into ""lower cost for us in both the short and long term."" That' definit true in the short term, but much more debat in the long term.Hav a larger proport of fix cost actual help with oper leverag as the busi grows, sinc those fix cost get spread out over an increas revenu base over time, reduc total averag costs. In contrast, if a company' cost structur ha a larger proport of variabl costs, those cost will scale commensur with revenue, so you don't get as much margin expansion. It' alreadi tell that Snap' cost of revenueexceededrevenu in 2016 ($405 million), result in neg gross margin.W saw thi all play out year ago in the semiconductor industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" model that are domin today. Build a chip fab cost billion of dollars, which wa a signific barrier to entry. Then contract chip manufactur came around and allow compani to focu more on design the chip while the manufactur partner would produc them. By outsourc product to a few larg chip manufacturers, the industri collect save billion and innov flourished. Semiconductor mostli shift to the OpEx model long ago, and there are onli a hand of compani that current manufactur their own chip these days.Snap is wade into unchart territori by reli on third-parti infrastructur partner at thi scale. Whether or not thi prove right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grow from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspir start-up and infrastructur vendor will be watch close to see how thi experi unfolds.10 stock we like better than SnapWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Amazon and Samsung Offerings Could Eat Into Google Search,2/8/2017,"Let me start by state the obvious:Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl is the undisput champion of search.

Your Snap Shares Won't Get You Any Votes,2/8/2017,"One of the most interest aspect ofSnap's(NYSE: SNAP) IPO file is that the share it' offer to the public will have no vote right at all. As a result, co-found Evan Spiegel and Bob Murphi will continu to control a combin 88.6% of the compani -- 44.3% each. ""Although other U.S.-bas compani have publicli trade class of non-vot stock, to our knowledge, no other compani ha complet an initi public offer of non-vot stock on a U.S. stock exchange,"" manag wrote in it S-1 filing.Indeed, other compani have restructur their stock class so that a founder-CEO can remain in control. Snap is just be more blunt about who' realli run the show here.Imag source: Snap.makeArticleAd();Most recently,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) announc plan for a stock split so Mark Zuckerberg could maintain control of the compani as he give away most of hi wealth to nonprofit and other causes.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also restructur it share in 2014 to keep it founder in control. Snap is set thing straight from the get-go.A simpl look at Snap' vote rightsSnap ha three class of stock, and the vote right are laid out like so:ClassVot Per ShareClass A0Class B1Class C10Source: Snap S1 filing.Individu investor will onli be abl to buy Class A share at Snap' IPO. The share class do convert. One share of Class C is convert into one share of Class B. One share of class B is convert into one share of Class A. (No, you can't convert share the other way around.) As such, all share of Snap stock, regardless of class, will particip equal in the profit of the company.How much is a vote worth?Alphabet ha the same vote structur for it stock, with the caveat that A share have one vote, B share have 10, and C share have no vote. Facebook announc it would split it share the same way at some point in the future.Shar of Alphabet provid the best look at how much investor valu vote rights. Class A shares, which provid one vote, trade for a slight premium to the non-vot Class C shares. That premium is current about 2.5%.Alphabet A share vs C shares. Source: Ycharts.So vote right do repres some valu to shareholders, or at least potenti shareholders. Activist investor could buy up a signific portion of vote right such that they can at least have some sway at sharehold meetings. With Snap' IPO, those share won't be avail to buy.Wher thing get messyFollow the IPO, Evan Spiegel will receiv an addit 3% of all share outstand paid out quarterli over the next three year as a bonus. Those will be Class C shares, and Spiegel will then be abl to exercis complet control over the company. In the meantime, there' potenti for deadlock vote between Spiegel and co-found Bob Murphy, as they each control equal-s stakes.But that' not the most concern thing about the capit structur at Snap. The onli way for the founder to lose control of the compani is if they both die. As describ in the S-1 filing, ""Either of our co-founders' share of Class C common stock will automat convert into Class B common stock, on a one-to-on basis, nine month follow hi death."" If that happens, the other co-found will have a control share of the votes.In other words, both founder could leav the compani but still be abl to exercis control over it.Facebook made provis to it stock split to ensur that Zuckerberg would onli control the company' vote right as long as he remain CEO.There' a provis on Alphabet' Class B sharehold that for everi Class C non-vot share they sell, they must convert one Class B share into a Class A share, and presum sell that as well. That make it more difficult for the founder to retain complet control. In fact, their combin percentag of the shareholders' vote ha fallen from 61% at the time of the stock split to about 57% today.Snap' structur make it so that not onli do individu investor have no vote rights, but the founder will continu to control the compani until both of them die. That' put a lot of trust in the founders, ad more risk to an alreadi riski investment.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Ubiquiti’s Run Continue in 2017?,2/7/2017,"While mani technolog investor no doubt enjoy major gain in the high-profil large-cap tech name in 2016, mid-cap wireless companyUbiqu Networks(NASDAQ: UBNT) also had itself quit a year, rocket 125% in just the past 12 months. The compani continu to fli under the radar, despit have 38-year-old CEO who not onli own the Memphi Grizzli but can alsodunk a basketball.Tak that, Zuckerberg and Musk!In it most recent quarter end Sept. 30, revenu grew 35%, and non-GAAP EP grew a whop 55% year over year, larg on the strength of the Unifi segment. With the recent move in the stock, investor may be wonder if they'v miss the boat, but I think the momentum can continu in 2017 for the follow reasons.makeArticleAd();IMAG SOURCE: UBIQU NETWORKS, INC.Unifi goe up the valu chainA I mentioned, the star of 2016 for Ubiqu wa Unifi, which grew 75% in the Septemb quarter. Thi segment make low-cost enterpris hardwar products, such as wireless access points, switches, routers, secur cameras, and VOIP phones, along with softwar that allow IT profession to track larg network from a singl user interface. Ubiquiti' low-cost busi model -- the compani employ almost no sale forc or servic professionals, and hire a limit number of ""all-star"" engin -- enabl it to produc solid wi-fi product at rock-bottom prices, and the product line caught fire in 2016. In January, however, the compani unveil a new line of advanc product aim at higher-end customers, which is the turf of IT giant such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHP(NYSE: HPE) . The new product includ the US-16-XG Switch for $599 and a new Wave 2 access point for $349. These are much higher price point than tradit Unifi products, but still much lower than high-end access point vendor such as Cisco' Meraki ($1,399), HP' Aruba ($1,395) andBrocade's(NASDAQ: BRCD) Rucku ($1,295). Should Ubiqu make inroad into higher-end deployments, these new product could drive Ubiquiti' already-sky-high 35% oper margin even higher.Ubiqu look as if it is final make it move to disrupt legaci IT players, just as promin ventur capitalist (and former Ubiqu board member) Bill Gurley predict in 2014:""The fact that Cisco ha never had a price disruptor over 30 year seem to violat the rule of the ""Innovator' Dilemma."" I think mani peopl believ that a disrupt from underneath is overdue. If I had to bet on anyon pull that off it would be [Ubiqu CEO] Robert [Pera].""Airmax refreshWhil Unifi wa the star of 2016, Ubiquiti' biggest segment is still Servic Provider, which account for 59% of total revenues. Under the Airmax and Airfib brands, thi segment make high-pow radio that beam Wi-Fi over long distanc while achiev cable-lik speeds. These radio are the build block for Wireless Internet Servic Provid (WISPs) in rural and emerg market worldwide, where fiber or satellit is too expensive, and the spectrum is less cluttered. Airmax growth had stall in the past two year from it hyper-growth period a few year ago, yet still grew 15% year over year in the Septemb quarter.Ther are reason to think that 2017 could bring a reacceler for Airmax and it associ products. First, Ubiqu drop the ball somewhat when it initi releas Airmax AC, as these hyper-fast product were not backwards-compat with older Airmax M radios. That meant servic provid custom would have to refresh their entir network of radio in order to upgrade, as oppos to upgrad radio-by-radio. Thi wa fix in Decemb with the releas of new firmwar AirO 8.0, which wa no small task (it took over a year!). Second, Pera recent reveal sever new Airmax product for 2017, includ a GPON fiber product. While Ubiquiti' radio are normal use to replac fiber, Ubiqu found out that mani of it emerging-market custom can lay fiber along power line veri cheaply, and thi new product should add to their arsenals. Even more exciting, the compani reveal an entir new ASIC (application-specif integr chip) it ha develop call LTU. As Pera explained:""It' been well over 3 year in the making, and we'r go to launch it next year. And it' go to be essenti airFib multipoint. But it' go to be light-year ahead of anyth in the market, and at cost point relev to airMAX, we'r go to price it higher. The margin are go to be a lot better... we think that' go to be a realli big differenti in the market.""Again, we see Ubiqu make a move to grow out of it reput as just a low-cost vendor, and into a compani that sell higher-qu (and, therefore, higher-margin) product as well.AmplifiWhil Pera & Co. are at it, whi not enter a complet new custom segment? That' what Ubiqu did thi summer with the introduct of Amplifi, a consum router that will take onNetgear's(NASDAQ: NTGR) Orbi andGoogle's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) home router. Amplifi is gettingstellar reviewsso far, and just like Unifi' access points, it might pave the way for other ancillari product for the connect home.Even though the Amplifi wa unveil last summer, it hasn't produc much revenu for Ubiqu yet. Thi is not becaus the product wasn't great, but becaus the compani wa capacity-constrain for the last half of 2016. As Pera said:""What I'm really, really, realli frustrat about, is we didn't execut on the product side. So we had demand for ten of thousand of unit out of the gate, and we'v just been slow to get these out.""That is what I'd call have ""champagn problems."" And while Ubiqu is go up against strong competitor such as Google, Netgear, and others, the price-perform characterist of the product, as well as the secular tailwind of the connect home make me a believ that Amplifi could becom a meaning growth driver as earli as thi year.Th valuat is still reasonableEven after Ubiquiti' big move, the stock trade at a fairli reason 23 time trail earnings, which mean the market is price in decent, though not spectacular, growth from here. Still, with a disrupt busi model, a rock-solid balanc sheet, and a long runway in a secular growth industry, I think Ubiquiti' stock can exit 2017 a good deal higher than where it entered.Off from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

Assum Fitbit' cash and cash equival balanc of $284.2 million (a of Octob 1, 2016) remain roughli unchanged, then Fitbit' enterpris valu is bare $1 billion.Thi is a small price to pay for a fit track compani thatwa as of December(and like remains) the clear and undisput leader in the group.Rebound Stock to Buy: Mattel (MAT)Source:Horantheworld via Flickr (Modified)Mattel' unusu earn miss sent the stock tumbl to around $25, leav it at a loss of 18%-plu over the last year.Th reason for the massiv miss? The holiday sell season in both the U.S. and the intern market wa weak, and the holiday are when abouthalf of all toy are sold.No one is make excus or tri to diminish the sever of the poor report but investor look at the posit sign and will to sit on MAT stock for some time could be reward over the long-term - and collect a near-6% dividend yield at the same time.Her are some of the posit that reaffirm the long-term story.Th core Barbi brand which boast impress increment margin saw it revenu grow 9% (constant currency) for the full year, although sale were down in Q4.Sale of Fisher-Price, the company' biggest brand, realiz a 2% (constant currency) growth in the quarter.Th Wheel brand (Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Tyco R/C) saw an 18% sale increas (constant currency) on the quarter.Mattel is now led byform Googl exec Margaret Georgiadis, who wa recent name as CEO.7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialH tech-savvi experi - not to mention come in from an outsid entiti - could be just what is need for MAT stock move forward.Rebound Stock to Buy: Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockTh sentiment surround Under Armour ha been poor, and ani miss in it fourth-quart print would send share lower. However, the top-and-bottom miss wa also coupl with a poor 2017 guidanc and a surpris manag change, which result in the stock plung around 25%.But how much wors can it get? In short, there realli isn't much more that can go wrong.Q4 gross margin fell to 44.8% from 48% a year ago and 2017' gross margin are expect to fall from 2016' level. We can cross gross margin eros off our list of concern for 2017 becaus weknowit will happen.UAA stockr guid it 2017 oper incom to be lower on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, we can scratch thi off our list of concern for 2017 becaus we know it will happen.And we can also scratch off the sudden departur of a key executive, as Under Armour' CFO Chip Molloy announc he will be leav the company.And the fact remain that Under Armour' wide varieti of product is still in high demand, and there is plenti of room to grow.Al UAA stock need to do is beat the lower bar for 2017, which some analyst believ is conservative. There is a lot go on Under Armour' favor, includ a new partnership with retailerKohl' Corporation(NYSE:KSS) and the larg intern opportunity, which the compani isn't lose it sight on.A of thi writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Th post3 Stock to Buy for Their Come Reboundappear first onInvestorPlace."
GM's Race To Win Self-Driving Car War Provides Long-Term Opportunity,2/7/2017,"Like Tesla (TSLA), Googl (GOOG,GOOGL) spinoff Waymo, Ford (F) and a host of others, Gener Motor (GM) is go full-forc in the race to be the leader in autonom cars.A new studi show that it' further along than previous thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they'r not happi with the company' fourth-quart results.Th California Depart of Motor Vehicl releas a number ofreportsearli thi month from variou automak and tech compani on what they'r do as it relat to self-driv car and GM, long thought to be cede the race, ha vault it position, thank to acquisit and heavi spending.makeArticleAd();Cruis Automation, which GMboughtfor more than $1 billion in March 2016, is use a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EV to test it softwar and it car out in the field. Cruis now ha more than 20 vehicl licens in California, up from just two in earli 2016, when it wa use a coupl of Nissan Leafs.Thi is a bright sign for the Mari Barra-l company, as it look to own the entir ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of cede the race to others.It' like to keep deal further into in thi area, whether it'spartn with Lyftor ad engin to it self-driv car fleet in order to keep test and build car inDetroit.Project like thi are like to help sharehold in the long-run, even if it impact spend in the interim.In the fourth-quarter, GM earn $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estim $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales.

There may be a need for less cars, sinc they could be work more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massiv resurg in sales, as cost come down and regul incentiv manufactur to make transport safer.It' just a huge unknown at thi point.GM ha been build and manufactur car for over 100 years, give it a leg up, at least in term of the manufactur process, over ani of it Silicon Valley competitors. Thi is someth that Barra ha consist cite as an advantage.“W have 100 year of realli understand vehicles, put them on the road, make sure we have a safe, high-qual vehicle,” Barra told report at a Decemb press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are go to have a veri special offer to the consumer.”Th world is still a way away fromLevel 5 autonomy(tru autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in ani condit anywher without ani help from a human), so the self-driv car race is far from over.But it look like GM, which ha notori been secret about it operations, is a lot further along than anyon thought.

Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock May Get Snapped After Earnings,2/7/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsInvestor have been get bullish withTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR), as the stock ha climb about 13% so far on the year. As usual, there have been the variou buyout rumors, which have probabl account for quit a bit of the gain.makeArticleAd();Source:Andrea Eldh via FlickrYet might all thi be anoth exampl of over eager with Twitter stock? Perhap there will just be more disappoint when the compani report it earn on Thursday?Well, the good news is that the bar is not set too high. The Street is expect for Twitter earn to come to 12 cent a share (on an adjust basis) and revenu to hit $740.1 million.Bi comparison,last yearth compani report profit of 16 cent a share and a top-lin of $710 million.In other words, the consensu is for the revenu to grow by a mere 4.2%, which would repres the slowest ramp sinc TWTR becam a public company. To put thi into perspective,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)generateda massiv $8.6 billion in revenu in Q4, up a sizzl 53%. So is it ani wonder that Twitter stock ha been mostli a bad investment?7 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialOf cours not.Now, in term of the quarter, TWTR stock could benefit from some catalysts. Some of those includ the impact of the holiday season as well as the wild presidenti elect and the live-stream of NFL games.But such thing will like be temporari for Twitter stock. The fact is that the lacklust user growth will probabl continu to weigh on the company. For example, Cantor' Youssef Squali isforecastingonli a 2 million net monthli activ user increas in the base to 319 million, up 4.6%. Thi would be roughli the same as Q3' growth rate.But none of thi should be a surprise. TWTR ha been beset with frequent turnov in the execut ranks. It also doe not help that the CEO, Jack Dorsey, spend time as the head ofSquar Inc(NYSE:SQ).Hey, do Zuckerberg orSnap'sEvan Spiegel side gigs? No, becaus they realiz that the onlin world is brutal competitive.Bottom Line on Twitter StockActually, the Snap IPO may put even more pressur on Twitter stock. Investor will soon have anoth high-growth play to put their money into. As a result, TWTR stock will becom more marginalized.Now. Dorsey ha talk about improv the servic and make it easier to use. But so far, the action have fallen flat. Granted, at the start of the New Year, he ask user for feedback. Yet much of it wa kind of vague. Instead, user would rather spend their time on platform like FB, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. It' that simple. For the most part, TWTR ha fail to keep up with the latest trends, such as with chat and video.Unfortunately, when a consum tech compani get into thi situation, it is tough to turn thing around. Just look at classic exampl likeYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) andAOL. They spent year tri to find way to juic up user number - but noth seem to work.Part of thi is that the brand quickli lose it luster. But there is someth else: resourc start to dwindl as cash flow drop.In fact, both seem to be issu with Twitter stock. If anything, the brand appear kind of crusti and is also associ with harass and bullying. Oh, and in term of the core operations, the compani ha been reduc the workforc and unload variou segments, such as the recent sale ofFabrictoAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Th like end-gam for TWTR stock, of course, is a sale of the company. But of course, the problem there is that when the compani put itself up on the block last year, there wa littl interest.Thi doe not mean thing are absolut hopeless.

Is Advertising Amazon's Next Big Growth Product?,2/7/2017,"In digit advertis there areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there' everyon else. But one compani is start to emerg as a potenti contend to the two ad behemoths:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is start to spread it wing as an advertiser.Amazon certainli ha the user data to compet with Facebook or the bigAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it ha onli 300 million activ custom as of it last update, the shop data it ha on those user is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be abl to target advertis better than Facebook or Googl despit their huge trove of user data. After all, noth speak louder than how peopl spend their money.Imag source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();What' thi other revenu line item, and why' it grow so quickly?Dur Amazon' fourth-quart earn call, UB analyst Eric Sheridan ask about the ""other"" line item on Amazon' incom statement. He point out that it' exhibit a lot of momentum over the past few year and wonder if that wa due to growth in advertising.Th other categori includ ""certain advertis servic and our co-brand credit card agreements,"" accord to Amazon' quarterli report. While Amazon did just revamp it credit card offering, it' been around in some form in the U.S. sinc 2002 and in Canada sinc 2012. The vast major of growth in the categori is probabl come from advertising.And it' been growing. Last year, other revenu in North America increas 60%. That acceler to 81% growth in the fourth quarter. That make it Amazon' fastest grow sourc of revenue, grow even faster than it cloud-comput service, Amazon Web Services.Granted, the other revenu Amazon bring in account for just 1.7% of it total North American sale -- $1.3 billion. So it' still work on a veri small revenu base.Expand it ad productsMost of the ad Amazon sell are on it own websites. Search result on Amazon have an increas number of sponsor products, with which third-parti merchant pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlik Google' search advertising. Manag describ sponsor product as ""off to a great start,"" indic they see a lot of room for expansion.A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of onlin shopper begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more peopl search Amazon for products, the more ad it can show. In fact, sponsor product could start steal ad budget away from Google, which is whyEric Schmidt said it' Google' biggest competitorin 2014.But Amazon' advertis is start to extend beyond it own websites, wade deep into Google' territory. Last year it develop a header-bid solution. Header bid allow publish to take more offer for their ad inventori instead of wade through each offer one by one and take the first decent one they find. (Thi is all done extrem quickli by comput algorithms.)Amazon' advantag in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithm ad bid process in it AW servers, enabl publishers' websit to load faster than other header-bid system allow. Googl ha histor domin the space that header bid threatens.A mentioned, Amazon is one of the few compani with user data that can compet with the target capabl of Facebook or Google. So if it continu to build out it advertis product on third-parti websites, it could start to take a signific share of revenu from Googl and Facebook. Googl gener $15.6 billion in revenu from it network members' websit last year. Facebook' Audienc Network reach a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the compani hasn't provid ani updat sinc then.Th digit ad market is huge. Advertis spent $195 billion worldwid on onlin ad last year, accord to eMarketer. That number is expect to grow to $335 billion by 2020.

3 Stocks We're Never Selling,2/6/2017,"We Fool are constantli on the hunt for win stock idea that we believ will gener strong return for year on end. When we think we have identifi a win business, we like to buy it and hang on to it through thick and thin.With that in mind, we ask a team of Fool to highlight a stock in their portfolio that they plan to hang on to for the ultra-long term. Read on to see whi they pickedAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Under Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , andStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet will continu to benefit from digit browsingJam Carnette, CFA(Alphabet): The market wasn't kind to Alphabet' recent report fourth-quart and full-year results. Overall, the compani continu to post enviabl growth rate for a compani of it scale. Alphabet increas revenu 20.4% over the previou year' results; on a quarterli basis, it grew revenu 22.2% over last year' correspond period. However, the company' fourth-quart bottom line increas by onli 8.3%, to $5.3 billion, as Alphabet' provis for incom tax increas by a massiv 450% over last year' correspond quarter, on account of a one-tim tax adjustment. Still, the fickl market sold off share to the tune of 2% becaus the compani miss analyst expectations.On a posit note, Alphabet confirm that mobil search is one of it highest-growth areas. The biggest shift in internet brows over the past five year ha been from desktop to mobile, and that move benefit Alphabet, consid Googl control approxim 95% of the mobile-search market.Th compani also continu to grow it advertis business. Earlier thi year, a shock report fromMorgan Stanleyanalyst Brian Nowak found that 85% of everi new dollar in onlin advertis wa go to just two companies: Alphabet andFacebook. As the shift to onlin advertis continues, look for Alphabet to continu to post strong revenu growth rates.Simpli put, Alphabet' long-term thesi remain intact. The compani is the largest digit advertis and search engin in the world, and Alphabet will onli continu to grow search and advertis revenu as internet usag increas from a combin of penetr and accessibility, while a push for digit advertis will boost the company' bottom line.Stil a believ in Under ArmourBrian Feroldi(Und Armour): The past six month haven't been kind to Under Armour' shareholders. The stock took a big hit inlat October, after manag ratchet back it long-term growth targets. More recently, share gotcrushedaft the compani report sale growth of just 12% in the all-import fourth quarter. Not onli wa that figur far shi of management' guidance, but the company' CFO also resign suddenly. That' a lot of bad news for investor to take in all at one time, so it wa no surpris to see that share took a big hit.However, a closer look at the quarter hint that investor shouldn't throw in the towel on thi growth stori just yet. While total sale growth wa disappointing, the biggest culprit wa slow sale in North America. That' understandable, as the retail environ statesid wa quit challeng for mani retail over the holidays. The recent bankruptci of The Sport Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sport Chalet, Golfsmith, Citi Sports, and Bob' Store didn't help the matter, either.However, Under Armour' report did contain a hand of bright spots. Direct-to-consum sale -- which bypass retail altogeth -- jump by 23% and now account for nearli 40% of total sales. And footwear sale grew by a solid 36% year over year. Best of all, intern revenu grew by 55% and now compris 16% of total sales. These figur suggest that Under Armour' brand still remain strong.Whil the compani ha some near-term challeng to overcome, I have a hard time believ that thi growth stori is dead. As long as founder and CEO Kevin Plank is at the helm, thi is one stock I can't ever see myself part way with.Middle-class peopl love their coffee, and there' about to be a lot more of themJasonHall(Starbucks): The global coffe giant' stock is down around 8% sinc first-quart earn came out in late January, and not without some justification. After all, Starbuck report that traffic in it North American store wa pretti much flat in the quarter, a trend that start in 2016 and could continu through 2017. Furthermore, manag indic that it may feel the same way and is now project revenu growth between 8% and 10%, a reduct from origin full-year guidanc of 10% or greater at the end of the prior quarter.But Starbuck isn't the kind of compani that will scare me away with a minor flatten of growth in it most matur market -- especi not right now. Starbucks' best day could be ahead of it, even as Howard Schultz step down as CEO for the second time.To start with, Starbucks' growth opportun in Asia is simpli enormous. Within a decade, the middl class in China alon is like to be doubl the size of the U.S., and Starbucks' manag recent said it expect China to becom the company' biggest market. Here' a littl more context: At the start of 2017, Starbuck had nearli 16,000 store in the Americas, versu fewer than 6,800 in the China/Asia Pacif region, with 2,500 of those in China.Bottom line: Growth veri well could slow further -- or even stall -- in the company' more matur markets, but I won't sell. The global growth stori is onli get started, and that' go to drive decad of growth. I'm not miss out on that.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (C shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It wa valu at $45 billion, hire a promin execut away fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl and plan an expans into America.makeArticleAd();Source: XiaomiToday? It ha drop out of the top five smartphon vendor list, marketshar in China ha plummeted, the Googl exec ha jump ship and some analyst are valu the compani as low as $3.6 billion.What happen to Xiaomi and is it threat to Appl truli neutralized? Or are the troubl Chines tech giant' plan mere on hold?Xiaomi' Rapid RisePriv held Xiaomi wa found in 2010, releas it first smartphon in 2011 and rapidli gain popular in China. The compani offer high-qual in it smartphones, with low price -a combin that led to it be the top-sel smartphon brand in China by 2014.It came seemingli out of nowher to captur thethird place spot for worldwid smartphon salesthat year as well. The feat wa especi impress given that Xiaomi wa not sell it phone in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Googl andSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the compani want to expand into consum electron in general. That effort includ the inexpens Mi Band fit tracker that vault Xiaomi intosecond place worldwid for wearabl salesbi 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).Th compani pursu a strategi of invest in hardwar startups, buy into dozen of compani make everyth from smart light to headphon and TVs. While these product are not alway Xiaomi-branded, they are design to all work well together.It also ad softwar and servic to the mix.Chines CompetitionTh success of Xiaomi spur homegrown competition. Other Chines manufactur step up to the plate and follow Xiaomi' formula. However, they did a better job of market to increasingli demand Chines consum by charg a littl more but offer more strike designs. One of these compani -Huawei- wa good enough that Googlepartn with it to build the Nexu 6P smartphon in 2015. Xiaomi' phone seem lower qualiti than these competitor and rather than innovative, it design are often seen as be too similar to Apple's.At thi point, Xiaomi ha been leapfrog by it Chines smartphon rivals. While Xiaomi ha drop off the global top five smartphon manufactur list, China' Huawei,OppoandVivocurr hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi' ambit were an expans into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompani hire Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product manag - from Google.However, Xiaomi' U.S. push ha fail to materialize. There are dozen of product Xiaomi offer onlin through itsMi Store(which carri onli a fraction of Xiaomi' and it partner companies' gear), includ eight differ smartphon models, multipl smart TVs, VR headset and even a self-balanc electr scooter. U.S. custom are limit to be abl to buy a few set of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a batteri pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in move into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi ha taken advantag of China' rel lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasban from sell smartphon in Indiaa a result of a patent infring rule (it ha sinc resum Indian operations). If Xiaomi tri to push into the U.S. with it smartphon at thi point, there' a good chanc Appl and other tech compani would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against thi scenario, Xiaomi ha begun buy up patents. Last year,it purchas 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relat to area like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At thi point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalu at as littl as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plu smartphones, miss it initi goal of 100 million and then the revis goal of 80 million. It' refus to say how mani it sold in 2016, but that silenc speak volumes.Hugo Barra bail on the companya few week ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few month befor leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphon sale wouldn't impact the companybecaus it made no money on them:""Bas we'r give [handsets] to you without make ani money… we care about the recur revenu stream over mani years. We could sell 10 billion smartphon and we wouldn't make a singl dime in profits.""Th problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphon still account for 95% of the company' revenue. All those other product and servic just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told report not to expect Xiaomi to releas a smartphon in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reason Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than It Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junpost a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admit the compani had push ahead too fast, cut into it long-term growth, but say the worst is over.Th company' revenu target is RMB 100 billion (roughli $14.5 billion) -the same as it 2015 target. In tri to be so much, so fast, Xiaomi ha set itself up for some veri challeng times.

Will Facebook Challenge Netflix and Amazon Via Set Top Boxes?,2/5/2017,"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedli develop a dedic video app for set top box to expand it social network ecosystem into live rooms, accord to theWal Street Journal. The app will be differ from it exist app for set top boxes, which is basic just a widescreen version of it mobil app.Imag source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Instead, the new app will mainli deliv video from Facebook, potenti turn it into a stream rival toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Thi support previou report that Facebook wa look to licens origin content, and suggest that it user could deliv live broadcast to TV via Facebook Live.Wil thi move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTub alreadi too far ahead in the video stream wars?Understand Facebook' video effortsYouTub is the biggest video stream site in the world, but Facebook' video ecosystem ha been grow quickly. Last January, Facebook reveal that it user watch 100 million hour of video per day. At the time,Busi Insiderestim that YouTub user were watch about 650 million hour of video everi day.Dur last quarter' confer call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg call video ""a megatrend on the same order as mobile"", and highlight the way that video ecosystem wa expanding. It recent ad a new tab in the Facebook app for top video and recommend in the U.S., test a version of Live 360 video for slower connections, and ad live face mask and camera effects. It also plan to invest more in origin video content to ""seed that ecosystem"" throughout 2017.Facebook' interest in video make sense, sinc video ad cost much more than tradit display ads. As Facebook' activ user growth slow down, video ad can bolster it top line by milk more ad revenu from exist users. Sinc nearli 94% of Facebook' 1.86 billion monthli activ user alreadi access the site from mobil devices, it also need to look toward other platform -- like set top box -- to continu grow it ad ecosystem.Carv out a nich between Netflix and AmazonAt first glance, it seem like Facebook could collid with Netflix and Amazon' stream video ecosystems. But Facebook doesn't plan to spend hundr of million of dollar on big budget show likeHous of CardsandMan in the High Castle.Instead, Zuckerberg plan to focu on ""shorter-form content to start,"" note that the video will gener be split into content peopl produc social for friends, promot content from busi and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financ ""premium"" content to differenti it from other platforms. CFO David Wehner wa vagu about what that premium content would actual be, mere state that the compani wa ""look at a wide rang of content"" and ""work toward a revenu share model with creators.""Thos statement indic that Facebook want to carv out a nich on set top boxes, instead of trade costli blow with Netflix and Amazon. Sinc Facebook' video platform is all about deliv ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't be compet for Netflix or Amazon' subscription-bas revenues.I Facebook actual make a play for smart homes?Facebook' new set top box app could also help it gain a foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon ha alreadi establish a major presenc in home with it Kindl tablets, Fire TV set top boxes, and Echo speakers. Googl is tri to catch up with Home, andAppleteth devic to it HomeKit platform for iOS.Facebook doesn't have an offici hors in that race yet, but Zuckerberg recent showcas Jarvis, a smart home AI platform he develop for hi own home. The platform, which use voic command to control devices, is control via a Messeng bot.Imag source: Facebook.Bi expand Facebook' ecosystem to set top box like Appl TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network couldpotentiallypiggyback off that hardwar to sync with smart home devices. If Facebook link Messeng to those ""hubs"", it could take control of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and widen it moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other challengers.Th key takeawayFacebook' plan to expand it video ecosystem aren't surprising, and a dedic video app for set top box would be the logic next step. It won't challeng heavyweight like Netflix and Amazon, but it could captur a nich market of user who want to view Facebook video content on a stream platform optim for TVs.

"No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's",2/5/2017,"Last week, Brand Financ came out with itsannu list of brand valuations. In a somewhat shock finding, the consult group declar thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost it supremaci toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiari Google.Alphabet is a phenomen compani with a long track record of innovation, and the Googl brand is extrem powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same leagu as Apple' brand in term of total value.I Appl turn sour?Whil Brand Financ still rate Appl as the second most valuabl brand in the world, it appear to have a fairli neg view of the iPhon maker. Accord to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple' evangelist are begin to lose their faith. The snake queue of earli adopt have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Appl ha fail to maintain it technolog advantag and ha repeatedli disillus it advoc with tweak when materi chang were expected.Put simply, Appl ha over-exploit the goodwil of it customers, it ha fail to gener signific revenu from newer product such as the Appl Watch and cannot demonstr that genuin innov technolog desir by consum are in the pipeline. It brand ha lost it luster and must now compet on an increasingli level play field not just with tradit rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chines brand such as Huawei and OnePlu in the smartphon market, Apple' key sourc of profitability.A a result of thi assessment, Brand Financ reduc it estim of the Appl brand' valu by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estim Google' brand valu at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Financ cite Google' domin in search, among other things, to justifi the big increas in it brand value.Consum are pay more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance' declin opinion of the Appl brand is contradict by consumers' willing to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Appl report record quarterli iPhon sale of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the averag sell price (ASP) reach a new record of $695.The iPhone' ASP hit a new record last quarter. Imag source: Apple.In the same quarter two year ago, right after Appl releas the huge popular iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plus, the iPhone' ASP had surg 8% year over year, to $687. Apple' abil to continu grow that ASP over the past two years, despit face stiff foreign exchang headwind in both years, is a testament to the massiv valu of it brand.Indeed, the cost of high-qual smartphon is come down. Leav asid Samsung, sever Chines manufactur have becom known for design high-qual smartphon and sell them at near-breakeven price in recent years. Apple' abil to command a huge price premium over competitor -- which extend beyond smartphon to PC and (to a lesser extent) tablet -- indic that it brand is as strong as ever.Appl is a profit machineAccord to Brand Finance, Appl ha fail to maintain a technolog lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, mani tech pundit have argu in recent year that Samsung ha overtaken Appl in term of innovation.Assum that the two compani are on a rel even technolog footing, they should be abl to produc roughli similar earnings. However, that' not even close to be true.Last quarter, Appl bare retook the lead in term of smartphon shipment with 78.3 million, compar to 77.5 million shipment for Samsung,accord to Strategi Analytics. Yet Samsung' mobile-divis oper profit total just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple' oper profit wa more than 10 time higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basi -- or look just at the smartphon busi -- Apple' advantag is somewhat smaller. But ani way you slice it, Appl gener mani time more profit than Samsung. (In it most recent fiscal year, Apple' oper profit wa $60 billion, compar to about $10 billion for Samsung' mobil division.)If Appl doesn't have superior technolog rel to Samsung, it brand must be do most of the heavi lift to gener $50 billion of addit oper profit on an annual basis. That' more than doubl Alphabet'stotalannu oper profit of $23.7 billion.Googl may be a power brand. However, it doesn't come close to the valu of the Appl brand, which ha turn the tradit low-margin technolog hardwar busi into a long-term cash cow that churn out ten of billion of dollar of profit everi year.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"How Profitable Is SpaceX, Really?",2/5/2017,"Last year, prior to the big SpaceXplos -- which kind of knockedSpaceX off the rails-- we spent a lot of time dig into SpaceX' finances. We asked:How doe SpaceX make money? And we answer the question: ""How profit is SpaceX"" when it make all that money?Much of thi wa base on educ guesswork, however, as we extrapol what we knew about the financ at SpaceX rivalsBoeing(NYSE: BA) ,Lockhe Martin(NYSE: LMT) ,Orbit ATK(NYSE: OA) , andAirbus(NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , and appli it to what wethoughtthat might mean for SpaceX' own finances. It would have been a whole lot easier to just take a good hard look at SpaceX' own financi documents, and get the answer straight from the source.Lucki for us -- and for you --The Wall Street Journaljust did that.makeArticleAd();Here' your first look at SpaceX' CRS-8-mission rocket -- befor it becom the first ""reused"" orbit rocket in history. Now let' take a look at SpaceX' finances. Imag source: SpaceX.In a detailed,multi-pag expose, theJournalrev last monththat it ha come into possess of a treasur trove of intern financi document from SpaceX. Combin with interview of ex-SpaceX staff, theJournalwa abl to put togeth a pretti good pictur of SpaceX' finances.It isn't a pretti picture. Here' what we know.Wal Street Journalspil the bean on SpaceXSpaceX like to portray itself as a grow rival to space incumb such as Boe and Lockheed, Airbu and Orbit ATK. But in fact, SpaceX' revenu growth halt --temporarily, we hope-- in 2014. Two fail space launch in the past two year curtail launch activ at the space start-up, with the result that revenu actual peak in 2014, at roughli $1 billion.SpaceX' sale then declin to just $945 million in 2015, when the compani conduct onli six launches. (Revenu may have grown again in 2016, or it may not have. The document theJournalobtain appar didn't extend into 2016.)What the documentsdoshow, though -- and show quit clearli -- is that no matter how much revenu SpaceX records, it' not earn much profit from that revenue.Dissect SpaceX' financesA reveal in theJournal' report, SpaceX turn just a small fraction of it $1 billion in 2014 launch revenu into oper profit -- much lessnetprofit. The number aren't entir clear from theJournal' chart, but appear to show SpaceX earn an oper profit of perhap 0.2% on $1 billion in revenu -- profit far below the 10%-ish profit margin that Boe earn on it space operations, or the 12.6% oper profit margin at Lockhe Martin.That bleak situat got even wors in 2015 when a small reduct in launch revenu suffic to push SpaceX deepli into the red, and forc the compani to record a $260 million loss on $945 million in revenue.What SpaceX hope to earnSpaceX'ssuccess return to spacelast month hold forth the promis that thing will improv in 2017. Prior to the Septemb SpaceXplosion, document show that SpaceX wa target $1.8 billion in launch revenu in 2016, and aim to earn $55 million in profit thereon. While it probabl didn't get there in 2016, there' still a chanc that it could succeed in 2017 -- and achiev a 3% oper profit margin.And that' your answer right there: Currently, all indic suggest that SpaceX isnotprofitable, but lose money. Onli if thing go well, and SpaceX regain it foot in 2017, can we hope that the compani will achiev posit oper profit margin of 3%.Even if SpaceX succe at this, though, it would still be earn onli roughli half the 5.7% oper margin that Airbu earn at it ""Defenc and Space"" busi (a report byS&P Global Market Intelligence). SpaceX' target $55 million profit would also be a small fraction of the $400 million in annual profit that the Boe and Lockhe joint ventur ULAearns. On the other hand, SpaceX would eclips thebreak-even profitsat Airbus' dedic space launch subsidiary, Arianespac -- and SpaceX could grow it profit margin in the futur if it plan to begin reus reland rockets, at lower cost than use ""expendable"" rockets, pan out.SpaceX 2.0: A New HopeSo what' the upshot for SpaceX for investor who hope to one day invest in it IPO, and for investor who already,today, own a piec of SpaceX through their invest inAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock? Simpli put, the document theJournalunearth show that SpaceX is not nearli as profit an oper as we onc believ it to be..There' also a corollari conclusion, though, that affect investor in the space industri in general. Lack substanti profit from it launch business, SpaceX is go to have a veri hard time financ atrip to Mars-- a voyag it hope to makea earli as next year-- and a voyag that could inspir a whole host of other compani to acceler their own race to space.HowdoesSpaceX plan to fund it first trip to Mar in 2018 and the dozen of follow-up trip it hope to make in the year and decad to follow?

1 Thing NVIDIA Investors Should Worry About,2/3/2017,"WhenIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) acquir artifici intellig (AI) start-up Nervana System late last year, at first glanc it appear to be anoth big tech compani jump on the AI bandwagon. A closer look, however, reveal a veri specif motivation. And it could spell troubl for NVIDIA.NVIDIA GPU is the go-to chip to train AI system -- for now. Imag source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Intel ha seen the market for it CPU chip shrink along with the worldwid shipment of person computers, which fell an estim 6% in 2016, the fifth consecut year of declines. CompetitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , meanwhile, ha seen the market explod for it graphic process unit (GPU), along with it stock price, which tripl in 2016.Though onc use sole to render graphic in video games, NVIDIA' GPU have becom the go-to chip fortrain neural networksdu to the massiv parallel process capability. Accord to aFinanci Timesarticl in December, NVIDIA ""i wide credit with have develop the best chip for train the artifici neural networks"". The use of NVIDIA GPU by data center -- mani train AI system -- help revenu nearli tripl in the most recent quarter, to $240 million from just $82 million in the prior year. Intel domin the non-AI data center market, sell nearli 99% of server chip used, and it now ha it sight on the nascent AI market as well.What is Intel doing?Lat last year, Intel announc that it would releas a server chip specif design for AI applic -- the Xeon Phi, aka Knight Mill. It indic thi processor would run 2.3 time faster than NVIDIA' GPU when use for deep learning. NVIDIA countered, say Intel deliber use outdat benchmark and older version of it product in the comparison. It claim that had Intel use the updat benchmark, NVIDIA' offer is 30% faster, and that it latest processor is 90% faster.Intel want to ""unleash the next wave"" in artifici intelligence. Imag source: Intel.Intel' recent acquisit push it deeper into thi market. Nervana System took a differ approach in it AI research. It ha creat an applic specif integr circuit (ASIC) for it AI research call the Nervana Engine. Certain element in a GPU need for graphic process are not necessari in an AI application. By strip out unnecessari element and reengin the memory, Nervana claim it can achiev 10 time increas in the comput power current avail on GPUs. In an articl from Octob 2015,Barron's[subscript required] explained:Their chip ha thousand of littl logic engin sit next to pool of memory, with a plethora of connect between them. They claim the chip can perform in a fraction of the time an image-recognit task that would take an Intel server chip 2,000 hours, or an Nvidia GPU, 33 hours. The key is that they are design for specif algorithms, so the chip' design is more effici than a general-purpos chip like Intel' or NVIDIA's.Nervana Engin ASIC chip are design to acceler AI system training. Imag source: Nervana Systems.Intel will be integr the new technolog into it exist chip in earli 2017, so expect new offer that will directli challeng NVIDIA' GPU in the AI space. Intel also claim that by 2020, it will be abl to train AI system 100 time faster than with today' technology, thoughsomehav deem those goal veri aggressive.It' not the onli oneAnd Intel isn't the onli one claim improv beyond what GPU current accomplish.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl ha been conduct research in the field ofAI for over five years. It announc it ha a Tensor Process Unit -- which is also an ASIC -- capabl of deliv perform that is 10 time faster than ani GPU run today, and that it ha been run TPU in it data center for more than a year. They were also use in the AI system Alpha Go, which recent made headlin bydef mani top rankedGoplayers. Thi provid a degre of confirm of Nervana' claim regard the potenti of such custom circuits.NVIDIA see AI as a billion-dollar opportunity, though data center revenu amount to onli $240 million in it most recent quarter. Intel' revenu from data centers, meanwhile, amount to $4.7 billion in it most recent quarter. Thi illustr that while gain in the market would bare move the needl for Intel, they could be a big mover for NVIDIA. While GPU current hold a command lead in the train of AI systems, that could chang quickli if the technolog advanc claim by Intel came to fruition.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Under it old model, Zillow came up with a price for a fix number of ad impress base on a ZIP code' characteristics.But Rascoff note that the fixed-pric model sometim sold out impress in desir ZIP codes, requir the compani to call up agent to increas ad prices. So now price will be set dynamically, base on the total dollar agent budget to advertis on Zillow in a given ZIP code.Th goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determin ad costs, Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which report fourth-quart earn on Tuesday, advis analyst on it Novemb call that it guidanc carri an extra margin of error becaus of the nationwid rollout of the new price strategy.Analyst expect the compani to earn 11 cent a share vs. a one-c loss a year ago, as revenu rise 31% to $222 million. In 2017 revenu is expect to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.Smal Number, But Bigger SpendingTh number of agent advertis on Zillow declin modestli in the third quarter to 89,147, but that wa part of a plan shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertis spend at least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while averag spend per agent rose 46%.IBD' TAKE:Zillow share show promis in earli December, after form acup-with-handleand start to break out.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice,2/2/2017,"Googl Earn (Shutterstock photo)A a gener rule, the market is pretti good about learn from it mistakes. After all, there is noth like a hefti loss to teach trader what not to do.That is a simpl fact that must be born in mind when look for pattern in pricing; if the pattern involv a reaction to news that wa ultim proven wrong, it is unlik to repeat veri often, and the few opportun when it doe should be grab with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what make Googl parent compani Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after it reaction to Q4 earnings.A you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’ earn report Googl (I’m sorri but I just can’t bring myself to call the compani “Alphabet”) had drop sharpli on earn miss contain in two of the previou three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportun to buy the stock at a discount. There are differ circumst thi time around, of course, but the dynam that ha made neg reaction to earn in the past opportun is still in place, so the end result is like to be the same.Th biggest problem with the Q4 result as far as trader were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click wa down, and oper cost had risen to the point where earn per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’ estim of around $9.64. Still, revenu of $26.06 billion beat the estim $25.26 billion.Ther wa also a concern lurk in the background regard Googl take on both Amazon (AMZN)’ Echo and Appl (AAPL)’ iPhon with recent hardwar launches. Googl said that they were pleas with the reaction to both Googl Home and the Pixel phone without go into specifics, but doubt about the wisdom of the strategi persist.I actual believ that Googl ha a chanc of limit success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphil struggl as the iPhone’ domin of the mobil phone market is well established. Most estim of sale of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardli put a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profit as a nich product.Hom ha an easier, more logic path to success as Googl is the natur choic of those look for what is, essentially, a free-stand search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is go to be the driver of the recoveri in the stock price that histori suggest will come soon.First, the increas in oper cost that Googl report seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of invest in the core business. Loss in what the compani call “Other Bets,” thing like “Nest” and self drive cars, were actual reduc somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there wa signific progress on the autonom vehicl front.Th possibl of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are gener seen as the leader in driverless car research and technology.Th other issue, of fall cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seem on the surface. It reflect a continu move to mobil that result in that metric falling, but the volum of click increasing. The same issu was, in part, respons for the April and Octob drop in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tell the stori of how long it wa until investor realiz that volum more than offset fall CPC.Look at Google’ result and the market reaction to them, I get a sens of déjà vu. We have actual been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investor a chanc to buy cheaply. It seem that in thi case the market is still learn from it mistak and over time the outcom here is most like to be the same."

Notably, Vinh cite AMD as benefit from ""strength in game and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analyst also said the improv in high-end PC could reduc concern about high-end GPU inventori at desktop graphic card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD' graphic chips, which saw revenu grow 15% year-over-year.Th Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphic Process Unit, is a big busi for AMD. Those chip render images, anim and video for display on computer' screens. And the strength of that busi ha been a key compon of AMD' turnaround.

But the big news is that Facebook is about to challeng the video leagu leader with a mobil app for exist stream box like theAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will thi do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMov into TV through an app rather than a devic make sense, given the failur of the origin Facebook phone and it overwhelm success with app for others' phones.FB is alreadi bankrol the creation of video for the video tab of itsmobil app.So where doe Facebook fit it servic into the evolv market, and what doe it presenc as a broadcast mean to it claim not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneTh compani is alreadi a presenc in video thank toFacebook Live, which allow live stream of video on the servic and it ha aPresidenti endorsement.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatFB ha prepar to offer longer video by introduc ""mid-roll"" ad - ad that play in the middl of a video - to it line-up, make the servic more TV-like.Ov time, thi might allow Facebook to compet directli withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTub in the grow market for stream services.Th problem is that there is a big differ between the experi you get on a mobil phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support video of a few minutes, while peopl will watch TV for hours-and-hours.Ther is an assumpt in the breathless report of Facebook' latest move that TV is easy; that it' just someth you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in gener subscrib and Emmys, and Amazon in gener Prime member and Oscar buzz, that is an easi mistak to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, thi may not be as huge a deal as analyst think.Netflix revenu is onli a fraction of FB stock's. Analyst expect Facebook to deliv over $27 billion in 2016 revenu when it report after the market close Feb. 1. Thi is against roughli $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also bring just 3% of that revenu to the bottom line, while FB stock bring nearli one-third of revenu to it net incom line.Ent the world of creat televis pose anoth risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ha repeatedli saidh doesn't run a media company, that hi is just a commun service. Media compani have respons to truth and accuraci that, say, phone compani don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is go to licens content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becom a media company, subject to polit and public scrutini for it program choices, on a global basis. Thi is a danc FB stock sharehold should fear, becaus it cost money to play, and carri risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choic in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it' where everyon is heading. FB stock doe not want to be left behind.Th Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhil most analyst are jump for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. Thi move ha enorm implic for the entir company, for how it' perceiv and (more important) what it cost to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefer to manag itself through algorithms. Algorithm scale in way peopl do not. Facebook is start to bow to pressur on the media front,hir Campbel Brownto coordin media alliances. Now it' about to becom a TV network, or at least a stream service.What will that mean to it profit and growth?

And half of those are either differ color option or region variat of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radic differ approach with it Echo speaker and Alexa. The compani openli court third-parti compani to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-en interact with an Amazon Alexa-pow device.A skill can be the abil to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be tell Alexa to turn on your home' smart light or to start your electr car. The process is simple. Amazon provid an exampl showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includ the time need to creat a develop account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it' published.That' how Amazon Alexa tripl it avail skill in just three month last year, hit 3,000 in September. If that sound impressive, by CE 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addit to skills, Amazon also encourag third parti to integr Alexa function into their products. That way, consum get the Alexa experi without requir an Echo speaker.That' a far easier process than Appl HomeKit certification. A ""Work with Alexa"" label take about 10 day to obtain (it can even be issu by third parti labs) and doesn't requir special chips. Accord to the Reuter post, that ha result in over 250 product that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, includ third-parti speaker with Alexa and even home applianc with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Appl Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityTh differ approach of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidli leap to a massiv lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where thi could chang rapidly.Secur is increasingli becom an issu for smart, connect devices. Apple' HomeKit approach emphas security, to the point of forc the use of special chip and even certifi manufactur facilities.Amazon' Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leav it platform rel exposed. Amazon told Reuter it can't guarante the secur of third-parti devic run Alexa. Those thousand of Alexa skill also integr with third-parti servic that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trad of the Day: Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAl it would take is one catastroph hack for a PR disast that turn consum off Alexa. As CNET put it in a review of thehack risk for differ smart home standards: ""Don't assum that a devic ha high secur standard just becaus it work with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere' no disput the fact that Amazon complet caught Appl and other off guard with it stealthi approach of sneak Alexa into the home use it Echo connect speaker.Befor the Echo, it wa gener assum that a smartphon would be the natur smart home controller. Make Alexa integr so open ha also paid off for AMZN, result in a formid lead in the smart home in a veri short time. That lead may well turn into complet domin of the connect home. But Amazon' open approach may also prove to be it Achil heel.Should hacker turn their attent to Amazon Alexa, the result headlin may flip the equat and put the much more secur Appl HomeKit on top in the long run.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future,2/1/2017,"When you regularli give your opinion on someth as unpredict as financi markets, gloat when you get someth right is rare a good idea. That is especi true when those opinion arearchivedfor all to see; it' too easi for a reader to check out that archiv and find exampl of when the market and hindsight combin to make even logic argument seem foolish. I am fulli awar of that, but when it come to yesterday’searn releas from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What realli matter about the Appl releas to investor is certainli not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant return to growth in revenu for the first time in a year, nor that the alreadi great margin at Appl increased. Those last two are important, but necessarili backward looking, as all hard data in an earn releas are by definition.What matter most is what the report tell us about the futur and there the messag wa somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();Th offici guidanc for Q1 2017 contain in the releas fell just short of Wall Street’ expectations, which would normal be enough of a neg to more than offset the good histor results. In thi case, though, a look at where Appl succeed in Q4 2016 suggest that that guidanc may just be anoth exampl of Apple’ past tendenc to err on the side of under-promis and over-deliv when it come to guidance. That is why, even though growth stall last year, AAPL ha beaten EP expect in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhon sale hit anoth record. That is particularli signific as not that long ago mani were predict that Googl parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’ move into the phone busi would do Appl some seriou harm. It look now as if those say that were about as accur as those that maintain that the Window phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.Th fact is that the iPhon ha an icon statu that look almost imposs to challenge. Even phone that are object better in some ways, such as memori capacity, camera resolution, or speaker qualiti for example, cannot take market share. As Appl advanc the iPhon with each release, beat them on those and other front becom harder, but remains, accord to the evid so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynam remains, hold Appl stock and ad to hold at time of weak still make sens for investors.Th weak in thi releas wa mainli in one area; iPad sale declin for the twelfth success quarter. That, however, wa offset to some extent by strong sale of Mac and Appl Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Appl doesn’t releas a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I point out in the articl referenc above, anybodi who tri to buy a Seri Two watch as a Christma gift is probabl awar that sale were at least more than Appl expected. None were avail in ani of the five state where I tri and most store have just now receiv inventory.That shortag of watches, combin with Cook’ admiss that they serious underestim demand for the iPhon 7 Plus, mean that the record sale report yesterday were achiev with a background of suppli constraints. Given that and the fact that there wa consider growth in area such as servic and enterpris oper that still have lot of room for Appl to expand, the messag underli yesterday’ earn is that, despit convent wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview",2/1/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA it' customari withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant top analysts' expect in each of the first three quarter of 2016. Chanc are that it'll top expect onc more when it report it fourth-quart and full-year 2016 figur on Feb. 2. So if you'r follow AMGN stock, you don't need to worri about Amgen' profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Mason via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the follow item Thursday when Amgen report it fourth-quart results:#1: Enbrel Sale TrendCompar to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen report flat product sale in Q3 2016. Thi wa mostli due to it top-sel drug, Enbrel, lose ground. Sale for the drug had increas 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sale were $1.452 billion, versu $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.Th problem doesn't seem to be season fluctuation, consid that Enbrel sale grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compar to Q3 2014.7 Aw Stock You Need To Ditch Right AwayTh problem is that competit is catch up. Amgen usual says, ""offset partial by the impact of competition"" when give detail about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" wa conspicu absent. Did someon just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Mayb not.AMGN stock holder should pay attent to see if Enbrel will resum growth through increas volume, as oppos to price hike.Enbrel face three major growth barriers.First, it compet againstAbbVi Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson' Remicade. Thi lead to the second challenge.Stiff competit necessit increment rebat to payer to maintain it formulari position.Th third challeng is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA ha approv Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovarti AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lacklust Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen' Drug PricingInvestor also should look close at how fast Amgen is hike prices.I rais concern about Amgen stockgrow sale by increas drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the compani report it Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two year on, the trend of grow sale with price hike is still commonplac at AMGN.From a busi perspective, it' smart to tri to squeez out everi possibl dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. govern is stand up against it. Presid Donald Trump told drugmak in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the price down.""Thi won't be good for the top and bottom line of ani drugmaker. However, for a compani who thrive on hike drug price like AMGN, the downsid get bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is herald as potenti one of Amgen' best sellers. The compani said the drug cater to ""seriou diseas with signific unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payer have employ utilization-manag procedures, which limit patients' abil to gain access to Repatha. Exec said dure Q3 earn call that they'r work with payer and provid to allow unlabel patient access. Investor should look to see if collabor with payer and provid are yield signific Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowTh drug, which current compet withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceut Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescript (NBRx) in Q4, accord to an Amgen present at thi year' JPMorgan Healthcar Conference. Still, AMGN stock holder probabl want to know just how much in sale that amount to.But it ha to be note that an ongo court case that Amgen file against Sanofi and Regeneron onpat infringementground is tip the scale in Rapatha' favor for now.Finally, investor should pay attent to see if low expens is continu and will continu at Amgen. Sinc the begin of 2015, AMGN ha reduc it total expens by roughli 3.7% to 13.22%. Keep expens low will be critic to futur profitability, especi in Trump' recent focu on drugmakers.Earn apart, I believ the uncertainti surround the futur make AMGN stock less attractive.A of thi writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAppl Inc.

The team rank eight global technolog compani base on their involv across 22 cutting-edg categories. Hand down, Alphabet rank No. 1, captur 21 of 22.Innov LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlight compani have dedic effort in the area of artifici intelligence, big data and cloud services, make these three the Holi Grail of innovation.Th first two come as no surprise, as data gather and analysi are critic to predict behavior, enabl compani to target consum accordingly.

By ""killing"" more project than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and develop - the second highest number of ani compani in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentag of sale among the eight innov leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invest a stagger amount of money to fund R&D, both becaus it can and becaus it ha to. With three time more onlin advertis than it next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.Bi the same token, it ha signific overlap with all seven competitor in the most obviou categori - like robot and AI- and each of these compani is hungri to dominate.There' no let up in thi crowd. Innov or die.What' GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compar the growth we'r get (earnings) with the price we'r pay (price-to-earnings, or P/E). Thi is call a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it' an intuit way to compar appl to apples.Us 2017 consensu estim track by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tuck right in the middl of the pack. It PEG ratio is 1.08. PEG below 1 are cheap, and PEG approach 2 are expensive.PEG ratio are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).

Keep in mind that - for the past five quarter - the compani ha beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.FB Stock Still Face Sever RisksBut the real potenti issu for Facebook stock is ani disappoint commentari on the futur growth trends. Interestingli enough, on the Q3 earn call, the company' CFO had thi omin thing tosay: ""We continu to expect that revenu growth rate will declin in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015.

Is Voice Search an Opportunity or a Threat to Google?,1/31/2017,"Imag source: Google.Consum are do more and more web search just by talking. And they'r not just ask the digit assist on their smartphones; they'r also buy all-new devices, such as theAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Googl Home, to answer random queries.makeArticleAd();For Google, the subsidiari ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a double-edg sword. On one hand, it provid anoth point for user to interact with it product. On the other, Googl doesn't have a stranglehold on the devic market, and it isn't clear how compani can monet voic search with ads.Even as Googl navig the shift to mobile, it still fundament follow the same busi model -- display ad within search results. That' not possibl with voic searches.But Googl CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more opportun than challenge, when I think about voic search,"" he told analyst on the company' fourth-quart earn call. I wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.Los the hardwar battleGoogl didn't provid ani exact figur on the sale of it new Googl Home device. Pichai did say that ""Googl Home wa a veri popular present that mani peopl open on Christma morning,"" but that wa as detail as he got.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggest that Googl is get outsold 10-to-1 by competitor such as Amazon Echo. That present a real challeng for Google, becaus without control over the hardware, it ha no control over the user interface. That mean all those potenti voic search will go to someon else.Pichai point out that it' the veri earli day for devic such as Googl Home. And Googl doe have one big advantag over Amazon and other competitor -- it' much better at search. ""When I look at what it would take to voic search well, our year of progress we have done in area like natur languag process come into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To hi credit, Googl Home ha outperform Alexain manyhead-to-head searchreviews.But smart-speak hardwar is about more than search, and Amazon' Echo is capabl of integr with more devic and servic than Googl Home is. Googl is certainli capabl of overcom that through more strateg partnerships, though. It just releas a develop kit for busi to integr with Googl Home last month.On area that will be harder to overcom is how well Amazon Echo work for Amazon Prime members. With ten of million of Prime member around the world, it creat a pretti big moat for Googl Home to cross.But wait -- it get tougherEven if Googl close the gap in hardwar sales, it still ha to find a way to turn voic search into a business. Hardwar sale won't move the needl for Alphabet, which gener over $90 billion in revenu last year.What' more, Googl ha to sell the hardwar near cost becaus it biggest competitor, Amazon, doe the same. The margin on a Googl Home devic don't even come close to Google' 31% oper margin in the fourth quarter.If Googl is go to make some real money off of voic search, it need to go beyond just get it devic into people' homes. Google' best idea so far is tofacilit commerc through voic search. But if there' one compani that ha Google' number in e-commerc search, it' Amazon. Googl will not win a battl against Amazon in develop a person shop assistant, no matter how good it search capabl are.Not just a challeng -- a threatTh growth of voic isn't just a challeng for Google. The shift to voic repres a threat, as it could result in a declin in the amount consum use Googl search, the company' cash cow.Googl is work to overcom the head start Amazon got in smart speakers, which acceler the voic search trend. It plan to expand it hardwar lineup and invest more in 2017. But as voic search continu grow and start take search away from mobil and desktop, it will put pressur on Googl to continu develop new higher-valu display and search ad for it main desktop and mobil products.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Quot unnam sources, she say that the mysteri Window 10 Cloud is a new, simplifi version of Microsoft Window that will run onli Unifi Window Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it' a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Window 10.You might also think of it as anoth crack at Window RT …Window RT? But Why?Everyon rememb the mess that wasWindow RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Window onto a consum tablet run ARM chip -the ill-fat Surfac RT - veri nearli dealt MSFT' tablet aspir a fatal blow.However, despit the failur of Window RT, Microsoft ha never given up on the idea of Window on ARM chips.

There are two reasons.Th first is that dream of ""Window everywhere.""

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story,1/31/2017,"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotenti undervaluedgrowth play in a frothi market. The social network app maker post eye-pop number last quarter -- 32% annual growth in monthli activ user (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and 30% non-GAAP earn growth.Analyst expect MeetMe' revenu and non-GAAP earn to respect rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trade at just 7 time trail earn and 10 time forward earnings. Let' take a look at the five key reason investor aren't buy MeetMe' growth story, despit it high growth figur and low valuations.MeetMe' mobil app. Imag source: Googl Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubl histori with sexual predatorsMeetM let user find new peopl in their area to chat with, similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there' noth inher sinist about the app, there have been multipl report of MeetM be use by sexual predators.In 2014, the Citi of San Francisco su MeetM for the unlaw public of minors' profiles, photos, and geoloc data, and claim that the app ""enabled"" sexual predat to find their victims. The citi cite sever case involv adult men and minor in which MeetM wa used. MeetM settl the case for $200,000 the follow year, agre to clarifi and simplifi it user agreement and settings, and reduc the amount of data display on minor to their citi and state.But the case involv MeetM didn't ceas -- last February, a Buffalo man wa charg with multipl count of child pornographi after use MeetM to find minors. MeetMe' troubl rais red flag at Tinder, which hike it age limit from 13 to 18 last June. Yet MeetM still hasn't follow suit, presum becaus it would lose a larg portion of it users.2. The potenti loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big compani would be reluct to advertis on MeetMe, but plenti of big brand still advertis on the app. That' becaus MeetM gener most of it ad revenu from programmat ad deliv byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.Thi mean that MoPub' custom simpli pick a demograph -- in MeetMe' case, younger user and Millenni -- and the platform feed the ad to variou apps. Thi mean that mani compani probabl don't realiz that their ad are appear on MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesi is that MoPub could decid to drop MeetM due to violat of it term of service, or advertis could ask MoPub to pull their ad from the controversi app. There' no evid either of these scenario will occur, but it rais a troubl question -- if MeetMe' reput worsens, can it still keep grow it ad revenues?3. Be boot from the app storesIn it 10-K file for fiscal 2015, MeetM admit that it busi will suffer if it is ""unabl to maintain a good relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet' Google. It note that it app could be pull from their app store ""if we violate"" or the compani believ ""that we have violated"" their term and conditions.Th bull might believ that' just a typic ""risk factor"" warning, but MeetM admit in the same file that ""on more than one occasion,"" Appl reject it app ""becaus of user gener content and other concerns."" Thi indic that anoth high-profil lawsuit could knock MeetM out of the app store and kill it business.4. Tinder is crush MeetMeMeetM arriv befor Tinder, which wa initi launch in 2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetM wane in correl with Tinder' growth, as seen in thi chart from Googl Trends:Imag source: Google.That declin also explain whi MeetM acquir it competitor Skout last October. That move boost the company' MAU count from about 5 million to 8.5 million, and greatli inflat MeetMe' top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insid confidenceIf MeetM is as undervalu as the fundament suggest, you'd expect insid to be load up on shares. However, MeetM CEO Geoffrey Cook just sold 250,000 share (16% of hi entir position) at an averag price of $5.02.Includ Cook' sales, insid sold 1.96 million share over the past 12 months, but onli bought 334,000 shares. It' understand that MeetMe' insid would sell after the stock' 50% ralli over the past 12 months, but it also indic that it upsid potenti could be limited.Th key takeawayTh main lesson here is to alway look beyond the valuat and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetM look like a rapidli grow social app maker trade at a discount to it peers. But dig deeper, and you'll see an app that' struggl to prove that it' not a tool for crimin while remain relev against Tinder, which domin the space with over 50 million activ users.10 stock we like better than MeetMeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons I'm Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR) Stock,1/31/2017,"Chines search giantBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) is often dismiss as a slow-growth tech stock that ha run out of room to grow. It heavi invest in expand it ecosystem into adjac market have weigh down it bottom line growth, make the stock seem like dead money. Despit those challenges, however, I recent start a new posit in Baidu for four main reasons.Baidu Imag Search. Imag source: Author' screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. It' still the 800-pound gorillaBaidu control roughli 80% of the internet search market in China. That domin posit enabl it to expand it ecosystem in the same way asAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. It sprawl ecosystem now includ Baidu Maps, video stream site iQiyi, it Duer voic assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numer portal sites, and variou O2O (online-to-offline) servic in it ""monolithic"" mobil app.Whil the profit of these servic vari greatly, they all help Baidu gather data from it user for target ads. Last quarter, Baidu' revenu per onlin market custom rose 10.6% annually. Thi indic that Baidu still remain a top advertis pick in China, even as other popular app -- likeTencent' WeChat -- tether more user to their ecosystems. Moreover, China still ha an internet penetr rate of just 52%, which mean that there may be plenti of room for all these compani to expand without step on each other' toes.2. It slowdown is temporaryBaidu fell out of favor with growth investor as it top and bottom line growth seemingli dri up. Last quarter, it revenu fell 0.7% annually, it core onlin market revenu slid 6.7%, and it non-GAAP net incom rose just 6.3%. Analyst expect it revenu to rise 6% thi year, but for it earn to declin 9%.However, that slowdown wa mainli caus by three temporari headwinds. First, Chines regul forc Baidu to remov mislead pharmaceut ad follow the death of a student who bought unapprov cancer drug advertis on the site. Second, Baidu sold it stake in onlin travel agencyQunarto it rivalCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , essenti swap it stake in Qunar for one in Ctrip but temporarili throttl revenu growth.Lastly, Baidu' heavi invest in R&D are squeez it margins, but launch new servic could boost it long-term growth and widen it moat against rival like Tencent. That' whi analyst believ that Baidu' revenu and earn will respect rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017.3. Growth potenti in next-gen marketsLik Google, Baidu is invest heavili in artifici intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies. Machin learn and AI have becom increasingli import to search and advertis companies, sinc they help gather more data from user to creat target ad that user are more like to click on. Baidu ha been hire a lot of top talent in that field -- it chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previous led the Googl Brain AI project, and it new augment realiti chief Qi Lu wa aMicrosoftexec special in AI.To showcas it AI efforts, Baidu pit it AI robot against Google' AlphaGo AI in a battl of facial and voic recognit in earli January. It partner withNVIDIAand HERE Map to develop map system for autonom vehicles, and plan to launch a driverless shuttl bu in China in 2018. It also partner with smart remot maker Peel to establish a foothold in the grow smart home market. These project won't gener meaning revenu for years, but they could greatli expand Baidu' O2O ecosystem over the long term.4. The stock is still cheapBaidu current trade at just 13 time earnings, which is much lower than Google' P/E of 31 and the industri averag of 50 for internet inform providers. But due to it project declin in earn thi year, the stock ha a forward P/E of 30. While that forward multipl doesn't seem cheap, we should rememb that Baidu' earn are expect to rebound in 2017.The key takeawayBaidu will like remain weigh down by near-term challeng over the next few quarters, but it' still well-posit to profit from the long-term growth of the Chines internet market. Baidu may struggl to pull social user away from Tencent and shopper away fromAlibaba, but it domin of the search-bas ad market won't end anytim soon.10 stock we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
