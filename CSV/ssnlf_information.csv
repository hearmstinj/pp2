This Chipmaker Could Benefit From Qualcomm, Inc.'s Data Center Assault;3/17/2017;"Wireless chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is making a pretty big push into the market for   data center chips. Data center chips aren't sold in anywhere near   the volumes that Qualcomm's bread-and-butter smartphone   processors are, but the potential average selling prices as well   as gross profit margin potential per chip are quite a bit better   than a typical smartphone processor.Qualcomm has said that its Centriq 2400 server chip, which   packs 48 of the company's Falkor processor cores, is manufactured   on a foundry 10-nanometer processor. Qualcomm hasn't specified   which of the two companies currently in production on   10-nanometer technologies --Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) -- is building the chip, but thanks to a   report from DigiTimes, we know who the winner is.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();And the winner is...PerDigiTimes, citing a report from Commercial Times, says that it's Taiwan   Semi that's building the Centriq 2400 for Qualcomm. In fact, not   only is TSMCsetto build the Centriq 2400 for Qualcomm, but the report says that   the chips are in mass production now.This might come as a bit of a surprise to some considering   that Qualcomm is having Samsung build its 10-nanometer Snapdragon   835 smartphone chips, but perhaps the fact that Qualcomm isn't   trying to sell these chips to Samsung may have given it a bit   more liberty when deciding which manufacturer to work with on the   Centriq 2400.Near-term and longer-term implicationsIn the near term, I don't see the Centriq 2400 driving   game-changing levels of chip volume or, ultimately, revenue into   TSMC's coffers, although incremental leading-edge technology   revenue and wafer shipments are always good. As Iwrote previously, I expect that it'll take time for Qualcomm to take significant   share in the data center market, if it ultimately does so.Over the longer term, TSMC could be one of the prime   beneficiaries should the ARM server ecosystem -- of which   Qualcomm is a very prominent member -- take the kind of server   share that ARM had told its investors (back when it was a   publicly traded company) it aspired to take (roughly 25% of the   market).Indeed, TSMC has been consistently highlighting   ""high-performance computing"" (HPC) applications as attractive   long-term growth opportunities beyond the core mobile chip   market. Such markets demand performance and features, which means   that potential customers are likely to be more willing to pay up   to use TSMC's most advanced manufacturing technologies.TSMC will, of course, face indirect competition from   microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , the incumbent player in the data center   processor market and a company that manufactures its own chip,   and it will need to deal with rival contract chip manufacturerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for chip orders from the designers of these   chips for HPC applications.However, TSMC's success in the high end of the mobile   applications processor market, its strong technology execution,   as well as its history as the key manufacturer of FPGA, graphics,   and networking processor chips for other client, should position   it well to capture ARM server processor business.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Cypress Semiconductor Could Benefit From the Next iPhone;3/17/2017;"Image source: Cypress Semiconductor.makeArticleAd();Cypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) shares have gained more than 17% this year thanks   mostly to strong fourth-quarterresultsreleased in early February, with the semiconductor specialist   trading close to its 52-week highs as of this writing.Cypress, however, is not done yet, as recent rumors regardingApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhone suggest that its business could get   a big shot in the arm.A design win would be a big dealThe Wall Street Journalhas reported that insiders said Apple is going to ditch the   Lightning connector for a USB-C port in the next iPhone. Though   there is a precedent for the company using USB-C in the MacBook   line, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes otherwise. The KGI   Securities analyst reportedly said in a research note obtained byAppleInsiderthat Apple could use ""Type-C power delivery"" for all the upcoming   iPhones this year instead of ditching the Lightning port   altogether in favor of USB-C.It makes sense for Apple to use Type-C power delivery through   the existing Lightning port instead of moving to the USB-C   standard, as the former is good enough to enable fast-charging on   the iPhone. The additional advantage of using USB-C is high-speed   data transmission, but Kuo points out that this is a niche   application for iPhone users, so he thinks Apple will stick to   the existing standard.Additionally, Kuo's comments seem credible because Apple has a   whole line of Lightning accessories under the MFi program on   which it makes money. The company reportedly gets a fee of around   10% of the wholesale cost of an accessory made under this   program. For example, an Apple-certified Lightning to USB cable   costs around $6 at the minimum, so, that would give Apple 60   cents on the sale of each unit.But whatever the case may be, the next iPhone looks to be a   catalyst for Cypress. Investment research provider Needham &   Company estimates that the semiconductor specialist's earnings   could increase by $0.11 to $0.19 per share on revenue gains of   $87.5 million to $157.5 million during the next iPhone cycle if   Apple ditches Lightning for a USB-C port. By comparison, Cypress'   adjusted earnings last quarter were $0.15 per share on revenue of   $530 million.Even if Apple decides to continue using the Lightning port   with Type-C power delivery, Kuo believes that Cypress will win a   spot to supply power delivery chips to enable this technology.   Cypress is a leading provider of Type-C controllers with $295   million worth of design wins in this market, so it could be on   its way to take advantage of the next iPhone's upgraded charging   technology.Cypress previous supplied only components for Apple   accessories, such as a programmable chip for the AirPods.   Therefore, a spot in the next iPhone would be a big win for it as   the Cupertino-based smartphone giant is expected  to make   250 million to 350 million units of the device.Moreover, a closer look at the company's fourth-quarter   conference call transcript (viaSeeking Alpha) reveals that Cypress might be gearing up for the iPhone   production ramp-up in the second half of the year. In response to   a question, Cypress CEO Hassane El-Khoury said:But if you look at the market for Type-C, the expectation     from my side is, that ramp is going to happen in the second     half of 2017, and that's really a typical design-in behavior.     So we will see slight growth in the March quarter, but     primarily would expect us to grow much harder in the second     half.A potential Galaxy S8 bonusApple might not be the only one driving growth in Cypress'   Type-C controllers. Needham expects theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S8 to come equipped with USB-C charging   capabilities. This isn't surprising as this charging standard is   fast replacing the micro USB in Android smartphones.Leaked images of the Galaxy S8 indicate that the Korean   smartphone will indeed come with a USB-C port and Cypress has   been a longtime component supplier to Samsung, so a USB-C port   win in the next flagship device is quite likely.As things stand, Needham expects Samsung to sell somewhere   between 30 million and 60 million Galaxy S8 devices, with Cypress   getting dollar content of $1 to $1.50 in each phone. This puts   its potential revenue from the next Samsung flagship in the range   of $30 million to $90 million, with earnings coming in between   $0.04 and $0.10 per share.Cypress Semiconductor seems on track for two big smartphone   design wins this year that could substantially enhance its   financial performance.10 stocks we like better than Cypress     SemiconductorWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Still Has More Room to Run;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWithout a doubt,Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of the revelations of the markets last year. Micron stock blasted naysayers with a blistering 53% return. That went a long way in eliminating the foul taste of 2015, when MU hemorrhaged 59% of equity value. Better yet, the momentum is still strong.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Deal via FlickrYear-to-date, Micron stock is looking at an 18% return. If it can maintain this rate, it will easily pull a repeat of 2016's incredible run.Of course, that's a bigif, but the fundamentals are supportive. As InvestorPlace writer and IPO playbook editorTom Taulli notes, the ""biggest driver for MU is the supply-and-demand situation."" The excess supply of computer chips that killed sales for semiconductors in recent years has eased considerably.Also, the competitive environment for Micron stock is quite favorable. Only a handful of rivals directly impede MU stock, includingSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andSK Hynix Inc(OTCMKTS:HXSCL). Unlike old western movies, this town is more than big enough for all of them, at least for now.The question now is, when the next big headwind comes storming in, will Micron stock be ready? More pointedly, will investors stay patient enough to find out?Lingering Doubts Exist for Micron stockAs great as the MU stock rally was last year, it doesn't completely erase the misery of 2015. A 59% loss in the markets requires a 144% profit to breakeven. The quick math works out like this: 100% ÷ (100% - 59%).7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsAs mentioned before, Micron stock managed 53% in 2016, which is obviously well off the breakeven point. This math exercise also demonstrates the significance of money management, especially for volatile investments.Click to EnlargeFurthermore, even with last year's victory, MU stock is behind for the decade in terms of annual returns.In the last seven years, Micron stock has three good years, but four bad years. Now the average haul is a very encouraging 32%. Still, investors have had to go on a ride to get their share of the glory. What bulls and bears can agree on is that MU stock is not a stock for the squeamish.Finally, a split dynamic in thederivatives markethas left semiconductor traders on tenuous ground. Short interest increased forIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC),Applied Materials, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMAT) and especiallyQualcomm, Inc(NASDAQ:QCOM). It decreased forAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD),Broadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron stock.On paper, MU looks like a crapshoot. However, that doesn't mean it will stay that way.MU Stock Will Look More ConvincingFirst, I think potential buyers should take a small bit of encouragement from the options traders. Yes, big semiconductors are split evenly in terms of sentiment. However, they collectively chose Micron as belonging to the better half of the equation. Since option traders typically have their fingers on the trigger, it's safe to assume that they absorb the latest news with aggressive vigor.Does the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacle Signal Doom for These Unicorns?On the other hand, traders can be wrong, and sometimes, painfully so. That's why I like to see if there are confirming fundamentals. In MU's last earnings report, the company returned to profitability after three consecutive quarters of droughts. More importantly, Micron stock received an upgrade by Zacks Investment Research to a ""strong buy."" This shift was due to a sizable lift in earnings-per-share expectations.But the biggest draw for MU stock is its technical trend line. Since November of last year, shares have charted a distinct pattern of higher highs and higher lows. This pattern has also occurred above Micron stock's 50- and 200-day moving averages. No sign of weakness exists, apart from the daily ebb and flow of market trading.The real test for Micron will come when it releases its second-quarter results next week. But given the technical enthusiasm for MU, as well as the company's own expectations, I think anything other than a long play is a risky one. It's an old adage but it's still very much relevant - you don't want to fight the tape.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe postMicron Technology, Inc.

Those chips are expected   to be manufactured in TSMC's new 10-nanometer manufacturing   technology.However, a new report from Korean publication ETNews claims   that Samsung is ""expecting that it can recover Apple's foundry   supplies that were taken by Taiwan's TSMC by operating 7-nano   production lines.""Samsung's apparent hunger to win back business from TSMC is a   clear risk to the latter.A12 probably isn't at risk, but what about A13?Samsung went into mass production on its 10-nanometer LPE in   the fourth quarter of 2016 and has publicly said that it expects   to begin volume production of the follow-on to this technology,   known as 10-nanometer LPP, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Samsung has said that it aims to begin mass production of its   7-nanometer technology in 2018, and given the schedules around   10-nanometer LPE/LPP, I'd guess that Samsung is aiming forlate2018 production start for its 7-nanometer technology.What this suggests is this: TSMC is unlikely to be at risk of   losing A12 business to Samsung as the latter's 7-nanometer   technology will be too late to market to support the A12, while   TSMC has indicated that it plans to begin mass production on its   7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018.It's the potential A13 business that could be at risk from an   aggressive push from Samsung.Don't count TSMC out, thoughSamsung seems to be planning some aggressive technical moves   with its 7-nanometer technology -- it'sreportedly planningto move to a new transistor structure called a Gate-All-Around   (GAA) transistor that promises to allow chipmakers to continue to   make transistors smaller.However, TSMC has indicated that in 2019 it intends to roll   out a performance-enhanced variant of its 7-nanometer   technology.There are a lot of factors that will drive Apple's decisions   of where it plans to manufacture its next-generation A-series   processors -- both business and technical -- so trying to guess   where Apple will build its next-generation processors is   difficult.It's worth noting, though, that TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu said on   the company's Q3 2016 earnings call that he expects TSMC's market   share during the 7-nanometer technology generation will be   ""higher than 10-nanometer"" and that TSMC's aim is for each new   manufacturing technology to enjoy higher market share than the   prior-generation technology.It'd be hard for TSMC to achieve higher market share in the   7-nanometer generation relative to the 10-nanometer generation if   it ends up losing a significant portion of Apple's business to   Samsung. This leads me to believe that TSMC is confident that it   can maintain its sole-source position at Apple, but only time   will tell if that confidence is deserved.10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor   ManufacturingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Apple Should Be Scared of This Company;3/12/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) reign at the top of the smartphone market is   under threat. Slowly but steadily, Chinese telecom giant Huawei   has been spreading its wings across key global markets, in a bid   to displace Apple and Samsung from the top of the smartphone   heap.makeArticleAd();Huawei's ambition of becoming the second-largest smartphone   company in the world received a shot in the arm in 2016, as its   smartphone sales increased close to 27% from the year before. In   stark contrast, both Apple's and Samsung's shipments fell 4.3%   over the same period, according toGartner. The strong growth in shipments gave Huawei 8.9% of the   smartphone market in 2016 compared to 7.3% a year ago.By comparison, the market shares of both Apple and Samsung   took a beating. The Cupertino-based smartphone giant's share of   the market fell by 1.5 percentage points to 14.4%, while   Samsung's market share fell by two percentage points to 20.5%.   Huawei, however, has managed to consistently increase its   smartphone shipments, leading to market-share gains:Data sources: Strategy Analytics and Counterpoint Technology     Market Research. Chart by author.Having already occupied the third place in the smartphone   race, the Chinese vendor will now go all out to achieve its lofty   ambitions. In November 2016, the chief executive of Huawei's   consumer business group told Reuters that it wants to become the   second-largest smartphone company in two years. But will it be   able to meet this aggressive target?China and India will be tailwinds for HuaweiThe Chinese company has been seeking growth in its home   market. Last year, Huawei shipped 76.6 million phones in China   and sat in the second place with a market share of 16.4%.   Meanwhile, Apple's Chinese shipments dropped an alarming 23% to   44.9 million units, giving it a single-digit market share of just   9.6%.This means that Huawei has opened a huge gap over Apple in   China, as its smartphone shipments there are up almost 22% in   2016. China will be the key to Huawei's global smartphone   dominance, since it is the world's biggest smartphone market and   accounted for 21% of global shipments last year.What's more, the growing adoption of LTE connections in China   means that smartphone demand in the country will remain strong.   GSMA Intelligence forecasts that China will have 1 billion   4G connections by 2020, compared to 762 million at the end of   2016. The increased adoption of 4G means that customers will need   toupgrade to smartphonesfrom feature phones as they move away from legacy technologies   such as 2G and 3G.On the other hand, Huawei is also looking to make inroads into   the Indian market. Last year, it said that it aims to have 10% of   the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2017. In fact,   Huawei's Indian consumer operations reports directly to the   Chinese headquarters, showing the company recognizes the   importance of this market.This is not surprising as annual smartphone sales in India are   expected to top 200 million units in 2020 (rising from 102   million units last year), making it the world's second-largest   market. If Huawei manages to carve out a 10% share for itself in   India, it can add 20 million units in smartphone sales.This looks like an uphill task since it had just 0.5% of the   Indian market in the first half of 2016. But in September 2016,   Huawei began its smartphone manufacturing operations in India,   and it plans to manufacture 3 million units by the end of 2017.   If it is able to convert all these units into sales this year,   the company's Indian market share will gain respectability.By comparison, Apple is yet to get its manufacturing   operations in India into full swing. Though its manufacturing   partner Wistron has set up a plant in the southern part of the   country, it will only produce around 300,000 to 400,000 units of   the iPhone SE initially. This is a far cry from Huawei's   manufacturing capacity.The secret behind Huawei's growthHuawei has a smart formula to win over customers in big   smartphone markets -- offline sales. In China, Huawei plans to   set up 1,000 stores across all counties, apart from striking   partnerships with distributors and retailers. It also plans to   deploy 460 service stores in 45 nations.Meanwhile, Huawei has partnered with more than 50,000 retail   outlets in India and is going to set up more than 200 service   centers. The company's offline-store strategy for emerging   markets is a smart one, allowing it to gain more eyeballs and   eventually increase sales.In fact, offline sales in markets such as India have been the   key to the success of Chinese smartphone companies, since   customers have been able to touch and feel their phones before   buying. And, just 35% of the Indian population had access to the   internet last year, which could be another reason that Huawei has   been busy opening retail outlets in smaller cities.A similar scenario is unfolding in China, where offline   smartphone sales are gaining momentum. The growing shift toward   offline smartphone sales has encouraged Huawei to drastically   ramp up its company-owned stores.Huawei had bumped its global store count by 116% to 35,000   toward the end of May 2016. The company has further strengthened   its retail presence as it planned to open another 15,000 stores   in 2016 itself. Around half of its stores are on the Chinese   mainland and across the rest of Asia, with the next-largest   fraction in Europe.By comparison, Apple has 491 stores spread across the globe,   and over half of them are in the U.S. What's more, its store   presence in markets such as India and China is negligible   compared to Huawei's. Apple reportedly had 40 stores in China by   the end of June 2016, when Huawei had over 11,000 stores on the   mainland. On the other hand, Apple's plans to open stores in   India have been slowed by regulations, though it might open up   three of them this year.Huawei's strong retail presence is complemented by the   company's strategy of offering both budget and premium   smartphones. The Honor 5C, which some reviewers count among the   top budget phones, costs less than $170 in India at current   exchange rates, placing it way below the global-average   smartphone price of $256.In fact, Huawei also sells feature phones in emerging markets   that cost less than $100. These budget phones help bring   customers to its stores and improve brand awareness. The company   is now gradually moving into the higher segment of the market by   launching more mid-range and premium phones, which should   eventually improve the average selling prices of its phones.Image source: Huawei.The takeawayA strong retail presence and an extensive product portfolio   that covers all segments of the smartphone market have been the   catalysts behind Huawei's growth. In fact, the company's   two-pronged strategy has put it in the limelight, as the value of   its brand grew 28% in 2016 on the back of high-end devices and   marketing campaigns.Apple and Samsung, therefore, have a fierce competitor that   looks capable of breaking into the top two in the smartphone   market.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Hewlett-Packard Company;3/12/2017;"WhenHP(NYSE: HPQ) split withHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) in late 2015, the former seemed more like a   slower-growth income play than the latter. But over the past 12   months, HP shares rallied 55%, outperforming HPE's 46% growth and   the S&P 500's 18% gain.In aprevious article, I highlighted the ways HP evolved its aging PC business while   scaling up and diversifying its printing one. Today, we'll look   at the key growth drivers for HP, and see why the 78-year-old   company's best days could still be ahead.HP's Spectre laptop. Image source: HP.makeArticleAd();1. PC declines have likely bottomedIn January,Gartnerannounced that  worldwide PC shipments fell for the fifth   consecutive year in 2016. That was sour news for PC vendors like   HP, but Gartner expects sales to be nearly flat this year and   rise in 2018 -- indicating that the market has finally bottomed   out.That's because sales of premium ""ultramobile"" devices -- like   Ultrabooks, Macbooks, and 2-in-1 devices -- are expected to rise   and offset declines in ""traditional"" PCs like desktops and   regular notebooks. HP's most recent quarterly report, which   showed Personal Systems (PC) revenue rising 10% annually to    $8.2 billion, reflected that shift -- desktop sales stayed   flat, but notebook sales rose 16% on strong demand for higher-end   convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices. Looking further   ahead,the business could gain another tailwind from rising demand   for VR-ready desktops and notebooks.2. It's scaling up its printing businessLast November, HP announced that  it would acquireSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printing business. That move will help HP   use economies of scale to lower production costs, and is expected   to become accretive in the first full year after the deal closes.   HP also believes that combining the two companies' technologies   will ""reinvent and replace service-intensive copies with superior   multi-function printing.""HP's printing business didn't look great last quarter. Total   printing revenues fell 3% annually to $4.5 billion, due to an 8%   decline in commercial hardware (exacerbated by some products   being shifted to the consumer business) and a 3% drop in supply   sales. However, consumer hardware sales improved 2% -- thanks to   healthy demand for its Sprocket mobile printer.HP's Sprocket mobile printer. Image source: HP.HP's commercial printing business could also perk up once it   installs more high-end 3D printers for enterprise customers. It   shipped its first Multi Jet Fusion printers to Jabil,   Materialise, and Shapeways during the quarter, and CEO Dion   Weisler noted during the conference call that HP was    tracking that progress ""to disrupt the $12 trillion   traditional manufacturing market."" Those new investments, along   with the Samsung acquisition, could considerably strengthen HP's   printing business over the next few years.3. It's all about the bundlesOne of HP's biggest advantages in the enterprise market is its   ability to bundle products together at competitive prices. Last   quarter, HP formed new partnerships with glass and ceramics makerCorningand pharmaceutical giantRoche, both of which now use ""comprehensive"" packages of HP's   notebooks, desktops, and workstations. HP could eventually add 3D   printers to those bundles for customers across the manufacturing   industry.As enterprise spending warms up again, HP could sell more   bundles to big enterprise customers -- which would strengthen   both its PC and printing businesses.4. The stock is cheap, and the company rewards its     shareholdersHP trades at 12 times earnings, which is well below its    industry average of 20. It also trades at 0.6 times sales,   which is also much lower than the industry average of 0.9. HP   also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.1%, which is comfortably   supported by a payout ratio of 33%. That combination of a stable   business, low multiple, and high yield make HP very appealing in   a market filled with overvalueddividend   stocks.HP also clearly intends to return most of its free cash flow   to shareholders. Last quarter, it generated over $700 million in   FCF and spent more than $600 million on buybacks and dividends.   Those moves can boost its earnings, keep valuations low, and   attract additional income investors.The key takeawayThe ""new"" HP is definitely leaner and more focused than the   old one, which included too many moving parts which frequently   canceled out each others' gains. Therefore, I believe that HP's   renewed efforts in the PC and printing markets could make it a   great long-term play at current prices. The stock probably won't   soar anytime soon, but its low valuations and solid dividend make   it a sound investment for conservative investors.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

He had just returned from a trip to Washington after hinting his company might consider a large display panel factory in the U.S. (for TVs), as well as a molding factory.However, Gou did not sound enthused.In addition to echoing Apple CEO Tim Cook's concerns about the lack of a trained, skilled workforce, and noting the entire iPhone supply chain is located in China, Gou has concerns about red tape. He toldNikkei:""I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months' time. Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They'll need to pass bills first, and we'll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first.""In other words, the possibility of Foxconn building an Apple factory here to make iPhones is very low.Made in the USA iPhone Out of Reach … For NowWhat's sometimes forgotten is that a U.S. Apple factoryalreadyexists.

Although it's not exactlychurning outthese computers, and that's a problem AAPL is facing as part of the whole U.S. iPhone concept.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is MUCH More Than RyzenIt turns out that the Texas Apple Factory has faced challenges with having to make its own customized tools and training workers. The situation has been bad enough that some of Apple's engineers are reportedlypushing the company to move production back to China, if and when a new Mac Pro model is released.Who wouldn't want to buy an iPhone with ""Made in the USA"" proudly etched on the back? Unfortunately, economic reality is a big obstacle to this goal.With Apple's Mac Pro experience, Tim Cook's obvious concerns and the latest comments from Foxconn, the possibility of an iPhone manufactured in a U.S. Apple factory seems more distant than ever.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Why Universal Display Corporation Stock Popped 28.6% in February;3/9/2017;"What happenedShares ofUniversal Display Corporation(NASDAQ: OLED) jumped 28.6% in the month of   February, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence, after the OLED specialist announcedstrong fourth-quarter 2016 resultsand encouraging guidance.So whatRevenue for the quarter grew 19.7% year over year, to $74.6   million, and it resulted in a 42.7% increase in net income to   25.8 million. Net income per share also climbed 41%, to $0.55. By   comparison, Wall Street was looking for revenue of just $68.6   million, and earnings of $0.42 per share.IMAGE SOURCE: UNIVERSAL DISPLAY.makeArticleAd();Universal Display's growth was driven by a combination of     higher OLED material sales (up 5%, to $29.2 million), an     increase in royalty and license fees (up 27%, to $43.6     million), and $1.8 million in contract research services     revenue from its acquisition of Adesis last year.But more importantly -- and just asUniversal Display management suggestedlast August -- the company finally saw customers commence     adoption of its next-generation phosphorescent OLED emitter     products. The company also made a $15 million investment in a     Barberton, Ohio, manufacturing plant owned byPPG Industries, which should double commercial production capacity for its     emitters.Now whatUniversal Display also told investors to expect full-year 2017   revenue to be in the range of $230 million to $250 million, or up   15.6% to 25.7% from 2016. That includes a $15 million license fee   increase under Universal Display's long-term deal withSamsungDisplay, and -- if recent supply chain reports prove accurate --   thecontinued adoptionof its flagship materials by other technology behemoths,   includingApple.Of course, Universal Display was quick to note that the OLED   industry is still in its early stages, so there are many   variables that could temporarily stifle that growth.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeaks released ""Vault 7,"" a huge collection of documents that reveal hacking tools used by the CIA. While the dump paints the CIA in an unflattering light, the fallout may well be worse for some of the world's largest tech companies, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA has a long list of iOS exploits it has used to gain access to iPhones. Despite being named along with numerous other giants of tech, the latest WikiLeaks dump actually highlights a key advantage for Apple in particular.And while its aura of security may emerge tarnished, the iPhone may actually come out ahead over the long term thanks to WikiLeaks.What Was in WikiLeaks Vault 7?The latestWikiLeaks dump involves 8,761 documentsoutlining a wide range of CIA hacking tools, including viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojans and remote control systems.In addition there are 14 iOS exploits listed, several dozen Android vulnerabilities and methods for accessing encrypted chats (essentially reading the contentsbeforethey are encrypted by gaining access to the host device).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's not all smartphones, either. The CIA has developedmalware to infect computersrunning macOS, Windows and Linux. It's even capable of turning Samsung Smart TVs on their owners, using them as listening devices to record conversations.This Doesn't Look Good for AppleApple has long positioned itself as a privacy advocate. It has always played up the security of the iPhone and evenrefused an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneused by a shooter in 2015's San Bernardino terrorist attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook released a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""The WikiLeaks Vault 7 release made it clear that iOS wasn't as secure as Apple had thought.How Apple Could Come Out AheadWikiLeaks is bad news for Apple in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hacking of mobile devices and consumer electronics could actually be good news for the company in the long run. Apple quickly went on record as saying many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documentswere already addressed with iOS 10. And it is working to identify and patch any new issues.Apple and Google chose very different strategies when it comes to smartphones. Apple controls every aspect of iOS - its mobile operating system - as well as the hardware. It pushes out new major new iOS versions yearly and update releases (the kind that fix bugs or security issues) on demand. As a result,nearly 80% of all iPhones are currently running iOS 10.Google also releases new versions of Android yearly, but largely relies on smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to approve and push updates. They have little incentive to do so, since lacking the latest Android features could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildly varying assortment of smartphones, updates can often be problematic, leading to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajority are running software released in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddressed most of the issues in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundreds of millions of Android devices that could still be affectedbecause they're running old software. Most iPhone users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assured that Apple's consistent program of releases will address any outstanding issues.Apple has a similar approach with macOS. It updates its Mac computer operating system regularly and pushes out security updates as issues are discovered. With the smart home,Apple takes extreme security measures, including costly custom chips, factory inspections and end-to-end encryption between connected devices. This approach has meant slower adoption for its HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of being far more secure than the competition.As for smart TVs eavesdropping on you, that's just another reason to buy a relatively inexpensive streaming box - like an Apple TV - instead.The Age of Privacy Is OverMany people had been living with a probably naive expectation that everything they did with their smartphone was private and secure, especially when using encrypted apps. The latest WikiLeaks dump should end that notion and leave people watching their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aims to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time this plays out, it's also likely to make it clearer than ever before that some products are more secure than others, and some companies are in a better position to fix any vulnerabilities.Apple may have been named as one of the victims of CIA hacking, but it was quick to respond and quick to make it clear many of the WikiLeaks exploits have already been addressed. Perhaps more importantly, Apple's product strategy puts it in the position to be a leader in offering the most secure devices possible going forward.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Report: MediaTek to Stick With Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. for Premium Chips;3/9/2017;"Per a pre-publication note in DigiTimes, wireless chipmaker   MediaTek -- which is generally viewed as second fiddle to market   leaderQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) -- plans to manufacture its next-generation   flagship mobile processors usingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's(NYSE: TSM) 7-nanometer technology.MediaTek currently produces its flagship Helio X30 chip for   premium smartphones using TSMC's 10-nanometer technology, and it   relies on TSMC to manufacture much, if not all, of the rest of   its smartphone applications processor portfolio as well.Image source: MediaTek.makeArticleAd();That MediaTek is reportedly planning to continue to use TSMC   for future products doesn't come as much of a surprise -- TSMC   and MediaTek seem to have a good working relationship and there   doesn't appear to be much of an incentive for the latter to   abandon the former.What's potentially more interesting is what Qualcomm, which   commands a much more robust position in the premium smartphone   processor market than MediaTek does (by way of reference, a   MediaTek executive recently admitted that the X30 is shaping up   to be acommercial dud), will do in the coming product generation.Where will the next Snapdragon be built?Qualcomm used to manufacture its flagship Snapdragon   processors at TSMC. However, beginning with the Snapdragon   820/821, the former shifted away from the latter and towardSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Qualcomm is continuing to work with Samsung to build its   flagship chips, with the recently announced Snapdragon 835   premium processor being manufactured by Samsung using its   10-nanometer LPE (""low power early"") technology.A big open question, though, is this: Where will the successor   to the Snapdragon 835 be manufactured, and on what   technology?On one hand, if Qualcomm and Samsung keep up their   collaboration, we could see a next-generation Snapdragon built   using Samsung's performance-enhanced variant of its 10-nanometer   technology, known as 10-nanometer LPP (""low power plus"").This technology isn't expected to provide an area shrink, but   Samsung says that it will provide a performance boost over the   10-nanometer LPE technology. Qualcomm could leverage that   technology, coupled with architectural enhancements, to build a   compelling next-generation premium Snapdragon chip.At the same time, though, TSMC's upcoming 7-nanometer offering   -- which is expected to go into risk production soon (if it   hasn't gone into it already) -- should go into production in the   first half of 2018. This 7-nanometer technology promises a   performance bump from TSMC's 10-nanometer technology (and   potentially Samsung's, assuming TSMC's and Samsung's 10-nanometer   technologies offer comparable performance) as well as an area   reduction.If Qualcomm breaks for TSMC for the 7-nanometer technology   generation, then that could mean a nice revenue boost for the   latter as Qualcomm's premium smartphone chip volumes are quite   significant. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see Qualcomm   stick with Samsung's manufacturing technology given that Samsung   is a significant buyer of Qualcomm's premium chips.In the case that Qualcomm does opt to stay with Samsung in   coming premium smartphone chip generations, TSMC might view   MediaTek as an important strategic partner with whom it can   regain premium Android smartphone chip share.After all, if Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon chips are all   manufactured by Samsung, and since Qualcomm dominates the premium   smartphone chip market, TSMC's only ways to regain share in that   segment are the following:Collaborations with smartphone vendors that design their     own chips for premium flagship devices that compete with     Qualcomm powered flagships (i.e. iPhone) and,Share gains on the part of merchant chip competitors that     work with TSMC to manufacture their chips.TSMC has done a good job with the first (it builds chips for   the iPhone, Huawei's premium smartphones, and even Xiaomi's first   in-house chip), but it has limited control over the second.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Winners From the Nintendo Switch Teardown;3/8/2017;"Struggling gaming giantNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) recently released its next-gen gaming   platform, known as the Nintendo Switch. The device has seen   lukewarm reviews in the tech press, with IGN saying that the   Switch is a ""jack of many trades, but a master of none"" and PC   Advisor praising its design and versatility but criticizing its   ""Joy-Con performance problems, limited software, and expensive   accessories.""At this point, it's probably too early to tell how the device   will do in the marketplace (though, frankly, my hopes aren't   high). However, should the product ultimately perform well, here   are three suppliers -- revealed in iFixit's recent teardown of a   Nintendo Switch -- that could potentially benefit.Image source: Nintendo.makeArticleAd();The brains of the Nintendo Switch come from...The biggest potential winner from the Switch is graphics   specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) . NVIDIA has done extremely well for itself in the   lucrative market for stand-alone graphics processors targeted at   gaming personal computers, but it has been largely absent from   the game console market for quite some time.Inside of the Nintendo Switch is an applications processor   developed by NVIDIA. Not too much is known about the chip itself   (though it is said to be a derivative of the company's Tegra X1   processor), but for every Nintendo Switch that gets sold, NVIDIA   will generate some revenue and, presumably, a reasonable amount   of gross profit.Though a more extensive teardown will be required to verify   the following,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companymay also be a winner here as it is likely the contract chip   manufacturer for the NVIDIA chip design (since the Tegra X1 is   manufactured by TSMC). A teardown of the chip itself by the likes   of Chipworks will be required to confirm this, though.Memory sourced from South KoreaThe iFixit teardown shows that the Nintendo Switch includes   DRAM -- that is, the main system memory -- built by South Korean   memory giantSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Now, the Switch apparently comes with two 2-gigabyte memory   chips for a total of 4 gigabytes of modern LPDDR4 memory. LPDDR4   is the memory type currently in use in premium smartphones, and   high-end smartphones these days have between 2 and 6 gigabytes,   so the memory content inside of the Nintendo Switch is   essentially equivalent to that of a reasonably high-end   smartphone.This is by no means a game-changing win for Samsung, which   generated 34.29 trillion Korean won (equivalent to about $30   billion in U.S. dollars) in memory revenue (this includes both   DRAM and NAND flash), but every bit helps.Would the real Wi-Fi supplier stand up?The iFixit teardown shows that the Wi-Fi chip is a chip known   as the BCM4356. The chip's part number indicates that it's aBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) chip design, but iFixit lists it as a Broadcom/Cypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) part.As it turns out, the BCM4356 was part of Broadcom's Internet   of Things (IoT) lineup. Broadcom sold its IoT business to Cypress   Semiconductor in the middle of last year, so it's not Broadcom   that gets the win here -- it's Cypress Semiconductor.By way of reference, though the chip was called the BCM4356 by   Broadcom, it has been rebranded as the CYW4356 by Cypress.When the transaction to sell Broadcom's IoT business to   Cypress was announced, the companies said that this business unit   ""generated $189 million in revenue during the last twelve   months.""If Cypress is selling these chips to Nintendo for perhaps   $5-$10 a piece, then significant Nintendo Switch unit shipments   could translate into real revenue growth for this business.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Broadcom Ltd. Expects Samsung to Try to Claw Back Premium Smartphone Share;3/8/2017;"Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is an interesting chip company to follow,   particularly for investors looking to get reads on howApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) are doing in the high-end smartphone   market.Indeed, Broadcom is a key supplier of Wi-Fi and RF chips to   both companies, as well as to other high-end smartphone vendors.   As Broadcom's wireless chip business depends heavily on those two   companies' sales, its financial commentary often includes ""clues""   that indicate that the near-term future might hold for Apple,   Samsung, and others.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();One key takeaway from Broadcom's most recent earnings results   is that Samsung is looking to make a serious effort to take   high-end smartphone market share, potentially at Apple's   expense.Apple revenue down, Samsung revenue upApple and Samsung don't launch flagship smartphones at the   same time -- Apple's products come in the fall, while Samsung's   flagship Galaxy S devices tend to arrive in the spring. The word   is that Samsung will announce the Galaxy S8-series smartphones in   late March of 2017 with availability happening in late April.According to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, Broadcom's wireless   revenue dropped 13% sequentially in the company's most recent   quarter ""driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a   major North American customer.""In other words, demand for wireless chips that go into the   iPhone was down as Apple moves past the peak of the iPhone 7   product cycle.For the second quarter of 2017, Broadcom says it expects to   ""hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major   North American customer"" -- in other words, sales of components   to Apple in support of the iPhone 7 cycle will trough in the   current quarter, with sales likely rebounding as Apple begins to   build up inventory of its next-generation iPhones.However -- and this is where it gets good -- Tan says that the   company expects that a ""significant portion"" of the decline that   it expects to see from Apple to be offset by the ramp up of sales   to its ""large Korean smartphone customer."" In other words,   Samsung.To be clear, Tan says that the company still expects wireless   revenue to be down quarter over quarter (so the Samsung ramp-up   won't completely offset the iPhone ramp down), but he expects an   increase in Broadcom chip content inside of the new Samsung   phones to help drive a high-single-digit decline that's ""better   than the typical double-digit declines [Broadcom has] experienced   in prior years.""Potentially more than just contentBroadcom's financial commentary and expectations vis-a-vis the   Samsung S8 ramp appear to be driven more by the content increase   rather than potential market share gain. However, Tan did   indicate that Samsung is trying quite hard to recapture   share.Indeed, he said that Broadcom's ""Korean customer"" is ""coming   in with a vengeance to try to recover share.""Only time will tell how much share Samsung can recapture with   its Galaxy S8 line of smartphones (and if that share gain comes   at Apple's expense or that of other Android phone vendors), but   initial leaks show that the device at leastlooksnice, with a very high screen-to-body ratio as well as   top-notch specifications.However, it won't be too long before Samsung formally launches   the devices and the company gives some indication of the initial   sales velocity of the new phones.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 New Technologies That Could Power Cirrus Logic Higher;3/8/2017;"Image Source: Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) paid the price ofdependingonApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for 85% of its revenue in the third quarter.   Though it delivered a tremendous financial performance due to the   ramp up in iPhone 7 production, a tepid outlook sent alarm bells   ringing. The stock market took note of Cirrus Logic's weak   outlook and its sharesdropped 14% the next day.makeArticleAd();The problem is that Cirrus' revenue is highly dependent on the   iPhone production cycle, which is like putting all your eggs in   one basket. If Apple does not increase Cirrus' content in its   phones or cuts its production volumes, the latter's financial   performance gets severely impacted. Apple is not expected to   bring any new Cirrus technology into its next iPhone.No increase in chip content at Apple is going to hurt Cirrus'   revenue growth. Consensus estimates indicate that its revenue   will grow only 6.5% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to estimated   gains of 31% in the current fiscal year.Cirrus needs the power of diversification in order to sustain   its strong revenue growth and avoid Apple-related fluctuations.   The good news for Cirrus investors is that there are two key   technologies that could help it diversify not just in smartphones   but into other industries as well.Voice biometrics will be a big dealCirrus' research in voice biometrics will play a major role in   its push to diversify itself as this technology, which allows   people to interact with their devices via voice, will find   application in a variety of fields. Voice biometrics has several   use cases, ranging from connected cars to smart homes to the   Internet of Things. The technology is also gaining traction in   the fields of banking and financial services for user   authentication.Infiniti Research forecasts that the voice recognition   biometrics market will grow at an annual pace of almost 19.4%   from 2017 to 2021. This is close to the 22.9% annual growth   expected by Tractica in the overall biometrics market, which   includes other sub-segments such as facial, fingerprint, and iris   recognition.In all, the total biometrics market is expected to be worth   $15.1 billion by 2025, according to Tractica, and voice   recognition stands to be an important pillar of its growth due to   its application across industries. Banks, for instance, are   increasingly deploying voice biometrics. BothBarclaysandHSBCstarted using voice recognition to securely identify customers   last year.What's more, the adoption of voice biometrics in mobile   devices is also expected to pick up pace going forward. Apple   itself filed a patent last February related to   voice-recognition-based authentication. Apple's patent filing   says that:A device can be configured to receive speech input from a     user. The speech input can include a command for accessing a     restricted feature of the device. The speech input can be     compared to a voiceprint (e.g., text-independent voiceprint) of     the user's voice to authenticate the user to the device.Cirrus can capitalize on the possibility of Apple deploying   voice biometrics in its future phones as it is all set to ""tape   out"" its first component in 2017. Cirrus management says that the   company will start sampling its voice-biometrics-enabling   components in the quarter that runs July September of 2017.Cirrus believes that it could start generating revenue from   this technology after the next fiscal year ends. Therefore, it   won't be surprising if Cirrus' growth gets back on track after a   weak fiscal 2018 once it launches its voice biometrics-enabling   chips.Active noise cancellation is a more immediate     catalystTechSci Research forecasts that the market for earphones and   headphones could surpass $19 billion in revenue over the next   five years as smartphone makers try to deliver a superior audio   experience to customers. The use of active noise cancellation   (ANC) technology is one way to deliver an immersive audio   experience.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , for instance, is expected to sell   ANC-enabled wireless headphones alongside the upcoming Galaxy S8.   Samsung believes that the use of ANC will allow it to cut out   ambient noise by a maximum of 20 decibels and result in a better   audio experience, which will give it a differentiating factor   against rivals.An immersive audio experience, however, will not come cheap as   Samsung is expected to charge 130 euros (or $138 approximately)   for the headphones. Now, Cirrus' first headset with ANC   technology is expected to be launched soon. As Samsung is one of   its customers, it is likely that a Cirrus chip is powering the   Korean giant's ANC-enabled headphone.What's more, Cirrus is already in talks with more customers   for its ANC headsets and seems to have landed a few design wins   already. As the design wins materialize and the adoption of voice   biometrics and ANC gains traction, Cirrus Logic will find new   avenues to augment its growth.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone continues to be the subject of intense speculation. With the countdown on to finalizing design and starting production of the new iPhone, two details in particular have seen conflicting theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggests AAPL will go with the iPhone Edition - instead of iPhone 8 or 10th anniversary iPhone - for its flagship model.The website also feels it has nailed the display size, and agrees with a previous report that the new iPhone could arrive significantly later than usual.iPhone 8 = iPhone Edition?What to call the new iPhone is actually a big deal this year. The regular naming sequence will continue with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those are the phones for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expected to release -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebrates a decade in the business (and hopefully helps to propel sales to stratospheric levels)?The iPhone X, 10th Anniversary iPhone and iPhone 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversary iPhonenextyear? And iPhone 8 would mess up Apple's naming scheme for its mainstream models.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhone Edition. The premium Apple Watch model is the Apple Watch Edition, so the precedent has already been set and it would be consistent. This would also solve the continuity problem associated with naming a new iPhone specifically around the 10th anniversary, without messing up the current iPhone naming scheme. iPhone Edition makes sense.About the New iPhone DisplayOutside of whether it would be curved or not, or OLED or not, there have been conflicting reports about the display's size. Most analysts have been calling for a 5.8-inch display with bezels practically eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhone that's smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.It's a similar approach to whatSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appears to have taken with the Galaxy S8.However,Mac Otakarahas always maintained - and still insists - that the new iPhone will have a 5-inch display. Which seems weird, given the consumer preference for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnected the dotsand theorizes that the information given to the Japanese website is for theusablespace. The remaining display area would be where AAPL has a row of virtual buttons - a feature that has already been mentioned as replacing the Home button and mimicking the functionality of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Take a 5.8-inch display, reserve the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effectively a 5-inch display in terms of what the owner can make use of.The math is starting to add up.iPhone Edition Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagrees with the growing number of analysts who are predicting the iPhone 8 - or iPhone Edition - is going to face a delayed release.A few days ago,9to5 Macreported the iPhone 7s series would go into production in July, as expected. But there are rumors that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integrating into the new iPhone Edition's display is proving challenging. The added manufacturing complexity may push mass production for the new flagship model to September. That would mean severe supply constraints, including the possibility that theiPhone Edition would not begin shipping until a month after the iPhone 7s, with only early pre-orders being delivered in 2017.If the production issues turn out to be true, the results could be problematic … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Apple would face the possibility that potential iPhone 7s buyers hold off until they can physically compare it against the iPhone Edition, delaying that wave of upgrades. Potential iPhone Edition buyers could also shrug and order the iPhone 7s instead, not wishing to wait a few months for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhone Edition together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularly record-smashing launch sales weekend it is gunning for to celebrate that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sales that accompany every new iPhone release could be extended. The iPhone 7s would get the first rush, followed by the iPhone Edition.It's possible.As always, stay tuned. At this stage, everything we ""know"" about the new iPhone is speculation. But with AAPL's supply chain starting to crank up for production, the pieces are beginning to fall into place.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?;3/6/2017;"Mobile chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chinese smartphone giantXiaomiare often considered close partners. Qualcomm became one of   Xiaomi's earliest investors in 2011, and all of Xiaomi's flagship   devices use Qualcomm chips. When regulatory troubles in China   forced Qualcomm to renegotiate its licensing terms with OEMs,   Xiaomi was one of the first companies tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that alliance gradually weakened. Xiaomi eventually   started using moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chips in its cheaper devices, and    ongoing rumors indicated that the company was developing   first-party chips. Those rumors were finally confirmed in late   February, when Xiaomi unveiled the Surge S1 chip for its new   mid-range Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi's Mi5c. Image source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();The Surge S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which   run at 2.2GHz with another four running at 1.4GHz. Its Mali T-860   MP4 GPU is capable of playing 4K videos. Those specs make it   slightly more  powerful than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625, a   popular octa-core processor which powers mid-range devices like   the international variant of Xiaomi's Mi Note 4. The S1 was   produced by Xiaomi's subsidiary Pinecone Electronics via a   partnership with Chinese chipmakerLeadcore.Why Xiaomi needed to make its own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi became the biggest smartphone maker in   China. But by the end of 2016, it had dropped to fifth place   afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That decline was caused by   competitors flooding the market with comparably priced phones, a   shift in consumer tastes toward pricier devices, and an overall   slowdown across the Chinese smartphone market.Last November, Xiaomi admitted that its  core phone   business wasn't profitable. In January, it stopped disclosing   annual shipment  figures and abruptly announced that it   would skip this year's Mobile World Congress. Those moves all   indicated that the company was struggling to stay afloat in the   crowded Chinese market.However, Xiaomi also noticed that it could follow Apple,   Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-party ARM chips.   Producing first-party chips is a pricey investment, but it's a   smart long-term play because it reduces Xiaomi's dependence on   chipmakers like Qualcomm, cuts production costs, tightens up the   supply chain, and gives it full control over the hardware and the   software -- which could better optimize its devices for Xiaomi's   MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi's Mi Air Purifier. Image source: Xiaomi.In addition to lowering costs and boosting performance, IDC   analyst Bryan Ma also noted that Xiaomi's first-party chips could   work better with its smart home ecosystem, which already includes   air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers.   Xiaomi could also use its first-party chips to bypass a ban on   MediaTek chips in India, which occurred due to a patent dispute   withEricsson.What this means for QualcommXiaomi's introduction of first-party chips isn't good news for   Qualcomm, but there's no indication that Xiaomi will stop using   Qualcomm chips altogether. The Mi 5c merely represents the budget   device of its flagship Mi 5 family -- which includes the original   Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5   devices use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surge S1 could actually hurt MediaTek -- which   supplies Xiaomi with chips for variants of its low and mid-range   devices -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surge S1 becomes Xiaomi's   official mid-range chipset, it could stop using MediaTek chips as   Qualcomm chips remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm's Snapdragon could lose its spot in mid-range devices   like the Mi Note 4, but the overall impact on its chipmaking   business might be minimal. Xiaomi's global market share is   already likely below 5%, based on IDC estimates, and could   continue fading as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices.   SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devices use Qualcomm chips, higher sales   at those leading brands could easily offset any design losses at   Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investors be worried?If Xiaomi had revealed the Surge S1 back in 2014, then swapped   out all Qualcomm chips with its own silicon, I think investors   would have been worried. But Xiaomi is merely aiming its new   chips at the mid-range market today, and any losses from Xiaomi   could probably be offset by higher sales of other rival Android   devices.Therefore, investors shouldn't consider Xiaomi's announcement   to be a major blow to Qualcomm on its own. Nonetheless, the   overall trend is worrisome, because it indicates that Qualcomm's   chipmaking business -- which posted flat year-over-year sales   growth last quarter -- will likely continue ceding market share   to first-party ARM chips for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe collapse ofBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) has been stunning. But in the tech world, such things do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRY stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it's amazing that the company has been able to recover from having to deal with the onslaught of mega operators likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let's face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up successful fight. This was certainly a major reason why CEO Steve Ballmer stepped aside.But survival is not enough, of course. So it should be no surprise that - for the past five years - BBRY stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, this was the sentiment for say,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gauge the potential opportunity of BlackBerry stock, let's take a look at three pros and cons:3 Pros On BBRY StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which was struggling againstOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructured the operations and redirected the company towards enterprise mobility and commerce. He would ultimately sell Sybase toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefty $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also has strongtechnical chops. Consider that he has a master's in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology. He also got his first job as an engineer withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transitioning a company from hardware to software is no easy feat. But Chen has definitely made lots of progress with this strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenues from Software & Services came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% was recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterprise customer orders in the quarter.For Chen, he has made some savvy acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And another important part of the strategy has been to outsource phone development. This has meant fewer distractions as well as the opportunity to pick-up high-margin licensing revenues.Something else: Chen has done a good job in leveraging some of the long-time core technology assets. An example of this is BlackBerry Secure, which is a full-blown suite of mobile enterprise apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRY is trying to position itself to get a share of the embedded technology market, which is seeing tremendous growth from the auto sector. Note that the company has BlackBerry QNX, which is a software development platform that provides top-notch security features and has been awarded the ISO 26262 ASIL D certification for cars. The system is optimized to support leading vendors likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.As a testament to the advantages of QNX, BBRY recently signed an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Cons On BBRY StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRY was the global leader in the fast-growing smartphone market. But the iPhone would quickly end this dominance. What's more, BBRY made plenty of blunders, such as in terms of awful launches.The result is that the BlackBerry brand is fairly tarnished. Granted, this many not seem to matter as much since the company has moved away from the consumer market. However, the brand could still be a problem with business customers as well. Why use technology from a company that seems to have a dicey future?Competition: It's intense. When it comes to the security market, there are many players that have great offerings likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterprise mobility solutions also has many tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY's offerings in the messaging category also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT's Skype, AAPL's iMessage and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRY seems to be good buyout bait. The company's cost structure has been streamlined, there are strong technology assets and a large customer base.Yet According toInvestorPlace.com's Richard Saintvilus: ""It has become clear that Chen - who was brought in to build BlackBerry into an M&A target - has taken this company as far as he can take it. Despite all of the boasting the company has done about its superior security capabilities, BBRY stock has had no M&A suitors, suggesting companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracle Corporation and other enterprise-focused companies with which BlackBerry has often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRY StockAgain, Chen has done a great job. Let's face it, BBRY was a complete mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsHe wasted little time with cost cutting and outsourcing of the phone business. More importantly, he has invested in areas like security, embedded systems and even the Internet of Things (IoT).However, despite all this, the fact remains that progress has been grudging. If anything, it will probably still take some time - say a year or so - for the changes to have a real impact. In other words, for those looking at BBRY stock, it's probably best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Samsung Facing 10-Nano Yield Issues;3/3/2017;"Contract chip manufacturersTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) both recently began mass production of chips   using their respective 10-nanometer chip manufacturing   technologies.Both companies' 10-nanometer technologies allow chipmakers to   build more densely packed (meaning more features) and   higher-performing products, two things that are generally good in   the world of chips.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();However, according to a recentreportfrom DigiTimes, both TSMC and Samsung are facing manufacturing   yield issues with their respective 10-nanometer technologies.   Let's go over the implications of those yield challenges.Why are low manufacturing yields bad?Manufacturing yield refers to the percentage of manufactured   chips that both work and meet the performance and power   specifications mandated by the design. It generally costs a fixed   amount of money to manufacture a wafer of chips, so the higher   the yield rate, the greater the number of chips are produced for   a given cost, which means lower effective per-chip cost.Conversely, low yield rates mean higher costs. Such costs can   either be passed on to the customer, the chip manufacturing   company itself could eat the costs, or the responsibility could   be shared.Additionally, chipmakers put in a certain amount of   manufacturing capacity in anticipation of customer demand. If   manufacturing yield rates are too far below plan, then a customer   using the low-yielding technology may not be able to get ahold of   sufficient supply of products.So, low manufacturing yields are generally bad for   business.Specific impacts on TSMC's and Samsung's     customersThe lead customer for TSMC's 10-nanometer technology appears   to be MediaTek, which is using this technology to manufacture its   Helio X30 line of premium smartphone chips. In a statement to   Nikkei Asian Review, a MediaTek executivesaidthat the X30 was ""delayed because the yield rate of 10   [nanometer] process technology [from TSMC] has not yet reached a   satisfactory level... and we are a bit stuck on that.""A silver lining here is that MediaTek doesn't expect   significant adoption of the X30 in premium smartphones (saying   that it expects the X30 to be used in ""less than 10 smartphone   models""), so these yield challenges are unlikely to significantly   disrupt MediaTek's business or the businesses of its   customers.For Samsung and its lead customer, mobile chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the struggle is more significant. The Samsung   Galaxy S8-series devices that are set to be formally announced   later this month are expected to Samsung's Exynos 8895 for some   variants and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in other   variants. Both chips are believed to be manufactured by   Samsung using its 10-nanometer LPE technology. DigiTimes   says that Samsung delayed the rollout of the Galaxy S8-series   devices due ""unsatisfactory yield rates.""How about the iPhone?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to tap TSMC to manufacture the   former's upcoming A11 applications processor on the latter's   10-nanometer technology. The bad news is that the yield   challenges described by DigiTimes could impact Apple's ability to   meet demand for its next-generation iPhones.The good news is that Apple's next iPhone models aren't   expected to launch until the fall, which gives both Apple and   TSMC additional time to work out the kinks on the 10-nanometer   technology.Furthermore, some of the yield issues that MediaTek may be   seeing could be related to its underlying chip design rather than   only due to TSMC's technology. In that case, there's a reasonable   chance that Apple won't face quite the yield problems that   MediaTek is apparently coping with.10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor     ManufacturingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama Continues;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere has been a flurry of excitement this week overApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8. The fuss started a few days ago whenThe Wall Street Journalpublished an update on the new iPhone and stated that the Lightning port would be dropped in favor of USB-C. Given the fuss over AAPL ditching the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, the spectre of the company abandoning another legacy port evoked strong reaction.makeArticleAd();Source: Brad MoonNow, a new report from a well-known Apple analyst claims all 2017 iPhones - including the 10th-anniversary iPhone 8 - will stick with Lightning ports, butwilladopt USB-C's fast-charging technology.Here's the latest on the Lightning port controversy.New Theory: AAPL Keeps the Lightning PortMacRumorspublished KGI Securities analystMing-Chi Kuo's take on the controversy. He is certain all 2017 iPhones, including the iPhone 8, will keep their Lightning port. However, he predicts that AAPL is investigating the adoption of the USB-C Power Delivery standard in that Lightning port. Doing so would retain compatibility with Lightning accessories, but with the advantage of much faster wired charging for the new iPhones.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchKuo also notes several reasons why AAPL would not choose to implement USB-C instead of staying with its proprietary Lightning port, beyond the potential consumer backlash. The company would be giving up revenue from its MFi program that certifies Lightning accessories. And USB-C ports are physically larger than Lightning - given AAPL's obsession with making iPhones thinner, switching to a larger port seems unlikely.Why Has USB-C Been Such a Flashpoint Issue?The meresuggestionthat AAPL would ditch the Lightning port in favor of USB-C has generated a huge number of articles and editorials and filled Apple forums. Why the fanfare over a simple charging port?There are actually two issues at play here.The first is a sensitivity to Apple eliminating legacy ports. After the company got rid of the decades-old standard 3.5mm jack on the iPhone 7, there were accusations AAPL had done so arbitrarily - maybe to sell more Beats wireless headphones. Even rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) hopped on the bandwagon,mocking AAPL's decisionwhen it launched the Galaxy Note 7 - complete with headphone jack.After the Galaxy Note 7's exploding batteries, Samsung may avoid such public taunting in the future. Karma….In the fall, Apple released a new MacBook Pro that had all legacy connectivity ports replaced with USB-C. This infuriated many long-time Mac users because it meant having to buy adapters and dongles for all their current accessories and peripherals. A switch from Lightning to USB-C would be seen by many as another Apple move done more or less arbitrarily, without consideration for the impact it may have on customers.On the other side of the equation, there are also many Apple fans who would love to see the company ditch the proprietary Lightning port for USB-C, which is becoming an industry standard.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsCount MacBook Pro (and MacBook) owners in that group - they have to purchase a Lightning to USB-C cable if they want to connect an iPhone to their laptop. These people were excited to see theWall Street Journal'spredictionthat AAPL would make the big move.So Where Are We Now on the iPhone 8 Lightning Port?As usual, no one knows for certain what AAPL's plans are. I tend to side with the analysts who are suggesting that Apple isn't about to court controversy with such a critical iPhone release, and will keep the Lightning port but maybe pack in a USB-C cable or adapter this time around.The one thing youcanbet on is that AAPL is watching the conversation and evaluating reaction - if not for the iPhone 8, then for a little further down the line.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 20177 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postApple Inc.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Hopes Old Phone Revival Can Help NOK Stock;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe high-tech world is still buzzing afterNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) andBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) showed off new handsets at last weekend's Mobile World Conference. However, I'm not sure nostalgia for candy bar phones and keyboard PDAs draws the right kind of attention to either company.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)For one, NOK never really left the ""dumb"" end of the phone market behind, so the company's grand ""return"" with a new version of its near-indestructible 3310 handset - popular in 2001 at a price around $120 - is only a shock to people who stopped paying attention, which they did for a reason.Granted, the feature phones that NOK recently pulled back out ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) orbit accounted for 9% of the category last year, but that No. 2 share behindSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only added up to 35 million handsets, or at best 2% of the global phone market.A Lesson in Scale for NOK StockSure, it's remotely possible that the return of the 3310 at $50 will somehow dramatically reverse 16 years of technology progress, and be enough to convince a new generation of back-to-basics consumers to trade in their smartphones, I find it unlikely.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017I just don't see that happening here in numbers that even double NOK's market share, and even if it does, an extra 35 million $50 handsets sold close to cost really isn't going to move the needle for NOK stock. Even if the company manages to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it's going to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That's the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it's still a big company, built on the chassis of the old Alcatel and Lucent networking businesses. Now that it has its phones back from MSFT, management needs to deploy them to embrace the future and expand on the role the company wants to play in the Internet of Things (IoT).To me, that means developing phones that don't compete withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consumer pocket space, but ones that instead let smart devices communicate with each other. Consider that, in a world of billions of $50 machine-to-machine data relays, the market becomes very interesting for NOK stock investors.It's a similar story for BBRY, which was evolving nicely into an IoT proposition, until now. We may feel nostalgic for the days of a ubiquitous business BlackBerry, but that era was over more than a decade ago. We've since learned to type on virtual keyboards.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe question I have about the next generation of BBRY devices revolves around what great things they can do to win consumers away from the iPhones and Androids that already dominate the market. They need to trigger a revolution and not just recapitulate the past.The bottom line is, as interesting as it was to get a blast from the past from these two companies, I just don't see this strategy being a boon for either stock right now.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Is It Finally Time to Buy HP Inc. Stock?;3/2/2017;"Shares ofHP(NYSE: HPQ)  jumped 9% on Feb. 23, after the PC and printer   vendor posted a solid first quarter report. Revenue rose 4%   annually to  $12.7 billion, beating expectations by $850   million. Non-GAAP earnings grew 6% to $0.38 per share, topping   estimates by a penny.That marked HP's second straight quarter of year-over-year   revenue growth, and represented its best top line growth since it   split fromHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) in late 2015. Does that rebound indicate that it's   finally safe to buy HP again? Let's take a closer look at the   bull and bear cases to decide.HP's Envy curved all-in-one PC. Image source: HP.makeArticleAd();The bull case for HPWhen HP and HPE first split, it seemed like the former would   be burdened by fading legacy businesses as the latter expanded   into higher growth enterprise markets. PC shipments have declined   for five straight years, according toGartner, and printer sales growth remains anemic due to the longevity of   existing hardware and the growing use of digital documents.That's why HP's growth in the first quarter was so surprising.   Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 10% annually to $8.2 billion,   fueled by 7% growth from commercial customers and 15% growth from   mainstream consumers. Desktop sales stayed flat, but notebook   sales surged 16%. In comparison, HP's rivalLenovo(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) posted just 2% sales growth in its PC and   tablets division last quarter. Gartner also notes that HP's   market share grew from 18.8% to 20.4% between the fourth quarters   of 2015 and 2016 -- and it remains the  second biggest PC   maker after Lenovo.During the  conference call, CFO Catherine Lesjak   attributed that growth to a better ""mix shift"" toward ""premium""   convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices with   longer-lasting batteries. This was an encouraging reversal from   the earlier notion that PCs had to become dirt cheap to counter   Chromebooks. Looking further ahead, higher demand for ""VR ready""   PCs could also get its desktop growth back on track.HP's high-end Spectre laptop. Image source: HP.Last quarter, HP generated over $700 million in free cash flow   and spent over $600 million on buybacks and dividends. Those   moves keep HP's multiple low at 12 times earnings with a forward   yield of 3% -- which is supported by a low payout ratio of 32%.   Analyst expectations for the current year  (1% sales growth   and flat earnings growth) are also low that so upside surprises   are more likely than downside ones.The bear case against HPHowever, HP's printer business remains weak. Total printing   revenues dropped 3% annually to $4.5 billion, as 2% growth in   consumer hardware failed to offset an 8% decline in commercial   hardware and 3% drop in supply sales. HP believes that scaling up   through its acquisition ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printing business could boost the unit's   sales and margins after the deal closes in the second half of   2017. However, that move will also boost the weight of the   sluggish printing business relative to Personal Systems -- which   could eventually hurt HP's overall top line growth.HP also believes that sales of large format 3D printers for   industrial customers will offset softer sales of traditional   printers, but that market remains a small one compared to its   core inkjet and laser products. New subscription services for   supplies may boost its higher-margin revenues, but that strategy   faces  ongoing legal challenges from makers of generic   cartridges.It's also tough for HP to sell commoditized products like PCs   and printers overseas due to higher component costs and currency   headwinds. During the conference call, Lesjak warned that HP had   "" increased pricing globally in response to unfavorable currency   movements and the increased cost of components, which could have   a more significant impact on demand than we've assumed."" This   indicates that the Personal Systems unit's operating margin of   3.8% could drift lower this year.Lastly, much of HP's earnings growth comes from layoffs and   buybacks instead of gross margin expansion. Last October, HP   announced that it slash up to 4,000 jobs (about 8% of its   workforce) over the following three years to generate up  to   $300 million in annual savings by the beginning of fiscal 2020.   Streamlining the business can be a wise move, but downsizing in   the face of tough competition could also dull its competitive   edge.The verdict: HP is a safe buySplitting with HPE initially seemed like a risky move, but HP   has done a solid job evolving its aging PC business while scaling   up and diversifying its printing one. HP isn't a sexy high-growth   stock, but it's fundamentally cheap, has a respectable dividend,   and is a market leader in the recovering PC market. I believe   that those qualities make it a safe core holding for conservative   income investors.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What Is Apple Inc. Doing With Its iPhone 8 Lightning Port?;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier today, a report suggested thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is consideringeliminating the Lightning port on the iPhone 8, replacing it with USB-C. Now an analyst with Barclays is floating the possibility that the move is tied to a European Commission campaign pushing for smartphones to adopt a universal charger.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleHe suggests the Lightning port will remain, with Apple offering a Lightning to USB-C adapter for iPhones sold on that continent.The Wall Street Journal's iPhone 8 ReportThis controversy began early on Tuesday morning, whenThe Wall Street Journalpublished an articleupdating its take on where Apple is going with the new iPhone. The primary focus of the piece was on the expected curved AOMLED display -similar to the oneSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) offers with the Galaxy S7 Edge.But there was also a more controversial claim. Citing sources said to be familiar with AAPL's iPhone 8 release plans, there was this:""They said Apple would introduce other updates including a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company's original Lightning connector.""If true, the implications of such a move are considerable.Uh Oh: Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Ditch Lightning Port on iPhone 8?Apple is looking to its 10th anniversary iPhone to be a smash hit. The controversy surrounding the elimination of the port - which has been used on all Apple iOS devices since 2012 - could negatively impact that launch.Last year's 's iPhone 7 launch was clouded by complaints when the company chose to eliminate the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. In 2012, when AAPL ditched the 30-pin connector it had used for nearly a decade, the move meant buyers of the iPhone 5 couldn't use their new iPhone with existing speaker docks, cables and other accessories.Moving from Lightning to USB-C wouldn't beasdisruptive since many accessories now use wireless connectivity, but the move would still undoubtedly generate some bad PR.One Mobile Phone Charge for AllAs I pointed out this morning, one benefit for Apple would besynergy among its products. Currently, MacBooks and the new MacBook Pro have only USB-C ports, so iPhone 7 buyers can't physically connect to them without buying a cable. Switching to USB-C on the iPhone 8 would eliminate that problem.However, Barclays managing director Blayne Curtis has a theory that AAPL may not actually ditch the Lightning port.He toldMacRumorshe believes the USB-C issue istied to a European campaign to eliminate proprietary smartphone chargers.The European Commission's ""One Mobile Phone Charge For All"" campaign has a goal of having all manufacturers adopt a single charger standard. With more than 30 different phone chargers in use, it was estimated they generated over 51,000 tons of electronic waste per year in the EU. Since USB-C is the new standard that many smartphones, tablets and computers are moving toward, it would make sense to adopt USB-C as the single smartphone charger standard.According to Curtis, Apple is reacting to that EU goal, but to achieve the objective, it would offer a Lighting-to-USB-C adapter instead of eliminating the Lightning port altogether.Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Whale of a Trade? Go Long Buffett!Doing so would mean one more dongle for European iPhone 8 owners, but wouldn't disrupt everyone else.Will iPhone 8 Be USB-C or Not?TheWall Street Journalhas an impressive record of predicting Apple's moves with new iPhones. And USB-C would make Apple's life simpler when it comes to connectivity with its latest laptops.But the Barclays theory makes sense. A Lightning-to-USB-C adapter isn't the most elegant solution, but it would achieve the European Commission's goal, without causing unwanted drama that could impact the critical 10th anniversary iPhone launch.Apple may yet ditch its proprietary Lightning port in favor of USB-C, but the iPhone 8 probably isn't the right time to do so.Of course, we won't find out for certain until September, so stay tuned.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMobile World Congress: Apple Inc.

Why Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Is Heading to $30;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) have havelost some steamover the past couple of weeks, falling more than 6% since MU stock reached a 52-week high of $25.31 on Feb. 2. Even with this modest correction, Micron stock has given its shareholders plenty to be excited about. As for investors who have waited on the sidelines, now's your chance.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Deal via FlickrMicron stock, which currently trades hands around $23.65, has a clear shot to reach $30 per share in the next 12 to 18 months.Although the company has faced some headwinds in the memory chip business, particularly due to a supply glut in the DRAM and NAND chips market, Micron has made the best out of a bad situation. In the most recent quarter, Micron posted adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share, which not only beat Street estimates by 4 cents, it reversed a loss of 5 cents in the previous quarter.Likewise, revenue came in at $3.97 billion, surging 19% year over year and 23% sequentially. These results, which suggests Micron has begun to take share from its competitors likeSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),Toshiba Corp NPV(OTCMKTS:TOSBF) andWestern Digital Corp(NASDAQ:WDC).7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks OffAs such, Micron has now forced analysts to become more bullish about its growth prospects and that of MU stock, despite the headwinds in the industry. And the company's guidance affirmed this.For the second quarter, MU forecasts earnings between 58 cents and 68 cents on revenue ranging between $4.35 billion and $4.7 billion, topping analysts' estimates of 39 cents per share on a revenue of $3.91 billion. And this level of confidence makes MU stock one of the better bargains in the space, particularly on the back of potentially higher DRAM prices.There's also the potential growth catalyst from itsInotera acquisitionto be excited about. The $4 billion deal for the Taiwan-based DRAM supplier, which closed in December, is expected to be immediately accretive not only to DRAM gross margins, but also earnings per share and free cash flow.Sure, there will be some execution risk tied to integrating Inotera. But given the string of earnings beats and the Micron's upbeat guidance, the management has basically assured the rewards far outweigh those risks.Bottom Line on Micron StockWith Micron stock still priced attractively at a forward price-earnings of 8, which is about ten points below theS&P 500, you would be hard-pressed to find another stock offering the combination of growth and value.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock: The Turnaround Is Real!Assuming Micron can achieve higher gross margins, combined with favorable DRAM pricing, these shares can reach $30 in the next 12 months, delivering 30% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time Gains3 Stocks to Buy That Love This Strong DollarThe postWhy Micron Technology, Inc.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Preparing a Red iPhone 7?;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) faces a challenge over the next six months. There's an all-new iPhone 8 expected in the fall. And rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is expected to pull out all the stops with a comeback Galaxy S8 in coming weeks. With the threat of AAPL fans holding onto their cash for the new iPhone and the risk of Samsung getting all the attention, how does the company keep sales of the relatively pedestrian iPhone 7 humming?makeArticleAd();Source: ColorWareIt sounds like AAPL may fall back to one of its favorite strategies: release a new color. If Japanese Apple blogMac Otakarais correct, we could see a red iPhone 7 in March.Apple Could Face a Big Dip in iPhone SalesAAPL is accustomed to cyclical fluctuations in its iPhone sales. The numbers tend to slow in the lead-up to the fall, when the new iPhone model is due to be released. However, this year, a confluence of factors could make that slowdown much more pronounced.The biggest factor is the iPhone 8. With the current iPhone 7, AAPL is winding down its first three-year product development cycle. That means the iPhone it's trying to convince people to buy for the next six months looks virtually identical to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s.5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%That can already be a tough sell, but the iPhone 8 isn't only the start of a new cycle - meaning it will look different and offer somecompelling new features- it's the10th anniversary iPhone. Everyone is looking to Apple to make a splash. Why would you buy a plain Jane iPhone 7 now if the completely new (and possiblyradicallynew) iPhone 8 is just months away?Then there's the Galaxy S8. Samsung is Apple's traditional rival for selling premium, flagship smartphones. After having its reputation - and smartphone sales - torched by the Galaxy Note 7's exploding battery crisis, Samsung is looking to the Galaxy S8 to mark its comeback. That is going to make things tougher for Apple over the next six months when it comes to attracting fence sitters, upgraders and those buying their first smartphone.The Answer Is … A Red iPhone 7?Apple doesn't have many options here. It could cut iPhone 7 prices, but AAPLneverdoes that. It could push up the iPhone 8 release, butthat has many risks.Instead,Mac Otakarais suggesting Apple will go to one of the oldest strategies in its marketing bag:a new color. And not just any new color. The blog (which has a reputation for getting a lot of these prediction right) is suggesting AAPL will release a red iPhone 7 in March.Apple has a long history of introducing new colors as a low-risk, low-cost way of generating new interest in products that are getting long in the tooth. It perfected this strategy with the iPod line-up, that would get a rainbow of new colors every year. It has done so in a more subdued way with the iPad and MacBook, adding new variations like Rose Gold.It actually used the strategy once already with the iPhone 7, introducing a glossy, Jet Black option at launch.A red iPhone 7 would be the first time Apple has released such a bold color for its smartphones. I mocked one up using theskin generatorfromColorWare, a company that has been successful at marketing flashy new appearances for a wide range of consumer electronics. There's no doubt, a red iPhone 7 would be a looker.Apple could even release such a device under its(PRODUCT)REDbanner. This is a series of red Apple products that contribute toward a global fund to fight Aids. Most of these are accessories, but a red iPhone 7 would fit right in and offer the advantage of letting AAPL promote the smartphone as part of the (PRODUCT)RED initiative, making it seem less like a marketing ploy.Fossil Group Inc (FOSL) Stock Is Down, But Not OutAccording toMac Otakara, we should see the red iPhone 7 make an appearance in March, at an event where AAPL is expected to refresh its iPad Pro lineup. Will a bold and shiny new color be enough to keep iPhone sales humming in the lead-up to the iPhone 8?That's a good question and one that will have a material impact to Apple's bottom line this year. AAPL has few other options and it sounds like the company may be willing to roll the dice with a new red iPhone 7.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postIs Apple Inc.

Should I Buy Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) seemed like a sure bet. Hey, with its CDMA platform, the company was at the heart of the fast-growing mobile market. QCOM stock was essentially a cash machine.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet lately the company has been in a slump. Since the summer of 2014, QCOM stock has lost about a third of its value. Of course, the tech industry is chock-full of examples of darlings that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when this happens, the gains can certainly be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% during the past couple years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upside or should investors remain wary? Let's take a look at three pros and three cons and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobile Powerhouse:The roots of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engineers teamed up to capitalize on the mobile industry. At first they focused on technologies to provide location-based services and messaging for the trucking industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, called CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.The business model was to license the technology, which would mean getting aggressive with patents. While success was not immediate, QCOM was determined to make CDMA a critical part of the mobile industry. And of course, this wager ultimately paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM's marquee customers includeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteMegatrends:The mobile market is expected to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continued demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are currently about 4 billion 3G/4G connections using CMDA systems and this is expected to increase to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substantial benefits from the emergence of 5G technologies. These will allow for better performance for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and even remote medical procedures. While QCOM's R&D investments will be vital for capitalizing on these trends, the company has also ramped upped its deal-making. No doubt, the most notable example of this isthe proposed $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the company is one of the top players in the fast-growing market for self-driving cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM's revenues are not growing at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there was a4% increase. But then again, the company is fairly mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remains a highly profitable business, with fiscal 2016 net income coming to$6.7 billion. The company has also been shareholder friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attractive 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Because of the extensive patent portfolio, QCOM collects a hefty royalty from most sales of smartphones across the globe - even for those devices that do not even include any of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chinese governmentchallenged QCOM's practices, and the case was eventually settled.But there are other major cases that are in the early stages, such as in South Korea, Europe and the U.S. Oh, and Apple has also launchedseveral major lawsuits against QCOM. The company certainly has tremendous resources to wage a brutal fight. Now as with any legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultimately loses, then its core business model will be in jeopardy and this could certainly have horrendous consequences. Keep in mind that the company gets about80% of its pretax profits from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president's agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump considers a currency manipulator. He has also called for stiff tariffs and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is likely to be adverse to U.S.-based companies that derives substantial revenues from China. Let's face it, the government is cracking down, favoring domestic-based operators over foreign ones. All in all, this poses material risks for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescome from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rivals includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a variety of startups that are gunning for the mobile market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultimately be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel entered an agreement with Apple to supply chips. Before this, QCOM was thesole supplier.In other words, if the legal battles go against the company, Intel may be in a better position to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuation is definitely attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is only about 11.5X.3 Reasons Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Heading to ZeroBut this may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litigation is far from clear - and of course, legal disputes often move at a glacial pace. So in light of this, it's probably best to avoid QCOM stock for now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

If the company ends up releasing licensed content from media companies (or even its own original content), a Facebook video app for TV means it can appeal to consumers who want to watch it as actual TV programming. And that introduces additional revenue opportunities - without having to split the cash with content uploaders.When Can We Expect the Facebook Video App for TV?FB is being a little vague about when it will actually release the app. The announcement says it will ""roll out soon to app stores for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV, with more platforms to come.""

3 More Companies Betting on Virtual Personal Assistants;2/2/2017;"As I'vewritten previously, this year seems like it will be the tipping point for virtual   personal assistants becoming part of most people's daily lives.   Not only are each of the largest tech companies represented, but   there are a number of other surprising entrants. As the   natural-language processing of artificial intelligence becomes   more widespread, even more companies will find uses for the   technology. Here are a few additional entries into the fray.Virtual personal assistants are at a tipping point. Image   source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();Image source: Nokia.1. NokiaNokia(NYSE: NOK) is reported to have submitted a trademark application   to the European Union for the name Viki. The application calls   it, in part, ""software for the creation and monitoring of mobile   and web assistants working with digital knowledge and combining   all data sources into a single chat and voice-based interface,""   according to International Business Times. At this point, not   much else is known about the company's digital-assistant   aspirations.Nokia sold its devices and services business toMicrosoftin 2014 and was bound by a non-compete agreement until the end of   2016. The Nokia brand is now owned by HMD Global, a company   formed by previous Nokia employees. Last year, Nokia acquired   French company Withings, a producer of consumer electronics and   wearable tech, and is planning to release a line of smartphones   and tablets in 2017. This would allow Nokia to integrate Viki   across a full line of its products, similar to the strategy used   by other tech companies.2. SamsungImage source: Viv.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) filed for its own trademark in Korea recently   for the name Bixby. It reportedly plans to integrate its virtual   assistant into nearly all the native apps on upcoming device   releases, and make them part of a unified system that accepts   voice commands. Last year, Samsung acquired artificial   intelligence start-up Viv, whose founders were largely   responsible for the development ofApple's Siri.At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York last year,   Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus provideda demonstrationof its technology. Asking questions using conversational   language, he was able to send money to a friend, send flowers for   his mother's birthday, and book a hotel room, all in a matter of   seconds. Based on the complex language understanding in the   demonstration, this system is capable of much more than many we   have seen thus far.One of Viv's most intriguing features is the ability to   identify objects using an optical-character-recognition system   tied to the camera on the device. It will reportedly launch a   native search tool, and allow the user to locate and purchase   items in a process that would bypassAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google search. If a trend like   this were to catch on, it could have a largely negative impact on   Google's search business, as other competitors might follow suit.   If the capabilities of the Viv system perform to expectations, it   would allow Samsung to leapfrog some existing competition.3. BaiduImage source: Flickr userJed Record. Image has been croppedBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) represents a unique entry into the field. It had   previously introduced its Duer virtual personal assistant; now it   has given it a body. Called Little Fish, the device possesses   many functions similar toAmazonEcho or Google Home. It differs in that it includes a tablet-like   touchscreen and small camera. It can display more complicated   information or detailed lists in response to a request, while   also providing a venue for video chat. It can stream both music   and videos.Little Fish can be used to order groceries and food from a   restaurant, but can prevent children from making purchases by   using facial recognition. Children can still make some requests,   like ""show me an elephant,"" and the screen will display an image.   The robotic base allows it to turn and follow the voice of the   user. Another distinctive feature is the ability to call the   robot from a smartphone and pan the camera remotely. Baidu   provideda demonstration of its capabilitieson YouTube.These latest entries are further confirmation that we are at a   tipping point. Virtual assistants, while still in their infancy,   are rounding the homestretch to widespread adoption. Each example   brings a different vision to the field, and further evolution   will occur as time goes on. 2017 indeed looks like a year of the   virtual assistant.10 stocks we like better than NokiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Are Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Fitbit Inc (FIT) the Perfect Long/Short Play?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent statistics from the two wearable rivals suggest thatGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) is winning the war againstFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), making a hypothetical long/short play between the two stocks a very interesting proposition.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitHowever, thinking about buying Garmin and shorting Fitbit stock - and actually following through with it - are two entirely different beasts.I have never shorted a stock and likely never will; I'm just not built that way. Whenever I'm asked byInvestorPlace, or any of the other financial publications I write for, to do a ""sell"" piece on a stock or a group of stocks, I always have a tougher time coming up with recommendations.I like to write about stocks that I would consider owning; negative spin doesn't enter my psyche. I can do it, it's just harder.This brings me to GRMN stock and FIT stock, the crux of this story.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Can't Fall Much Lower Than ThisIn Q3 2016, Garmin shipped 1.3 million wearable devices, a 12.2% year-over-year increase. That compares to an 11.0% YOY increase for Fitbit. In Q2 2016, Garmin shipped 1.6 million wearable devices, a 106.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier, while Fitbit shipped 5.7 million wearable devices, a 28.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier.So, in the nine months ended September 2016, Garmin shipped 3.8 million wearable devices, a 40.7% increase year over year. Meanwhile, Fitbit shipped 15.8 million wearable devices, a 21.5% increase year over year.Between Q1 2015 and Q3 2016, Garmin's market share dropped by 40 basis points to 5.7%. During the same 18-month period, Fitbit's market share dropped 980 basis points to 23.0%.Fitbit Stock Continues to DeclineSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and the many others that compete for the 50% market share not held by Fitbit,Xiaomi, Garmin, andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stand to benefit the most.Garmin is a big company and wearables are but one of many revenue streams. A 40-basis-point decline isn't a big deal for a company that generated $2.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5.8%. If not for its auto segment (its largest by revenue), which saw a 17% decline year over year to $656.0 million, 2016 has been a winner.Over at Fitbit, the top line has been outstanding, with revenue growing 39.3% through the first nine months of the year to $1.6 billion. However, it's the bottom line that gets a little wonky.In the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2016, Fitbit's operating profit declined 33.1% to $44.4 million; for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, operating income declined 69.3% to $72.9 million. R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses all have seen huge increases in 2016 as Fitbit struggles to remain on top of a wearables market that's slowing faster than anyone expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recently discussed Fitbit stock in relation to aslowing wearables market; he was pretty blunt in his assessment of the job CEO James Park is doing guiding the company through a rough patch that's seen FIT stock decline by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarketer and IDC both cite smartwatches as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consumers just can't see the need for them as they overlap on features already found in smartphones. And when adding their heftier price tags, smartwatches are a fading fad.""So, what does Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% projection at the start of the year? It buys not one, but two companies that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continues to waste money on bad acquisitions and wasteful overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit's comfy cash position - $672 million in cash and marketable securities as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and marketable securities, no debt, and an operating margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAs for shorting FIT stock, I'm of two minds on this.Yes, theshorts represent almost 36% of its floatand its margins are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it's got to be attractive to somebody in the industry - maybe even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from dropping much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investors buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposition looks like it will be a winner any time soon.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsHere's How Apple Inc.

Apple's Earnings Shine As iPhone 7 Cycle Turns Out Better Than Expected;2/1/2017;"Apple (AAPL) posted a record set of first quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating market expectations on both revenues and earnings, amid a strong uptake for its iPhone 7 smartphones, higher Mac sales and a fast growing services business. Below, we provide some of the key takeaways from Apple's earnings release.We have a$127 price estimate for Apple,which is slightly ahead of the current market price.See Our Complete Analysis For Apple HeremakeArticleAd();iPhone Has A Solid Quarter Amid Shipment And   ASP GrowthShipments of the iPhone touched record highs, growing by 5% year-over-year to about 78.3 million units, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 7 and carrier promotions in the United States. Sales growth could have been higher (~8%) on a sell-through basis, as Apple reduced channel inventory over the quarter. iPhone ASPs came in at a record high of $695 per unit, as the demand mix for the larger 7 Plus was higher compared to previous iterations. Moreover, the increasing shift towards mechanisms such as equipment installment plans and leases, where buyers do not pay anything upfront for their devices, are also helping to skew the demand mix towards higher-tier models. Apple's total revenue guidance for Q2 FY'17 stands at $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion (4% year-over-year at the mid-point). This is relatively strong, considering that the iPhone 7 is largely viewed as a bridge device, with Apple prepping to unveil a completely overhauled 10th anniversary iPhone this fall.Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency   BasisApple's gross margins came in at 38.5% for the quarter. While this was at the high end of the company's guidance range, it was roughly 150 bps lower than last year's figure. There are likely to be two key factors driving this reduction. Firstly, the strong dollar is hurting Apple's price realizations in many key emerging markets. Moreover, there is a possibility that manufacturing costs on the new iPhones are higher, on account of the more advanced components and higher memory capacity per devices. (Related:Apple's Flagship iPhone Keeps Getting More Expensive To Build) However, this is likely to have been partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues (9.1% of total sales, up from 8% last year), which have significantly higher gross margins. Apple is projecting gross margins of between 38% and 39% for Q2 FY'17.Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency   BasisApple's performance in Greater China saw some improvement, driven by a strong uptake for the iPhone 7, which emerged the best selling smartphone in the country during the holiday quarter, as well as double digit growth in iPad shipments. Revenues from the region came in at $16.23 billion, marking a 12% year-over-year decline, amid depreciation of the Chinese Yuan (down 6% year-over-year) as well as a significant decline in sales from Hong Kong.  However, the company says that sales from Mainland China would have actually been up by about 6% on a constant current basis, marking a significant improvement over the firm's performance in the recent quarters.Services Growth Remains Strong, Watch Could Be Gaining   MomentumServices revenues rose by roughly 18% year-over-year to an all time record of $7.17 billion, driven primarily by the App Store, which saw revenues grow by 43% over the quarter and the Apple Music streaming music service. This is positive, considering that the rate of growth in Apple's iDevice installed base is likely to be slowing down, potentially indicating that per-device spending on services is trending upwards. Apple indicated that it was looking to double its services revenues over the next four years. Apple also noted that the Apple Watch had its best quarter ever both in terms of units and revenues, with demand outstripping supply.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and it kicked the year off the right way. Apple set an all-time quarterly revenue record - snapping its streak of declines - and broke its previous iPhone sales record. AAPL stock is up strongly Wednesday morning as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday's show wasn't the iPhone. It was the Services division, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music. Services didn't just set another record - it also posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any AAPL division.Services Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreApple reported that the quarterly revenue for its Services division topped $7.17 billion for Q1, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. If that sounds like a lot of money for what is largely made up of mobile payment transaction fees and digital content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienced its largest-ever subscriber growth in the final quarter of 2016, leading it to post revenue of $2.48 billion.During the AAPL earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook noted that he expects the Services division to bethe size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year. Other key information about the Services division from that earnings call includes:App Store revenue for December alone was a record-setting $3 billionThere are now 2.2 million apps in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to developers in 2016The number of Apple Pay users has tripled over the past year, with transaction volume up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCare and storage services (iCloud) both set all-time recordsApple's music business grew for the third straight quarterWhy Services Revenue is ImportantYou might not know it based on Apple's record-setting iPhone sales this quarter, but selling hardware is tough.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryOnce a consumer has an iPhone in his or her hands, it becomes very difficult to convince them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphone for a new one. In one sense, a huge installed user base - which AAPL has, withmore than 1 billion iOS devices in active use- works against the company. When the iPhone first began to take off, AAPL was selling to people who'd never owned one before. Now, that pool of easy sales is dwindling. And Apple is left in the tougher position of convincing its installed user base to upgrade.Thus the hand-wringing about slowing iPhone sales.Apple's Services division largely benefits from that huge installed user base, though. True, AAPL only gets one shot at selling these customers AppleCare. But once they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explore Apple's other services. They are increasingly adopting Apple Pay. They are in a prime position to buy movies on their Apple TV. They are perfect candidates to subscribe to Apple Music. There are plenty of hooks for storing data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of its millions of apps.Apple's Services revenue doesn't come in big chunks like selling an iPhone. It's $9.99 a month here, 99 cents for an app there, a few cents for a transaction. But it adds up, especially when over a billion customers are generating it.More importantly, that revenue doesn't drop off the same way hardware revenue does when people stop buying new iPhones.Some services - like iCloud and Apple Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keeps automatically billing the customer's card every month regardless of whether their iPhone is brand new or five years old. Apple Pay revenues are increasing as more countries and businesses accept it and iPhone owners grow more accustomed to using it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeople never stop buying apps. They may slow down after the initial rush of a new device, but developers keep bring enticing new games and other apps to the App Store. That means the 1 billion users continue to download.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunJust look at the 40 million-plusSuper Mario Rundownloads from the App Storein only four days.How many iPhones will AAPL sell two years from now? No one knows for sure, but odds are it won't be many more than it does now. On the other hand, Apple is confident its highflying App Store, Apple Pay and other services will see Services division revenue double in that time.The iPhone may have driven Apple stock growth over the past decade. But Services revenue is increasingly important as AAPL stock searches for that elusive next hardware hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatCan Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?The Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe postApple Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?;1/30/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recently plunged to a multi-month low after the   chipmaker was hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andadditional lawsuitsfrom its longtime customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclusively used Qualcomm's   baseband modems in its iPhones between 2011 and 2016, claims that   Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebate payments (compensation for   that deal) after it cooperated with Korean FTC regulators, which   were probing Qualcomm.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();This strained relationship between the two tech giants sounds   like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which started supplying Apple with modems for   the iPhone 7 after its exclusive deal with Qualcomm ended. The   reason is simple -- Apple could potentially buy all of its modems   from Intel if it severs its relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel shares barely budged after Apple sued Qualcomm, and   only recently rallied following its fourth quarter earnings beat.   Let's take a closer look at why investors don't seem convinced   that Qualcomm's pain can generate significant gains for   Intel.Understanding Intel's mobile strategyIntel doesn't report its modem sales separately. They're   included in its massive Client Computing Group, which includes PC   and mobile chips. The group was created in 2015 to divert   attention from the ongoing losses at its mobile division, which   previously reported its results separately. Those losses were   caused by its generous subsidization of OEMs, with co-marketing   agreements, steep discounts, and financial aid for using its   mobile Atom chipsets.By the timeIntel killed offmost of its mobile Atom chips last year, the unit had spent   billions of dollars to capture just 1% of the market. Intel's   fatal mistakes are easy to see in retrospect -- it sold off its   ARM-based Xscale unit in 2006 to focus on x86 chips in 2006, then   rejected Apple's offer to produce application processors for the   first iPhone.Since much of the Android market uses Qualcomm SoCs, which   bundle baseband modems together with ARM-based processors, Intel   realized that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobile   market. Instead, it had to develop modems for OEMs like Apple,   which developed their own ARM-based processors without integrated   modems.Image source: Apple.Why Intel investors aren't excitedThe problem with Intel is that it was likely negotiating terms   with Apple from a position of weakness, due to its need to stay   relevant in the mobile market. Since Intel has a long record of   taking losses to gain market share in the mobile market, it's   reasonable to assume that Intel sold its modems to Apple at very   favorable prices for the hardware maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analysts estimated that the deal   could  generate $1.5 billion in revenues for Intel -- which   would only equal 2.5% of its projected revenues this year. Even   if Apple dropped Qualcomm and doubled its orders from Intel, that   growth wouldn't significantly offset Intel's sluggish growth in   PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modems would likely   only generate low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantly   boost its bottom line growth.To make matters worse, Apple throttled the speed of    Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower speed   of the Intel modems. This indicates that Apple didn't choose   Intel chips because they could match Qualcomm's -- it likely only   did so to reduce Qualcomm's negotiating power. This means that   other OEMs that use stand-alone Qualcomm modems won't likely   switch over to Intel modems anytime soon. This misstep mirrors   Intel's failure in mobile application processors -- several OEMs   initially gave the Atom a chance, but it was doomed by its   inability to match the power efficiency of ARM-based designs.What Intel investors should expectIntel investors shouldn't assume that Apple's battle with   Qualcomm indicates that the two longtime partners will part ways   anytime soon. Apple andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been suing each other for years, yet the   Korean tech giant is still one of its top suppliers. Therefore,   Apple is likely trying to get Qualcomm to lower its chip prices   and licensing fees instead of completely parting ways with the   chipmaker.Even if Apple abandoned Qualcomm, investors shouldn't assume   that Intel will inherit the entire modem business. Apple often   splits component orders from multiple manufacturers, and it has   enough resources to develop its own modems -- which would cut   both Intel and Qualcomm out of the loop.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Gets Extra Help From the Dual Camera iPhone 7 Plus (AAPL);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) first introduced its new, big and bigger smartphones - the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the company opted to offer a few minor features for buyers of the largest model. The 6 Plus had longer battery life, and an image stabilized camera. That basic strategy continued with the 6s Plus in 2015. But last year with the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL included a more significant carrot in the signature Dual Camera feature.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe move of making a key feature exclusive to its larger phones appears to have paid off with a big increase in iPhone 7 Plus sales compared to regular iPhone 7 sales.Having more of the costlier iPhone 7 Plus models in the mix means AAPL can generate more revenue, even if overall unit sales are soft.Differentiating Between Big and BiggerHistorically, the larger-sized iPhone hasn't sold nearly as well as the ""standard"" 4.7-inch model.When AAPL first introduced the two model strategy in 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus had an immediate bump in demand from Apple fans who were hungry for a phablet. It was also very popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphone and tablet, are often preferred. However, overall the bigger and more expensive iPhone 6 Plus only accounted foraround 20% of overall iPhone salesglobally.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL added a little more appeal to the bigger iPhone, adding increased RAM to the optically image stabilized camera for the iPhone 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sales of the bigger model.Last year, Apple rolled the dice: It decided to release a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrade that it heavily promoted as a must-have feature. With this advanced camera system, users could take DSLR-like portraits and optically zoom in on subjects. AAPL made this key feature an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, at the same time boosting the price of its larger iPhone. Previously, it had charged $649 and $749 respectively for the two sizes. In 2016, the company still started the iPhone 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphone feature required shelling out at least $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 Sales See Big Increase in iPhone 7 Plus AdoptionTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus strategy appears to have paid off. Citing numbers from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creative Strategies Inc., theWSJsays that in AAPL's first quarter (ending in December), theiPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for 40% of total iPhone 7 sales, globally.Breaking the numbers down regionally, it's estimated that 52% of Chinese iPhone buyers opted for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it accounted for 47% of total iPhone 7 sales.Why Increased iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 7 Sales MatterThe difference between the two iPhone models is material to AAPL's bottom line.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)It's likely that the iPhone 7 Plus costs Apple more to manufacture than previous Plus versions - it does have more RAM, a larger battery and that dual camera system - but at least some of the additional cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Apple on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus probably remains roughly the same. However, with a base price that's $120 higher, having more Plus models in the mix means that even if overall iPhone 7 sales are soft, the average selling price of a new iPhone goes up. As a result, iPhone revenue could get a boost, despite sales that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticle points out, there's another positive point for AAPL in the iPhone 7 Plus numbers. The fact that pricing the iPhone 7 Plus so high still resulted in big gains for the premium smartphone bodes well for later this year when the company will release the10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 sales numbers indicate that AAPL has additional room to price the iPhone 8 as an ultra-premium, special edition model if it chooses.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Baby Boomers Love These 5 Brands;1/29/2017;"It would seem common sense that a company that has a closer   relationship with its customers would perform better. The Brand   Intimacy report frommarket research firm MBLMconfirms this. The report reveals that if consumers feel a   strong emotional attachment to a brand -- what it terms ""brand   intimacy"" -- that company enjoys better financial results than   those that don't. MBLM reports that the most intimate brands   produce higher revenues and earnings and better stock price   performance than non-intimate brands. The report identifies the   top companies that have most successfully created and sustained   that connection with their customers.Image source: Getty ImagesmakeArticleAd();Baby boomers represent a disproportionate amount of the wealth   and spending among the population. Some estimate that baby   boomers control as much as 70% of the disposable income in the   country. Areport[opens in PDF] issued by Synchrony Financial indicates that as   consumers, the group is fiercely brand loyal, wants seamless   customer service, and is very comfortable shopping using mobile   devices. In preparing its Brand Intimacy Report, MBLM   surveyed 6,000 consumers between 18 and 64 years old. Those aged   55 to 64 were the oldest subset and are likely representative of   the full baby boomer generation, which most people define as   those between 53 and 71 years old. Let's look at the most adored   brands among this demographic from No. 5 to No. 1, according to   the MBLM survey.Image source: Samsung.5.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) : Samsung was bound to make an appearance on   this list, with its No. 1 position in worldwide smartphone   market. Even in the face of theGalaxy Note 7 fiasco, boomers are brand loyal, and as many as 41% of the owners   surveyed indicated they couldn't live without their device and   nearly 82% say they use their device daily. Samsung is also known   for other home electronics such as TVs, which may play into its   popularity.Baby boomers still love their Coke. Image source: Coca-Cola,     Inc.4. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) : Coca-Cola helped keep soldiers supplied with its   soda pop during World War II, distributing over 5 billion bottles    to U.S. service personnel, for whom the company pledged a   price of 5 cents per bottle. It became a staple in the homes that   boomers grew up in. Coke is legendary for heartstring-tugging   advertising campaigns. ""I'd like to buy the world a Coke"" (1971) and ""Thanks, Mean Joe!"" (1979) were iconic ads of their era, and it's no wonder that   baby boomers feel a connection to this brand. It has continued to   use nostalgia in its message, which taps into the brand loyalty.   Food industry activist Marion Nestle toldThe Washington Postin 2015: ""The advertisements are designed to sell happiness.   They're not selling a drink. But on an emotional level you attach   to it.""Image source: Toyota Motor Corporation.3.Toyota(NYSE: TM) : Baby boomers were out to prove that they were not   their parents and were not bound by the ""Buy American"" mindset.   They were concerned with gathering information when making   purchases and having options. They were also part of the 20th   century trend that viewed a car as freedom and an extension of   themselves.  When the US energy crisis arrived in 1973   and caused gas shortages and long lines at the pumps, boomers   embraced Toyotas as fuel-efficient alternatives to their   gas-guzzling American counterparts.  Toyota has also built   its brand on reliability.Image source: Pixabay.2. Levi Strauss & Company: Levi saw its blue jeans gain popularity in the late 1950s and   early 1960s through such movie icons as Marlon Brando and James   Dean. This development led to a boom in popularity among   then-teen baby boomers. Levi's bell bottoms were a staple of the   counter-culture revolution. This loyalty carried into their   adult lives: Fashions changed, but Levi's remained the same. Baby   boomers are known for their steadfast brand loyalty, and Levi's   have been with them every step of the way.Image source: Amazon.com.1. Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) : Are you surprised that this e-commerce behemoth   is the most beloved by baby boomers? Consider these statistics   from Synchrony Financial: they spend more time online than their   millennial counterparts, with 51% spending 15 hours per week   online, compared with only 41% of millennials. A more telling   statistic is that 70% of boomers report using Amazon at least   once per month. With more money and more time, this demographic   is embracing e-commerce, and nobody is bigger than Amazon.   Boomers want a variety of products and want to be able to find   them. Sounds like a description of Amazon in a nutshell.If this list reveals one thing, it is that there are many ways   to connect with consumers on a visceral level: nostalgia,   utility, or just being where they are. There is no one method   that works across the board. Equally, there is no silver bullet   or single metric one can use when looking to find a winning   investment. There are many data points that should be considered,   and the concept of brand intimacy is merely one additional tool   in an investor's toolkit.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

However, Skyworks does have   an Achilles heel that investors should be aware of.   Apple is responsible for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue, which is a blessing and a curse. When iPhone sales are   booming, Skyworks' results soar. However, when the Mac maker   decides to reduce its channel inventory, Skyworks reallyfeels the pain.While Skyworks has been signing deals in recent years to help   reduce its customer concentration, Apple is such a huge component   of Skyworks revenue that these two companies will remain attached   at the hip -- for better or worse -- for the foreseeable   future.The case for InfineraInfinera is a fast growing player in the   optical networking equipment market. The company's products   make internet providers lives easier by allowing them to easily   (and cheaply) move vast quantities of data around the globe.Like Skyworks, Infinera has also benefited from a number of   tech trends. The rise of cloud computing and streaming high-def   video is making it difficult for providers to keep up with   demand. That's forcing them to invest huge sums of money to   expand their networks, which has been a boon to Infinera's   business.Image source: Getty Images.That's a wonderful backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledover the last few quarters to translate that bandwidth   demand growth into financial success. While there are several   factors to blame, one of the biggest problems is   competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- has caught up to Infinera's   technological edge and has been eating the company's lunch as of   late. While Infinera's management is aware of the problem and is   investing heavily to recapture its edge, it might be a long-haul   until the company returns to top-line growth.Of course, those worries have now beenpriced into the company's stock, so investors could be in a position to win big if the company   can grow faster than market watchers expect.The better buyWhile I'm hopeful that Infinera can right its ship, there are   never any guarantees of success. For that reason, I think that   the better choice for investors today is Skyworks. Not only does   Skyworks promise high growth rates ahead, but it is already so   profitable that it pays out a fast-growing dividend and still   has enough cash left over tobuy back boatloads of stock. As long as the company can continue to make progress at fixing   its customer concentration issues, then its future is looking   quite bright.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting forSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. NowVentureBeatsays it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. Thatevent took place last week.Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery ConcernsAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The Guardian, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to alate March release date. Yesterday,VentureBeat'sEvan Blassclaimed to have specifics, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.Galaxy S8 DetailsTheVentureBeatreport also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlikeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, theadvanced AI personal assistantSamsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)Interestingly,VentureBeatsays the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.The Importance of the Galaxy S8 LaunchIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare haddropped 13.5%compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Here’s Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's no longer the mid-1990's, but if you've blinked, you might have missed how quicklyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) transformed from a slow-moving bellwether to fast-growing tech company again.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrAnd this time, Windows and Office - while still huge money makers for the company - are not the products doing the heavy lifting. And thatbodes wellfor MSFT stock.The Nadella EffectNew CEO Satya Nadella deserves much of the credit for the turnaround in Microsoft and MSFT stock. Since Nadella was was appointed as CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, Microsoft shares have skyrocketed as much as 75%, when factoring its 52-week high of $64.10 reached on Dec. 23.That comes out to 25% annual returns. And for a number of catalysts currently in play, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering some 25% returns.Not only has the market rewarded Nadella for moving Microsoft toward high-growth areas such as the cloud with Office 365 and the company's dominant Azure platform, Nadella has - in the process - made investors forget Microsoft's failures under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Notably, missing out on mobile and being surpassed by the likes ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut thanks to Nadella's strong pulse on the company, Microsoft won't miss out on anymore opportunities.The M&A EffectTake, for example, last week'sacquisition of Simplygon, a company that develops 3D-optimization solutions for video game developers and other industries that need to visualize 3D data. Microsoft didn't reveal how much it paid for Simplygon, not that its price is important. What matters is the extent to which this deal can help Microsoft leverage its existing ""3D to everyone"" initiative, which makes it easy to capture, create and share in 3D images.The deal for Simplygon follows last Friday's deal for artificial intelligence (AI) startupMaluuba, which specializes in deep learning and reinforcement learning. And to say nothing about its $26.2 billion blockbuster deal for LinkedIn Corp, which closed in December.With almost $140 billion in cash on its balance sheet, there's not much Microsoft can't afford. And Satya seems determined to deploy the company's cash to ensure Microsoft's growth never peaks.Bottom Line on MSFT StockMicrosoft stock - currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 19 - deserves a higher multiple. With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of Internet of Things, smart homes, the cloud and now 3D and AI, MSFT stock - despite trading near all-time highs - still looks attractive.The LinkedIn deal, which exposes Microsoft to a new set of growth areas such as advertising, putting it in the realm ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), deserves an additional three to four points above Microsoft's current P/E.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewLooking out to the next 12 to 18 months, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75, when assigning a P/E of 23 (compared to Facebook's 24) to fiscal 2017 estimates of the $3.27 per share.Aside from delivering 10% earnings growth in 2017, MSFT stock pays a 2.5% dividend yield, making it one of the better bargains in tech.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold any a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCan the Shark Tank Make These 3 Canadian Stocks Great Again?The 3 Best Under-the-Radar Trump Stocks to BuyThe postHere's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75appeared first onInvestorPlace."

If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;1/25/2017;"Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();If I could only buy one stock right now, then there are a few   boxes that stock needs to check. I'd like the holding to be   relatively safe in a tumultuous time but still look likely to   generate modest short-term growth, while having the potential for   exceptional long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a   robust balance sheet and be relatively cheap in this expensive   market -- and is a little dividend too much to ask?For all of that, look no further thanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Short-term growth prospects look goodApple's finances are massive in almost every way, with sales   in the fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sales and   earnings actually slowed during the during quarter, down 9% and   19%, respectively, but the company has guided for a return to   sales growth in fiscal Q1.Some Apple bears have pointed to the company's reliance on its   iPhone -- which made up about two-thirds of sales in the most   recent quarter -- and that those sales are starting to slow as   the phone seems to be saturating the addressable market. The   average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone segment has fallen   slightly year over year.However, the iPhone could have plenty of growth left. The new   iPhone 7 launched in late 2016 seems to be performing very well   already and should help to boost ASP once again. Additionally,   the issues with the explodingSamsungGalaxy Note 7, which has even been banned on all U.S.   aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhone sales the highest   yet.Image source: Apple.The bears also point to nascent growth in most of Apple's   other products, such as its personal computers, iPads, and the   Apple Watch. One other area that's growing impressively is the   services segment, which includes revenue from services such as   iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Pay. This segment's revenue grew 24%   year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, making up 13%   of total revenue as Apple's second largest segment by sales   behind the iPhone segment. Services are increasingly important,   as the total number of Apple products in use continues to grow   each quarter, meaning more devices that are likely linked to an   Apple account and could help services revenue to continue growing   nicely.Apple's robust financial positionWhile Apple's sales and earnings have come under pressure, its   cash growth has not. Apple's operating cash flow in the most   recent quarter surged to $16 billion, a new company record for   that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the company   has grown its total cash and investments to $238 billion, more   than a third of its market cap, and aboutdouble the next wealthiest company in the United   States.Unfortunately for Apple's capital expenditure advocates, about   90% of that money is stored out of the U.S., as the company has   resisted paying heavy repatriation taxes to bring it back home.   However, President Trump has signaled that he'd like to offer a   much lower tax rate, maybe as low as 10%, for companies in   Apple's position that are seeking to send huge chunks of money   home. There are certainly other risks for Apple in some of   Trump's proposed tax ideas, such as potential import tariffs on   goods manufactured overseas, but this one point is important for   what it could mean for Apple's cash available for immediate   use.Long-term growth potentialApple's new wireless headphones, called ""air pods."" Image     source: Apple.Apple's modest short-term growth on continued incremental   innovations and execution is encouraging, but it's much more fun   to consider Apple's moonshot long-term growth possibilities.   Apple increased its research and development spend by about 25%   to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.Speaking of the company's huge cash position, there are a few   fun reckless predictions we can make about what the company might   spend that money on developing. Self-driving cars, virtual   and augmented reality, and more recently original content for   iTunes are all areas of growth that tech industry analysts are   looking for from Apple.My favorite reckless prediction is that Apple will begin   competing more heavily in artificial intelligence. Apple's Siri   was one of the first voice-based search tools beforeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) entered the space with their smart   home voice-activated devices.Amazon and Google beat Apple to market with their home   assistant devices, but Apple isn't known for being an early   market mover -- rather, Apple has a knack for swooping in with   amazing products that in turn dominate the market that's already   there. Let's not forget that Amazon and Google have ventured into   Apple's world with their consumer electronics much more than   Apple would be venturing into theirs with its own artificial   intelligence assistant.WhyApple stockstill looks like a great buyFinally, in terms of valuation, Apple still looks cheap. Even   though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it's still   trading at just 14 times earnings. Compare that with around 25   times earnings on average for the S&P 500, Google at 30, and   Amazon at 185. Also, Apple stock has run up quickly lately, but   it's still down from its high of around $135 in mid-2015, so its   recent run doesn't look unreasonable.Add to that a relatively cheap valuation, as well as all of   the points covered here, that Apple stock also pays a 2% dividend   yield, which could very well rise as Apple deploys more of its   huge cash load in 2017. The best investment strategy is one   that's well diversified, but for all of those points -- if I   could only buy one stock, Apple continues to look like a great   stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Reviewing Samsung's Q4 2016 Figures And What Lies Ahead;1/24/2017;"Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) published its Q4 2016 results on Tuesday, posting its highest operating profit in over three years, as a strong market for semiconductor products and the depreciation of the Korean Won helped the company overcome some setbacks faced by its smartphone division, following the discontinuation of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphones in Q3. While overall revenues remained almost flat at53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion), operating profits expanded by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion). Samsung expects earnings to improve in 2017, as the company takes advantage of strong semiconductor pricing and stable demand, although the smartphone unit could face some challenges, amid higher marketing costs, slowing global smartphone shipment growth and mounting competition. Below we take a look at some of the key factors that drove Samsung's performance over the last quarter and what to expect in 2017.We have a$1,340 price estimate for Samsung Electronics, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.See our complete analysis for SamsungmakeArticleAd();SemiconductorUnit Outperforms On Tight Supply And Samsung's High-End FocusSamsung's semiconductor business had a solid quarter, with revenues rising by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and operating profits growing by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven largely by the memory business. Supply-demand conditions in the memory market have been tight, with mobile OEMs increasing memory content on devices, effectively bolstering demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is seeing some under-supply, as major vendors have been reducing their production mix in favor of mobile DRAM, boosting prices. While Samsung has been benefiting from the broader market tailwinds, the company's technology edge and its focus on higher value products also appear to be paying off.For instance, Samsung is focusing on high density/performance DRAM over commodity DRAM, while expanding process migration to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is looking improve its process technologies further in 2017, migrating to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, driving down costs. The company's system LSI business, which manufactures processors, also aided Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expected to be an important year for the LSI division, as Samsung looks to ramp-up production of the next generation 10-nm products from its foundry operations. These chips, which could be a fixture of high-end smartphones in 2017, are touted to be more battery efficient, while offering better performance and a smaller form factor.Smartphone Business Largely Shrugs Off Note 7 ImpactSamsung's smartphone division fared reasonably well, despite the Note 7 recall which occurred in late Q3. Although segment revenues declined by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), operating profits rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profitability for the quarter was aided by strong sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sales of its mid-range smartphones such as the A and J series. That said, things are likely to remain subdued over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increasing its marketing spending in order to rebuild its brand following the Note 7 crisis.  Moreover, the company's upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship is likely to launch in Q2, moving away from the March launch cycle that the company adopted with the S7. The upcoming device will be crucial to Samsung, as the company looks to restore its image as a vendor of cutting-edge smartphones, while contending with increasing competition in the high-end of the smartphone market as Apple preps to launch a completely redesigned iPhone later this year, while Google ramps up sales and distribution of its critically acclaimed Pixel devices.

Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Stock Is Still a Winner in 2017 and Beyond;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGrowth stocks can be rewarding investment instruments due to their ability to captivate investors with market-beating growth. On the flipside, the downside risk presented by such stocks can be huge once the growth narrative ends. One such stock that fits this profile isApplied Materials, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMAT), the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor equipment.Source:Mattia Accornero via FlickrApplied Materials operates in the highly cyclical semiconductor business where it sells chip manufacturing equipment to some of the world's largest chip foundries, includingSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM).makeArticleAd();Sweet Spot for AMAT StockApplied Materials is currently in a sweet spot where it's enjoying a cyclical upturn in fab equipment spending. A cyclical upturn frequently lasts for three or so years before growth peters out and the trend is eventually reversed.The yo-yo nature of the semiconductor space is clearly reflected in AMAT stock. After receiving a shellacking in 2015 due to tepid growth, Applied Materials turned the heat on in 2016 and managed to finish as the second biggest gainer in the Nasdaq behind onlyNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).AMAT stock has strong top- and bottom-line growth to thank for the superb gains after finishing the year with revenue growth of 12% and earnings-per-share growth of 37%.Applied Materials has kicked off the new year in high gear, managing to outpace the technology sector and the market. Although the technology sector as a whole is expected to perform well in 2017, AMAT stock has already outpaced theTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) with gains of 5.6% vs 3.3% year-to-date, respectively. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), of which AMAT is the biggest weighting, has managed a modest 3.1% gain.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundThis suggests that the market is counting on AMAT to continue growing in 2017.Increased Equipment SpendingNumerical navel-gazers, Gartner and SEMI World Fab Forecast, have predicted that fab equipment spending will return to decent growth in 2017 and 2018.Gartner has predictedthat worldwide semiconductor and equipment spending will grow by 9.9% and 11.4% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Meanwhile,SEMI has forecast10.6% growth in 2017.There are three reasons why the semiconductor sector experiences revenue cycles:Capital spending ups and downsDemand slowdownsProcess migrationCapital spending is the big variable here in this predictable sequence. When semiconductor companies are seeing strong demand and profits are flowing, they tend to invest heavily in new manufacturing capacity. This added capacity usually fully ramps up in about two years, and almost inevitably results in oversupply of chips in the market.This oversupply crimps prices and forces manufacturers to cut capex and equipment spending. This in turn leads to lower supply of chips in the market, which culminates in higher chip prices and sets off another cycle of heavy equipment purchases.In Applied Material's case, capital spending increases and process migration are currently acting as the company's main growth drivers. A sharp ramp up in 3D NAND production by companies such asMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) as well as heavy DRAM and Flash investments by Samsung and other companies are driving aggressive increases in manufacturing capacity.4 Retail Stocks That Will Make It or Break It     in 2017Meanwhile, transition to newer processes such as 10nm and 7nm nodes byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and GlobalFoundries has been driving demand for leading-edge machines that can manufacture these chips.AMAT said in its full-year report that it expects revenue to grow 45% and EPS to expand 154% during the first quarter of 2017. That's a great way to set the pace for the rest of the year.Bottom Line on AMAT StockInvestors can be forgiven for feeling jittery about a stock that rallied 73% in 2016. But the silver lining is that Applied Materials is sitting on a strong cyclical upturn in equipment spending. This is likely to drive robust earnings growth and support another strong rally in 2017 and perhaps beyond that. This might be the right time to load up on AMAT stock.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     201710 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackThe postApplied Materials, Inc.

Should NVIDIA Corporation Be Scared of Samsung's Automotive Potential?;1/23/2017;"Despite being a leader in the discrete graphics processing   unit (GPU) market,NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has kept an eye on the future. The company has   been focusing on emerging trends such as autonomous cars by   partnering with the likes ofTesla Motorsto deploy its self-driving technology, powered by deep   learning and artificial intelligence.Due to its progress in the automotive sector, revenue from   this business increased more than 60% year-over-year during the   most recently reported quarter. Though this segment represents   just over 6% of total revenue at present, its large potential   should not be ruled out. However, the road to automotive glory is   not going to be smooth for NVIDIA, as it will have to face   formidable competition in the form ofSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andHarman International(NYSE: HAR) .Samsung's big moveLast November, Samsungannouncedthat it will be acquiring Harman International for $8 billion.   This is the South Korean giant's big bet on the future of   automotive technology -- connected cars. The acquisition, which   is expected to be complete by mid-2017, will complement Samsung's   existing automotive efforts.makeArticleAd();Currently, Samsung makes memory technology for vehicle   systems, such as NAND, DRAM, and memory controllers. The company   is also focused on developing object recognition systems through   its CMOS image sensor division that can be used in advanced   driver assistance applications. According to Samsung, ""Samsung   Industry CIS can be used to empower various Advanced Driver   Assistance System (ADAS) technologies including Multi Camera 360   view, Parking Assistance, Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure   Warning, and others.""Image source: Samsung.Harman, on the other hand, has a number of embedded   infotainment solutions ranging from object detection to   navigation that are used by big automakers. By acquiring Harman,   Samsung can now develop integrated vehicle technologies under one   roof. More importantly, Samsung will get its hands on Harman's   Life-Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle Solution, or LIVS, which was   launched in 2016.LIVS is an end-to-end connected car solution that includes   features such as intelligent learning navigation and   camera-enabled driver assistance systems. Additionally, LIVS also   provides a comprehensive security architecture using a firewall   and a hypervisor, while also allowing over-the-air updates to   connected car systems to protect them from hacker attacks.This LIVS platform serves as competition to NVIDIA's DRIVE PX2   platform. Using the DRIVE PX2, vehicles can automate driving on   the highway by using sensors and cameras. The NVIDIA system is   based on real-time inputs that are powered by sensors, deep   learning, and surrounding vision.More importantly, NVIDIA has already gained validation for   this technology, as the DRIVE PX2 is used by Tesla Motors in all   of its models. On the other hand, Harman's LIVS platform is still   in the concept phase. However, since Harman is deeply embedded   into the automotive space with a variety of customers, the   company could accelerate deployment of the platform once it is   ready.Why Harman enjoys an advantage over NVIDIAThough NVIDIA reported rapid growth in its automotive efforts   last quarter, the company brought in just $127 million in revenue   from this segment. By comparison, almost two-thirds of Harman's   $7 billion in revenue last year came from sales of automotive   components. What's more, the company has a backlog of $24 billion   in sales.As a result, Harman has actually has the stronger position in   the automotive market, with clients such as Mercedes-Benz,Volkswagen,BMW, Jaguar, and even Tesla. In fact, the audio system in the Model   S was developed by s1nn, which is a subsidiary of Harman   International. The company seems to have even deeper   relationships with automakers than NVIDIA.How will NVIDIA respond?Samsung's expertise in hardware and chip manufacturing will   pair nicely with Harman's existing automotive features and client   base. Together, they can leverage Harman's LIVS platform to power   advanced driver assistance systems and compete against NVIDIA's   DRIVE PX2 platform, which has yet to gain widespread   adoption.NVIDIA, however, can accelerate its own automotive development   since it has beengranted permissionby the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test on public   roads. NVIDIA can now gather more data through its autonomous   technology, which will support the development of the company's   next-generation autonomous platform, known as Xavier.Xavier is expected to go into testing by the end of 2017 and   could hit the ground running, as NVIDIA is working on the   existing DRIVE PX2 platform with the likes ofAudi. In fact, NVIDIA and Audi plan to put a Level 4 autonomous car   on the market by 2020.

Energous Corp (WATT) Stock Bombs After Brutal Report;1/23/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEnergous Corp(NASDAQ:WATT) stock is only for the crazy ones, as it continues a   roller-coaster movement that has seen the stock edge out a gain   of 5.1% this year. Today, WATT stock is getting hammered, albeit   gently, for a stock that traders usually swing violently by the   hind legs.Shares of Energous were chugging along with the rest of the   broader market, when suddenly WATT stock took a turn for the   worst, dropping more than 5% in the span of minutes. The unlikely   culprit? A report published onSeeking Alphaentitled""Energous Corporation: Game Over.""makeArticleAd();Certainly, opinionated news like that can't budge a behemoth   likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but for the $338 million Energous, any news is a vine for   stock traders to swing on.But Seeking Alpha's report is a doozy, alleging that Energous   is in way over its head and WATT stockholders are equally   clueless:""Nonetheless, logic and facts have thus far failed to   influence a retail investor base suffering from the most extreme   cognitive dissonance we have witnessed since Uni-Pixel or OCZ   Technology Group. The WATT bull case has eschewed substance, and   instead focused on the ""tea leaves"" of an Apple iPhone 8 wireless   charging design win.""It wasn't long ago that WATT stock saw a huge surge based on a   speculated partnership with Apple Inc., which SA believes to be   the only bull case for Energous - ""an iPhone 8 wireless charging   design win.""10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       2017However, Apple's latest patent filing are at odds with this.   In its more than 16 patent applications for wireless charging, SA   notes that Apple is focused on inductive charging, not the   RF-based technology used by Energous:""This novel approach would eliminate today's wireless charging   pads that require devices maintain specific points of contact and   orientation. Apple diagrams clearly illustrate how iPhones and   iPads will elegantly turn an entire surface into an inductive   charging platform.""Energous' charging is slightly different, allowing for   wire-free charging through the air on any number of devices in   the room. The tech in question is also a regulatory hurdle that   WATT has yet to pass, as it hasn't been shown to not be a health   detriment.At any rate, SA's report rightly concludes that Apple is   rarely a first-mover, and that its inductive tech, while in the   works for some time, is likely to be revealed alongside the   iPhone 8.IDTI,a supplier of inductive wireless charging chips for Apple's   Watch andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), has previously mentioned Apple's intent to use its own tech   for iPhone wireless charging.The harshest reality, however, is Apple's dismissal of WATT's   technology as ""inefficient"" and a health hazard (due to radiation   no less) in a 2013 patent application for desktop wireless   charging.Free Profits in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock       After EarningsEnergous stock was down 4.01% as of the close … but I'd   expect the WATT stock bulls to continue undeterred for the most   part.$WATTtook this pic a few years ago, how I feel today haha.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is the Uber of E-Commerce;1/23/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Chairman ofAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), Jack Ma,dismissedthe notion that his company is the ""Amazon of China."" Rather, he calledAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) an ""empire"" since the company is obsessively focused on controlling everything, such with its warehouses and logistics.Source: ShutterstockFor Ma, this is really much different than the BABA way. He believes his company is instead a marketplace, which involves a massive ecosystem of partners. As he puts it: ""Our philosophy is to empower others to sell, empower others to service, making sure the other people are more powerful than us.""makeArticleAd();Yes, in a way, this is kind of likeUber, right? I think so. The asset-light strategy can allow for faster growth, nimbler actions and much higher margins.BABA Stock and the Uber ApproachOK then, but what does this mean for investors in Alibaba stock? Is the Uber approach enough for there to be continued strong returns?Well, first of all, there is no doubt that BABA stock is highly profitable, which is in stark contrast to Amazon. In the latestquarter, Alibaba reported a sizzling 55% jump in revenues to $5.14 billion and net income spiked by 66% to $1.14 billion.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     RetirementWhile the bulk of BABA stock's revenues came from ecommerce, the company has also been showing strong gains in other categories like cloud computing (revenues more than doubled to $224 million) and entertainment (the top line more than tripled to $541 million). Oh, and the company has continued to gain traction with mobile, which represented 79% of ecommerce revenues. In all, there are 450 million mobile monthly active users.Granted, there are major risks to Alibaba stock. It can be tough to manage the complexities of an ecosystem, such as by dealing with issues like quality and customer service. Such things have dogged companies likeeBay Inc(NASDAQ:EBAY).At the same time, there are political issues. And this is not just about the uncertainty regarding the potential adverse reactions from the Chinese government. Of course, BABA stock is also vulnerable to Donald Trump - who has certainly not been shy about his anti-China policies. There could easily be higher tariffs and other adverse actions that could make it tougher for companies to engage in trade.Kind of grim for Alibaba stock, huh? Perhaps so. But the conventional wisdom may actually turn out to be wrong. After all, Trump has taken a tough approach on Europe too. In other words, there may be more temptation for these countries to focus on China - moving away from the U.S. The same could happen in South America.If so, China may wind up becoming an even more important economic power. And this seems reasonable since the country has a rapidly growing middle class, whichiResearch Reportforecasts will jump from 109 million in 2015 to a whopping 830 million by 2030.What's more, the population is rapidly going digital. Again, based on data from iResearch Report, the total retail e-commerce transaction volume in China is forecasted to go from $609 billion in 2015 to $1.46 trillion by 2020. That's a compound annual growth rate of 19.2%.According toInvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn: ""China's consumers are hard-working, hungry for value and conservative in the best possible way. That's because they're all first-generation middle class. They treasure their new status, they're very supportive of stability, and since they're Chinese they're numerous.""Bottom Line on Alibaba StockNow, it's true that Alibaba stock has been volatile. Since coming public in October 2014, the shares hit a high of $115 and a low of $59.Samsung (SSNLF): TWO Different Battery Failures     on Galaxy Note 7Although, at current levels, the valuation is fairly reasonable.  Consider that BABA stock is at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24X.  By comparison,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) trades at 25X andBaidu Inc(ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) sports a multiple of 31X.But more importantly, when taking a long-term view, Alibaba stock looks like a good way to play the megatrends in China. What's more, the shares may even be a hedge if Trump's China policies ultimately backfire.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Samsung (SSNLF): TWO Different Battery Failures on Galaxy Note 7;1/23/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) held a press conference this weekend that was buried by coverage of the U.S. presidential inauguration and the Women's March on Washington. The company announced the final results of its Galaxy Note 7 investigation, and according to Samsung, there was not one buttwoseparate Galaxy Note 7 battery flaws to blame.Source:Sylwia Bartyzel Via UnsplashThe second was introduced in the replacement battery after the initial issue was discovered.makeArticleAd();Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Testing MarathonIt was pretty obvious once Galaxy Note 7s started bursting into flames that the battery was involved. But when the problems continued with replacement smartphones using a new battery from a different supplier, suddenly the root cause got murkier.At thepress conference, Samsung explained just how deeply it investigated the Galaxy Note 7.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackEverything from the new USB-C port, to wireless charging and even software overload was closely studied and eliminated as a factor. So was Samsung's manufacturing process. The company built four test facilities (one at each site where it assembled the doomed smartphone) and put 700 engineers to work testing 200,000 Galaxy Note 7s plus 30,000 Galaxy Note 7 battery packs on their own. External testers from three different firms were also added to the teams.Exploding Galaxy Note 7 Battery Cause: Almost UnbelievableThe result?It turns out that SSNLF got hit by an almost unbelievable coincidence.In its rush to take advantage of the expected low-keyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 launch, it used a battery sourced from an unnamed supplier, that had a hidden design flaw. The battery lacked sufficient space to expand and contract - as batteries do - when charging and discharging. As a result, the battery's electrodes could touch, then short circuit. This issue was not caught by the battery manufacturer.Samsung pointed out that for its own quality assurance team to have noticed the problem, they would have had to X-Ray the batteries.Batteries from a second supplier (also un-named) used in some Galaxy Note 7s were fine. They became the go-to replacement batteries once the first wave of trouble began. However, Samsung then pushed that second supplier to dramatically increase its Galaxy Note 7 battery production volume.The demand to quickly churn out 10 million batteries overwhelmed that company's production capability and manufacturing defects crept in. A faulty internal weld could cause these replacement batteries to also short circuit and again, the defect was not visible.Samsung's Safety Pledge and the Galaxy S8Samsung took full responsibility for the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco, admitting that it had pushed suppliers and the limits of the manufacturing process.Going forward, the company is implementing an8-point battery safety checkthat includes accelerated usage testing, durability tests, X-Ray examination and physically disassembling the batteries.In recognition that lithium-ion batteries can be extremely volatile, Samsung has also committed to leaving more space around the battery packs in its smartphones going forward. While this runs contrary to the ""thinner at all cost"" mentality that Samsung and Apple have been pursuing, additional buffer space will protect the battery from impacts.In aninterview with Recode, Samsung's mobile division head said: ""I wish [that] this serves as an opportunity to improve safety of lithium-ion not only for Samsung but for the entire industry.""Samsung also made it clear that the Galaxy S8 - due for release this spring - will be covered by the enhanced battery safety procedures.Bank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational     Exuberance Will EndThat Galaxy S8 launch will be the critical test of whether SSNLF truly recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco. The chapter is estimated to havecost the company $10 billion, Samsung stock took a hit (although strong performance by its chips division more than made up for that) and its brand was damaged.If consumers accept Samsung's findings, apology and pledge to prevent this from happening in the future, the Galaxy S8 could see a sales rebound. If the Galaxy Note 7 battery episode still surrounds the company, Apple's iPhone 8 stands a chance of clawing back share from Android when it launches in the fall and the Samsung's place on top of the Android pyramid could ultimately be in doubt.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Intel Corporation Executive Wants to Rename Its Next Big Manufacturing Jump;1/11/2017;"At the J.P. Morgan 15th Annual Tech Forum,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC)  client computing group (CCG) chief Navin   Shenoy offered up some insights about his business unit, the   company's largest by revenue.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Near the end of his presentation, Shenoy talked about Intel's   chip manufacturing strategy, exuding confidence that the   company's manufacturing technology is the ""best in the world.""As part of this discussion, he took the time to explain how   the technology that Intel calls 14 nanometers is more like what   its competitors --Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(NYSE: TSM) -- call 10 nanometers (smaller is generally believed   to be better).He then offered the following commentary with respect to its   upcoming 10-nanometer technology (emphasis mine): ""I'm confident   that when 10 nanometer -- our 10 nanometer -- comes out,and this is something that maybe we should rename it, I   don't know, we'll think about that, but when our 10 nanometer comes out, we will have a clear   density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage   versus what others in the industry have.""I agree, and evensuggested that Intel do just that back in   October.Since this is something that Intel seems to be considering   now, it would be wise to just do it. Here's why.Lots of benefit, little risk/effortIn the past, when Intel had a full-generation lead in   manufacturing technology over its peers, it was easy for the   company to stick to its own naming schemes, even if it served to   undersell the characteristics of the underlying technology.For example, Intel's 14-nanometer technology was generally   ahead of what its competitors were calling 14/16-nanometer   technologies. The chipmaker may have been able to score some   additional marketing points by rebranding its technology as   10-nanometer to make this superiority clear, but -- at the time   -- that naming methodology didn't create the perception that   Intel is a generation behind.If Intel could get to market with future technologies (10   nanometer, 7 nanometer, etc.) at the same time as its competitors   got to their respective technologies going forward, then Intel   could leave its naming scheme unchanged -- again, short-changing   itself, but not giving competitors opportunities to say that they   are ahead.But that's not going to be the case going forward. Intel's   14-nanometer technology will be the company's only   production-worthy technology over the next year. Its competitors,   on the other hand, will ramp up their respective 10-nanometer   technologies in 2017, and Taiwan Semiconductor plans to ramp up   its 7-nanometer technology beginning in early 2018, right around   when we will see Intel bring its 10-nanometer technology to   market.Intel will then go from squandering a potential marketing   point, but at least appearing competitive, to flat-out looking as   though it is a generation behind. Intel's competitors will surely   use this against the chipmaker as they craft their own marketing   messages, which are likely to be carried far and wide by the tech   press.The easiest argument for renamingIntel's marketing/PR team will have two basic options for how   to educate people about how the company isn't actually a full   generation behind what its chip manufacturing peers (and their   customers -- Intel's direct competitors) are fielding.Intel can rename its technologies to accurately reflect     their competitiveness.Intel can spend undue time and energy arguing that its     technologies are competitive despite being branded in such a     way as to suggest that they are behind the curve.One of these options is a very easy solution to the problem   that has virtually no downside. The other is much more   complicated, has the potential to come off as damage control, and   might not even work (Intel's attempts to explain why its   14-nanometer technology is superior to competing 14/16-nanometer   technologies have often fallen on deaf ears in the tech   community).If Intel loses a single chip sale because it refused to do   something as simple as renaming its manufacturing technologies,   then that would be a wholly unnecessary destruction of   shareholder value.Do the right thing, Intel: Rename your future manufacturing   technologies, beginning with your next-generation 10-nanometer   technology.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's All the New IoT Technology TDK Corp. Will Get From Buying InvenSense;1/11/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Towards the end of 2016,TDK Corporation(NASDAQOTH: TTDKY) struck a deal to acquireInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) for $1.33 billion. The acquisition was made, in   part, to boost TDK's Internet of Things (IoT) opportunities,   which is now looking like an even smarter move than before, with   InvenSense's recent release of new IoT technologies last   week.IoT is expected to be a $7.1 trillion market by 2020, and TDK   is hoping to use InvenSense' micro electro-mechanical sensors, or   MEMS, to help the company transition from the mobile market to   the IoT.makeArticleAd();So, here's all the new technology InvenSense just released   that could help make that a reality for TDK.The world's first seven-axis motion sensorInvenSense said last week that it has started production of   the world's first seven-axis motion sensor, called the ICM-20789.   The company said the product builds on InvenSense's successful   6-axis motion sensor by adding a new pressure sensor into the   mix.The ICM-20789 will be marketed primarily to the prosumer and   smart drone market (part of the broader IoT) to improve flight   take-off and landings, as well as improve stability when a drone   is in hover mode by implementing accurate elevation control.   InvenSense's motion sensors are some of the best in the business,   and this new one with a pressure sensor could become the standard   for smart drones.Microphone for home IoT devicesThe company debuted a new signal-to-noise (SNR) 74-decibel   analog microphone that InvenSense said can be used for in-home   and Internet of Things devices. The new mic provides very low   noise audio capturing and can be used with beamforming and audio   processing algorithms.Voice commands have become the go-to way to communicate with   home IoT devices (think Amazon's Echo and Google Home), so   focusing on high-end microphones for these types of devices could   help InvenSense -- and eventually TDK -- make more inroads into   the IoT component segment.The ICS-40730 is only available for sampling right now,   but InvenSense said it'll enter mass production in the third   quarter of this year.6-axis motion sensor specially tuned for wrist-worn     wearablesAn important part of the consumer IoT market is wrist-worn   wearables, primarily fitness bands and smartwatches.InvenSense isn't new to the wrist-worn space, but the newly   tuned ICM-20648 combines 3-axis gyroscope sensors and 3-axis   accelerometer sensors with the company's updated software stack   to improve step count and activity classification (walk, run,   bike, sitting still) in wrist-worn wearables.The sensor also incorporates a ""Bring-to-See"" (B2S) capability   much like theAppleWatch's, where power is conserved in the device by having the   screen off until a wearer raises her arm to view the device.The company says adding all of these capabilities into its   wearable tech sensor will speed up time-to-market timelines for   original equipment manufacturers and will be available in the   second quarter of this year.Continued integration with more IoT platformsInvenSense announced that its SensorStudio graphical software   development tool can now connect toSamsung's Artik IoT platform to make it easier to program sensors and   algorithms for IoT devices.The company said in a press release that, ""The integrated   Samsung Artik Smart IoT platform provides the fastest path to   secure, interoperable, and intelligent IoT products and   services.""InvenSense said that SensorStudio and its FireFly ICM-30670   Development Kit are now compatible with Artik, and that the   integration ""helps our customers transmit their sensors &   algorithms outputs faster"" with end-to-end security.Partnerships and compatibility are a big part of the IoT, as   many companies have gone in their own direction and set their own   standards. With the InvenSense/Samung announcement, InvenSense is   signaling to the IoT market that it wants its components to be   integrated with platforms designed by other companies.What all of this means for TDKTDK already sells some of its sensors, and it said when it   made its acquisition bid for InvenSense that, ""Sensors are viewed   as an important IoT-enabling technology, and TDK envisions   greatly expanding this portion of its business and providing a   broad range of sensor solutions to its customers.""The company is looking to transition from a smartphone   component supplier to an IoT leader, and it called the Internet   of Things the ""next big technology wave that we will be riding"".    With the new InvenSense technologies listed above (which   will soon become TDK's) and the company's current sensor tech, it   appears the company is on the right path to see that plan play   out.10 stocks we like better than InvenSenseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation PC Chief Talks Manufacturing Strategy;1/9/2017;"Earlier this month, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) formally unveiled a set of new microprocessors   targeted at the personal-computer market known as theseventh-generation Core processor family.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();These chips, as would be expected, deliver improved   performance and power efficiency relative to the company's   sixth-generation Core processor family. What is interesting about   these chips is that they represent a third wave of products   manufactured in the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing   technology, which was first used to build the company's   fifth-generation Core processors.What allowed Intel to build better products, though, was that   this wasn't thesame14-nanometer manufacturing technology that was used to build the   fifth- and sixth-generation Core processors; it is a   performance-enhanced version known as 14-nanometer+.At the recent J.P. Morgan Annual Tech Forum, Intel Client   Computing Group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy talked about the   company's strategy in regard to chip manufacturing technology --   at least as it applies to his business unit.There were some interesting bits of information here that I'd   like to go over.Following the 14-nanometer playbook at     10-nanometerThe analyst speaking with Shenoy asked the latter if the   company had plans to do multiple iterations of its 10-nanometer   manufacturing technology -- i.e., 10-nanometer and 10-nanometer+   -- as it did with its 14-nanometer technology.Now, of course, Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr revealed back in   August that the company indeed has three variants of its   10-nanometer technology planned -- 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+,   and 10-nanometer++ -- but Shenoy provided some additional   business context around these plans in his answer.Image source: Intel.""I think we're going to continually look at that,"" Shenoy   said. ""There's one thing that we learned in the process of   getting 14-nanometer out is there is opportunity for us to   continue to optimize the [manufacturing] process, maybe more so   than we had historically.""He then went on to say that such a strategy makes sense   because ""the most important thing is that we can deliver a   predictable, annual cadence of new products.""Shenoy further went on to explain that to deliver an annual   cadence of competitive products, with an emphasis on the word   ""competitive"" -- a company ""can't just sit on the [manufacturing]   process as it existed"" and that the company needs to ""continue to   advance"" the manufacturing processes that it uses to build its   products.""If we can make optimizations on density or optimizations on   performance or power, you're going to see us do that,"" Shenoy   explained.Boasting superiority at 10-nanometersAfter explaining this strategy, Shenoy went on to say that the   company is ""very confident"" that the company's manufacturing   technology ""continues to be the best in the world.""Shenoy then went on to argue that the 10-nanometer   technologies that its competitorsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have recently put into production are ""pretty   close to what we had on [Intel's] 14-nanometer which [Intel] has   been in production on for two years now.""The executive didn't stop there, going on to say that he is   confident that Intel's 10-nanometer technology comes out, Intel   will have a ""clear density advantage, and a clear performance and   power advantage versus what others in the industry have.""One more thing...It's worth pointing out that based on Shenoy's commentary, it   looks increasingly likely that Intel's fourth wave of   14-nanometer products -- recently revealed to be called Coffee   Lake -- will use a yet-again enhanced version of the company's   14-nanometer technology.Indeed, he made it quite clear that to build compelling new   products, the company needs to make enhancements to the   manufacturing technology to support its annual product   rollouts.With 14-nanometer+, the company managed to get a 12%   performance boost. It'll be interesting to see if the company can   wring out another double-digit performance gain with the next   iteration of its 14-nanometer technology.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Getting to the number two   spot means knocking down either Apple orSamsung Electronic(SSNLF).According to IDC, the Chinese company shipped about 33.6   million smartphones around the world in the third calendar   quarter, while Apple shipped 45.5 million and Samsung shipped   more than  72.5 million. The Chinese company will now   infiltrate Apple's biggest market, the U.S., notes CNBC.Yu said at at CES in Las Vegas, ""We never hide our ambition.   We have a vision to make the world's best smartphone.""Yu took a jab at Apple many times during his speech. He even   noted that the more affordable Mate 9 is thinner than the iPhone   7, charges faster and has a longer battery life. In addition, Yu   said Huawei made the first phone to sport a dual-lens camera likethe iPhone 7 Plus.The Mate 9 promotional video said, ""Genius' is no longer in   the domain of a chosen few.""The ad also showed a picture of a light bulb, another indirect   hit at Apple, which is popular for its Genius Bar and has   introduced an ad recently featuring bursting light bulbs, notesCNBC.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksHuawie's Mate 9 has received assistance from other Apple   rivals as well, with the integration of Alexa, Amazon's   artificial intelligent assistant, and DayDream, Google's virtual   reality platform, notes CNBC.Apple Plans Its First Retail Store in South KoreaApple also continues its land grab efforts in the smartphone   market.

Why All the Macro Gurus Are Betting on Emerging Markets;1/8/2017;"I frequently go over recent Guru trades to see what some of the savviest investors on the planet are buying. Usually, there is an idea or two I want to check out more carefully. Worst case scenario, there's a lot to learn from how these men and women think, best case scenario, you find an idea that fits very well with your style.This time I couldn't help but noticePaul Tudor Jones(Trades,Portfolio),George Soros(Trades, Portfolio), Louis Moore Bacon, Stanley Druckenmiller, Charles Brandes (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) all are buying the iShares MSCI Emerging Index. Five out of six are the most prolific macro traders you can find, but Brandes, who's more of a traditional value guy, is somewhat of a surprise.What are they betting on here?makeArticleAd();MSCI Emerging Markets grants exposure to 23 emerging markets.

Without a severe crash, China has been fighting headwinds for several years. Many other emerging markets are suffering because of lowoil pricesas countries like Russia and Brazil are greatly dependent on black gold to fill their coffers.As per Morningstar:The average difference in trailing 12-month P/E ratios for the MSCI World Index relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was 2.7, showing that emerging markets tend to trade at a lower valuation than developed markets. At the end of August 2016, the difference was 5.0, indicating emerging-markets valuations relative to developed markets are currently lower than their trailing 10-year average.Currently, the iShares MSCI Emerging Market ETF trades at a level that corresponds to an average Price/Forward Earnings ratio of 11.57x, while the MSCI World Index sports a 17.2x average ratio. A difference of 5.36x or in other words the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF trades at a discount of 33% to the MSCI World Index. The S&P 500 trades at a 18.5x multiple even.With the valuation gap quite a bit above historical averages, it looks like they are betting on a reversal to the mean here. Not a bad idea as there isn't a real good reason why the MSCI World should trade at such a sizeable premium. Over the long term, the market is a weighing machine and a dollar earned weighs the same, no matter where you weigh it.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with SSNLF.

Apple Inc. Earnings: Mark Your Calendar;1/6/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will announce the results for its important   holiday quarter on Jan. 31, according to an updated schedule on   the company's website. Investors will undoubtedly be watching the   update closely. Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2017, ending Dec.   31, marked the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus   availability. Will the new iPhone help Apple return to revenue   growth?Ahead of the earnings release, here's an early look at some of   the key metrics worth looking into.makeArticleAd();iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.RevenueApple's fiscal 2016 marked a rare year-over-year decline in   revenue for the company. Sales during the fiscal year were about   $217 billion, down about 8% from Apple's record $234 billion in   revenue during fiscal 2015. The company's inability to grow its   top line has suppressed the stock's valuation as investors wonder   if Apple can grow from here.Apple stockcurrently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14 -- wildly low   for an established market leader as dominant as Apple.Still, some investors may be hoping Apple can either turn   revenue around during fiscal 2017 -- or at least put a stop to   top-line declines. Investor hope for a return to growth is   actually encouraged by Apple management; the company guided for   fiscal 2017 first-quarter revenue between $76 and $78 billion,   representing a slight uptick from Apple's $75.9 billion of   revenue in the year-ago quarter.Investors may be hopingSamsung's recall of its Note 7 during the holiday quarter will serve as   a catalyst for Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.   With Samsung's flagship smartphones clearly standing out as the   biggest competition to Apple's iPhones -- especially in the U.S.   -- the Note 7's recall should have helped drive some incremental   iPhone sales during the quarter. And since iPhone accounts for   about 60% of Apple's total revenue, a solid quarter for iPhone   should make a return to growth more likely.Earnings per shareAnother key area to watch will be Apple's earnings per share.   But investors shouldn't expect the metric to return to growth the   way revenue could. Even if revenue turns upward, Apple is   expecting a lower gross profit margin in its first quarter than   it sported in the year-ago quarter; a lower gross profit margin   on only a slight uptick in revenue would likely mean EPS for the   quarter will still be lower than in the year-ago quarter.Apple store. Image source: The Motley Fool.Apple said it's expecting a gross profit margin between 38%   and 38.5% for its first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's   gross profit margin was 40.1%.Importantly, as investors digest the quarter's results,   investors should keep in mind that even if Apple's EPS declines   on a year-over-year basis because of a narrower gross profit   margin, worsening profitability will likely mostly be   attributable tofactors unrelated to Apple's regular   operations. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin benefited   from a $548 million award for patent infringement. Further,   Apple's guidance for a 38% to 38.5% first-quarter gross profit   margin takes into account expectations for 60 to 70 basis points   of currency headwinds.Whatever EPS Apple reports, it would likely be worth   investors' time to look for an explanation from management about   what factors drove EPS higher or lower (probably lower) during   the quarter.For a reference point, the consensus analyst estimates for   Apple's revenue and EPS during the quarter are $77.4 billion and   $3.22, respectively. This would compare to revenue and EPS of   $75.9 billion and $3.28, respectively, in the year-ago   quarter.Apple will release its first-quarter financial results after   market close on Jan. 31. The results will be available on the   tech giant's investor relations website.

Why Micron Technology, Inc. Gained 55% in 2016;1/3/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.What happenedShares ofMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) rose 54.8% in 2016according to data from S&P Global Market   Intelligence. The memory chip price wars of 2015 came to a drastic end, and   Micron's finances took a commensurate turn for the better.makeArticleAd();So whatThe memory chip industry is known for its brutal price wars,   often lasting several years at a time. The end-user demand for   memory products can take wild swings for many reasons, and the   chip producers are not always ready for these shifting market   sands. So Micron and its peers are sometimes left with a huge   imbalance between supply and demand, typically in the direction   of oversupply and plunging unit prices.That was the case in 2015. Micron's operating margins started   that year north of 22%, butSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) flooded the market with cheap DRAM and NAND   memory chips and Micron's operating margins turned negative in   early 2016.Then Samsung reduced its memory production, while chips saw   strong demand thanks to NAND-based solid-state storage devices,   the steady surge of the Internet of Things, and more. Average   selling prices not only firmed up, but started to rise. In the   recently reported first quarter of fiscal year 2017,Micron's adjusted operating margin was a healthy   14%.Share prices followed suit as Micron's financial results   improved.MU Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsNow whatBoth Micron's management and independent memory market   analysts agree that selling prices should remain stable for at   least a couple more quarters. I would go one step further and say   that the era of painful price wars may be largely behind Micron   at this point. The weak hands have been shaken out in the   previous periods of drastic oversupply, leaving just a handful of   memory suppliers with much better control of the day-to-day   supply and demand balance.In 2017, I see Micron shares continuing their recent climb   withanother surgeof as much as another 60%.The downside risk is limited.Long story short, I'm a happy Micron shareholder today whether   I'm looking in the rearview mirror or straight ahead.10 stocks we like better than Micron     TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon and Apple Won the Holiday Season;12/30/2016;"While the fourth quarter has not quite ended and it will take   a while to sort out all the winners and losers of the 2016   holiday shopping season, two clear victors have emerged.Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) said in apress releasethat ""this 2016 holiday was the best-ever season,"" noting that it   shipped more than 1 billion items worldwide with Prime and   Fulfillment by Amazon. The online retailer also reported strong   sales for its Alexa-powered devices Echo and Dot, with sales for   the artificial intelligence (AI) home assistants seeing sales   rise by over nine times compared to last year's holiday   season.The other big winner of the season,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , claimed 44% of all phones and tablets activated   during the season, according to data from Flurry'sAnalytics Blog. That's actually down from 49% last year, but it's still double   the nearest competitor.makeArticleAd();Amazon's Echo and Dot devices were big sellers this year.   Image source: Amazon.Amazon totally crushed itWhile the online retailer rarely shares specific sales numbers   for its devices or membership counts for Prime, it did offer some   information in its post-Christmas press release. The company   called the number of devices purchased from its Echo family of   products ""record setting,"" while also calling its Fire TV Stick   and Fire tablets best-sellers.""Echo and Echo Dot were the best-selling products across   Amazon this year, and we're thrilled that millions of new   customers will be introduced to Alexa as a result,"" said Amazon's   Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. ""Despite our best efforts and   ramped-up production, we still had trouble keeping them in   stock.""Amazon also celebrated (without offering any numbers) its   $99-a-year Prime service, which offers free two-day delivery   along with other perks. The company said that ""more people around   the world tried Prime this holiday season than any previous   year."" It also said that Dec. 23 was the biggest day ever for   Prime Now (its two-hour delivery service available in limited   markets) with the number of items ordered increasing by three   times over last year.A good year for Apple, tooApple does very little discounting during the holiday season   (though it did offer some limited deals on Black Friday). That   did not stop it from seeing iPhones and iPads fly off the   shelves, with the company leading in activations, with 44% of all   devices. That's more than twice the 21%Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) was able to score to come in second, according   to Flurry.Still, while ""Apple devices continue to be the gift to give,""   according to Flurry, Samsung has to be pleased that it not only   held the No. 2 spot, it inched up 1% over last year. That's a   victory given the massive recall of Galaxy Note 7s the company   had to conduct in 2016.These results show that while Apple remains popular, Samsung   had enough goodwill to move past its difficult year. That may be   good news for the Galaxy maker in 2017 when Apple will likely   release a 7s, not a full update to its phone.The gifts that keep on givingBy selling phones and home-based voice assistants in large   numbers, both Amazon and Apple set themselves up for a strong   year. Anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad will likely buy apps,   Apple Music, or other services, putting more money in Apple's   coffers. The same is true for Echo, which allows customers to   subscribe to Amazon's music service and buy items from the online   retailer.In addition, while some people do mix and match, if a person   buys an iPad or iPhone, he or she may purchase other devices in   the Apple family. The same is true for Amazon, as Echo sales   could lead to people buying Fire tablets or Fire TV because they   have become comfortable with the retailer's Alexa voice   assistant. It's possible for both companies that going forward   these sales could lead to consumers using their devices to   automate their homes -- allowing for even more sales   opportunities.10 stocks we like better than Amazon.comWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 5 Best-Selling Wearable Device Brands of 2016;12/29/2016;"Image source: Fitbit.The wearables market isn't growing as analysts originally   anticipated. Last quarter, unit sales across the entire market   grew just 3% year over year, according to IDC. That's quite a   slowdown from the first quarter of the year, when wearable unit   sales increased 67%.makeArticleAd();Part of the slowdown in sales may have been the anticipated   release of theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch Series 2, which delayed some purchases into   the fourth quarter. Smartwatch sales in general lagged in 2016,   as simpler fitness trackers likeFitbit(NYSE: FIT) devices continue to grow.Here are the five best-selling wearable device brands of 2016,   based on data through the first three quarters.FitbitFitbit's brand is synonymous with fitness trackers. Its strong   brand, combined with the company's wide lineup of devices with   varying functionality and price points, allowed it to dominate   the wearable market in 2016. Through the first three quarters of   the year, Fitbit sold 15.8 million wearable devices, according to   data from IDC Research.Fitbit released several new devices in 2016. It launched its   Alta and Blaze lines in the first quarter. Both sold extremely   well through the first three quarters of the year, accounting for   the majority of Fitbit's revenue in the first half of the year.   In the third quarter Fitbit added refreshes of the Charge and   Flex devices to its lineup, bolstering unit sales 11% for the   quarter.Some of Fitbit's biggest opportunities for growth are abroad.   It's growing well in Europe, as CEO James Park points out. ""The   population of the five largest countries -- Germany, France, the   U.K., Italy and Spain -- equals the approximate size of the U.S.,   but less than 15% of our total devices sold today,"" he told   analysts on Fitbit's third-quarter earnings call. Fitbit has   struggled to penetrate the large market in Asia, though.XiaomiXiaomi may be to blame for Fitbit's struggles in Asia. The   Chinese electronics maker released an update to its Mi Band this   year to include a heart-rate sensor and a few other upgrades, and   it's managed to keep the price point below $20 (in U.S. dollars)   in its home country. For reference, Fitbit's average selling   price was $93 last quarter.Xiaomi's dominance is mostly confined to China, where it also   holds a substantial share of the smartphone market. Xiaomi is   working to extend its brand throughout Asia, particularly in   large emerging markets like India. The company should continue to   dominate the low-end wearable device category in the region, as   it uses inexpensive wearables to improve its brand   recognition.GarminGarmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) offers a range of wearable devices catered toward   specific sports like golf, swimming, and cycling. It also offers   generic fitness trackers like many of Fitbit's or Xiaomi's, as   well as high-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch.Garmin's high-end ""fenix"" line of smartwatches boosted sales   of its wearables this year. Smartwatches accounted for nearly   half of Garmin's wearable sales last quarter, offsetting declines   in unit shipments for its more basic wearables.Garmin is also expanding developer support for its Connect IQ   app store. Its high-end devices, like Apple's, benefit from the   additional functionality offered by third-party support. As   Garmin expands its number of smartwatch designs and the number of   apps in Connect IQ, smartwatches should continue to grow as a   share of the company's wearable sales.AppleIt took over a year for Apple to refresh the Apple Watch, and   that ultimately cost it in sales. Sales declined 57% in the   second quarter and 71% in the third quarter, after lapping the   April 2015 launch of the original Apple Watch. The release of the   Apple Watch Series 2 at the end of September was unable to save   third-quarter sales; the smartwatch leader sold 1.1 million units   in the third quarter, according to IDC.CEO Tim Cook responded to IDC's report by telling Reuters,   ""We're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch."" While   he didn't provide any exact sales figures, he said, ""During the   first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch   was greater than any week in the product's history.""   (Sell-through is a measure of how many units actually reach   consumers, instead of just store shelves.)If Apple does indeed have its best quarter ever of Apple Watch   sales, it will (based on IDC estimates) sell over 4.1 million   units.SamsungSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) managed to grab the fifth-place position in   2016. Its Gear S2 smartwatch differentiates itself with built-in   cellular connectivity, so it doesn't need to be connected to a   smartphone to access internet-enabled apps.Samsung also benefited from bundling its newest Gear Fit model   with its line of smartphones, including the Galaxy Note 7.   Despite the recall of the Note 7, customers were able to keep   their discounted smartwatches, which inflated unit sales   somewhat.Low-end devices like the Gear Fit, which compete with Fitbit   devices, accounted for all of Samsung's unit growth in the third   quarter.Early daysSmartwatches have fallen out of favor recently as basic   wearables pick up the slack. IDC expects the market to more than   double by 2020, and smartwatches could play a major role in that   growth.Two main factors will impact the growth of smartwatches over   lower-end fitness bands. First, the introduction of cellular   connectivity in more devices will make them more useful as   independent devices. Second, the growth of third-party developer   support will produce functionality that exceeds simpler fitness   bands.All five companies listed here are poised to take advantage of   further growth in smartwatches if and when they take off, but   Apple lacks a low-end fitness band to protect against a lack of   consumer interest in that market segment.10 stocks we like better than FitbitWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Worth a Buy in 2017?;12/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) has given its investors reasons to be happy in 2016, after a torrid 2015 that saw Micron stock lose by over 59%. Year-to-date, 2016 MU stock has gained 63% and everything looks set for Micron's bullish run to extend well into 2017.Source:Mike Deal via FlickrThe optimism, so to say, comes from MU's impressive results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017.makeArticleAd();For the quarter ended Dec. 1, Micron stock reported earnings of 32 cents per share - excluding items described by MU - three cents better than the earnings-per-share of the first quarter of the prior year. It's also a huge change in direction from the 1 cent per share loss it reported in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2016.Revenue for the quarter clocked in at $3.97 billion, a 19% improvement on a year-over-year basis and a 23% improvement sequentially. Things become more pretty for Micron stock, considering that analysts were expecting earnings excluding items of 28 cents a share on a revenue of $3.98 billion.More impressively, MU expects to earn between 58 cents and 68 cents on revenue ranging between $4.35 billion and $4.7 billion in its second fiscal quarter of 2017. By comparison, Wall Street folks are expecting 39 cents a share on a revenue of $3.91 billion for the second quarter. But is MU stock a buy in 2017? Here are the positives and the negatives.The Good News for Micron StockThe impressive first fiscal quarter of 2017 is mainly down to a favorable demand and supply dynamics. CEO Mark Durcan said supply is declining while demand is rising in a number of its important segments. He said theaverage selling prices for PC DRAM have gone up between 50% and 60%in comparison to trough pricing, following about 18 months of price decline. This was driven by oversupply of DRAM chips, which saw consecutive quarters of revenue decline during its fiscal 2016.10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for     2017Durcan also said that its NAND business is seeing ""like-for-like"" pricing improvement. Micron stock is working on benefiting more from the pricing improvement here by shifting its ""product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower [average selling prices] ASPs""Apart from the fact that this move would likely improve segment profitability, it's also going to help MU stock deal with bigger competitors. Micron owns only the fourth largest share of the NAND market, behindSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),Toshiba(OTCMKTS:TOSBF)andWestern Digital Corp(NASDAQ:WDC). Samsung for instance, can afford to drive down costs and make up for the lower margins in its other businesses if need be. So being able to lower costs will help MU stock cope with competitive pressures.The Bad News for Micron StockWhile the company's expansion moves would help MU stock compete, I still believe that competition remains its biggest threat. The reason it's so much exposed to competition is that it doesn't control the largest portion of any of its key markets - not even second largest. The leaders can decide to flood the market to drive down prices in the future to win more business and hurt smaller players like MU stock. This is similar to what happened recently when the company was reporting declining revenue.Micron stock is also exposed to the unstable PC market. In its first fiscal quarter, PC DRAM accounted for around $605.4 million of its revenue. That's about 15% of its revenue. As PC sales continue to decline - and they havedeclinedfor eight consecutive quarters - its PC DRAM business is going to suffer. Although, it should also be said that its mobile DRAM business has been contributing more to its revenue.Bottom line on MU StockWhile the demand and supply outlook of the semiconductor market is favorable for Micron stock in the near-term, concerns remain as to whether it can deal with future oversupply.Still, MU stock looks better than some of its competitors with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 11. This is cheaper compared toIntelCorporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) forward P/E of 13.Although that is quite attractive, it hinges on assumptions that it will deliver impressive earnings. If you're confident in Micron's future earnings, there could be a bargain here in 2017. Otherwise, I'd stay off MU stock.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017The postIs Micron Technology, Inc.

Nokia essentially admitted   defeat and focused mostly on selling telecom-network   equipment.Not surprisingly, network equipment sales haven't come close   to replacing the lost revenue from Nokia's once-booming cell   phone business. In 2008, Nokia did $74 billion in sales, with a   per-share profit of $1.57.The company's sales have declined every year since, falling to   a measly $13.6 billion in 2015; and earnings are just a fraction   of what they were a decade ago.Perhaps the Nokia P will change that. Even before its new   smartphone hits the market, Nokia's sales have already bounced   back this year, and are on track for a 72% increase. Who knows   how the Nokia P will fare in an extremely crowded smartphone   market, though the low price could sway some consumers. At the   very least, it puts Nokia back on the map after years in the   wilderness.And that's why investors are suddenly snatching up NOK stock.   The run-up in the stock in the past month-plus has mostly   coincided with details of the Nokia P trickling out.Bigger picture, it will be interesting to see what other plans   HMD Global has for Nokia. Tablets are the next logical choice,   especially after HMD paid $350 million in licensing fees to   Microsoft for both mobile phone and tablet usage over the next 10   years as part of their deal with Nokia.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Has More Than One       Thorn In Its SideIt could very well fail to reinvigorate the Nokia brand the   same way Microsoft did. For the moment, however, Nokia suddenly   seems full of possibility - something we haven't been able to say   about the once-proud company for a long time.Buy NOK Stock on Nokia P HypePossibility is an alluring quality to investors, and it should   continue to drive NOK stock in advance of the Nokia P launch.   Based on that possibility, it's worth taking out at least a small   position right now.As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 201710 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       2017The postNokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Pinning its Hopes on   the Nokia Pappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is In the “Dead Money” Zone;12/22/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in June 2015, one of the hottest IPOs wasFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), which soared52% on its first day of trading. The company was heralded as the next big thing in the fast-growing wearables market. But off course, the euphoria would eventually turn into a nightmare for investors. During the past year, Fitbit stock has lost a grueling 74% of its value.Source:Via FitbitNow, it's true that the IPO market can be extremely fickle - and there are many examples of turnarounds. However, with Fitbit stock, there are grave fundamental issues. And yes, these could last for the long haul.makeArticleAd();The irony is that the company's management has made plenty of savvy moves, which is why FIT stock had such a strong reception. The company was the early mover in the wearables market, having been founded back in 2007. Fitbit was extremely aggressive with R&D, marketing and distribution, such as with the establishment of a massive retail footprint.Even though the company would have periodic problems, such as with quality control, there was little doubt that it was focused on creating standout products.The Rise and Fall of Fitbit StockAs is always the case with the emergence of a high-growth market, it did not take long for rivals to move in. Part of this came from plenty of startups, which took advantage of the flush venture capital funds.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017But there were also moves from established companies likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). These operators not only leveraged their tremendous financial resources, but also their strong brands and massive customer bases.Yet the company that has had the biggest impact has been the mightyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Even though the Watch is a broad-based device, there are still important health and fitness tracking capabilities. Besides, AAPL has been able to capitalize on its thriving ecosystem of developers, retailers and distribution partners as well seamless connections with other AAPL devices.Unfortunately, FIT has not done a great job in innovating its product line lately - or at least creating devices that gin up lots of excitement. The fact is that the demand for the Charge 2 and Flex 2 have been lackluster. And this has been evident in the latest earnings report, in which FIT announced bleakguidance. Revenues are expected to inch up 2% to 5% on a year-over-year basis to $725 million to $750 million. The Street, on the other hand, was pegging $985 million.Of course, Fitbit stock took another dive on this news.The irony is that the company is no slouch when it comes to plowing money into R&D. The expenditures are at a hefty 15%.Although, even if FIT is able to get back on track, it may not matter much anyway. Let's face it, Fitbit devices seem more of a niche. How many people really need - or want - to track their vitals? And for those that do, is there much need to upgrade on a regular basis?There are already ominous signs that the wearables market is getting to peak levels. Just take a look at an ominous report from IDC, which shows that the growth rate was a mere3.1% in Q3. Keep in mind that it was 67% in Q1!Then there was a report from analysts at Deutsche Bank, whichstated: ""We continue to view Fitbit as a leader in the wearable fitness category, but given consumer demand appears to be waning for wearable devices, we are taking a wait-and-see approach to the name."" In line with this, the investment bank dropped the price target on Fitbit stock from $18 to $9.Oh, and there is also a study fromGartner, which surveyed people in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. One of the conclusions was that 30% of those who had owned a wearable no longer do so. The report also showed that 35% of the respondents said that they believe that a smartphone is all that is needed.As InvestorPlace.com'sAaron Levitt recentlynoted: ""For the most part, those who want these devices already have them.""The Bottom Line On Fitbit StockNow, it's true that there may be an opportunity in the healthcare space for FIT. For example, the company hassigneda deal withMedtronic PLC(NYSE:MDT) for the launch of an app that allows for monitoring of diabetes patients.Then again, FIT will need to fight tough competitive forces. After all, in September AAPL signed a deal withAetna Inc(NYSE:AET) to subside the Watch for healthcare purposes.Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock ISN'T Really     Stuck In A RutWhat's more, the healthcare industry has long sales cycles and tough regulatory requirements. And again, there remain the issues of adoption. How many people will wind up using devices?For the most part, Fitbit is in a really tough spot. The company's products are not catching fire - and it also looks like the overall market is saturated and the competitive forces are intense. It's an environment that makes it incredibly challenging. In fact, it's similar to what other once-great device makers, likeBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) andNokia Corp(ADR)(NYSE:NOK), have faced. Of course, they have remained dead money for quite some time.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

This Deal Is Another Reason to Take Lucid Motors Seriously;12/21/2016;"Silicon Valley electric-car start-up Lucid Motors said it has   entered a ""strategic supply agreement"" with South Korean giantLG Chem(NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) for lithium-ion battery cells for Lucid's   upcoming electric luxury sedan, the Air.The news was something of a surprise, as it follows an   announcement earlier this month of a similar deal between Lucid   and LG Chem's huge rival, the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). But if anything, it's one more reason   investors interested in electric cars should be watching Lucid's   effort closely.makeArticleAd();Lucid Motors hopes to begin production of its first car, the   Air luxury sedan, by the end of 2018. Image source: Lucid   Motors.What Lucid said about the LG Chem dealIn a statement, Lucid said the new agreement ""establishes LG   Chem asone ofthe key suppliers of cells for Lucid's products"" (emphasis   added). The cylindrical battery cells LG Chem will produce for   Lucid use a ""proprietary chemistry"" developed jointly by the two   companies.Lucid's statement directly acknowledged the existing   relationship with Samsung SDI:Lucid has recently announced a separate battery cell supply     agreement with Samsung SDI. Although both supply agreements are     intended for Lucid's first vehicle, there are other possible     applications for these cells. These could include batteries     developed for other companies as part of Lucid's powertrain     supply business, or variants of the sedan with specific     performance requirements. The differing performance attributes     available from the two cell suppliers provide Lucid with     maximum flexibility to select the best cell for each     application.Lucid has very high expectations for the cells that are used     in our batteries, and we are fortunate to have two companies     that are willing and able to work with us to meet our     requirements.So, what's going on here?Two deals with two heavyweight rivalsIn one sense, it's not surprising that Lucid would seek a deal   with LG Chem, which is already an established player in the   still-new market for lithium-ion cells for automotive   applications. Most notably, it supplies the cells (and some other   parts) forGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM)Chevrolet Bolt EV, and it has been aggressively building production capacity and   seeking other clients around the world. (The Bolt's cells use a   different proprietary chemistry owned by GM.)Of course, we could make a similar case for Samsung SDI.   Samsung, which has made lithium-ion cells for consumer   applications for years, ramped up its electric-car efforts when   it acquired an automotive battery-pack business fromMagna Internationalin 2015. That was one of several moves it has made over the last   couple of years in an effort to build a sizable business as atop-tier auto-industry supplier. Samsung SDI now supplies batteries forBMW's""i"" vehicles andFiat Chrysler Automobiles' electric Fiat 500e.Simply put, both Korean companies are established heavyweights   jockeying for position as electric vehicles become more   commonplace. Meanwhile, aside from a few hand-built prototypes,   Lucid has yet to build a single car -- but it has managed to get   deals with both to supply batteries for its future products.How did Lucid do that? And why?The answer to the ""how"" may be found in Lucid's history. The   company now known as Lucid Motors was originally called Atieva,   and it was originally founded in 2007 to develop advanced battery   packs for electric vehicles. In its initial incarnation, Ateiva   reportedly did electric-vehicle design and engineering work for   GM,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andAudi, and it also did some work on battery packs for electric buses   in China.Ateiva's direction changed in 2014 after a big fundraising   round intended to jump-start its development of a line of   electric cars (and its name changed in October). But the company   retains deep expertise in batteries and battery packs for   electric cars -- and possibly, as its statement about the LG Chem   deal hints, for other applications as well. That's probably why   both Samsung SDI and LG Chem were willing to make deals.As for why, Lucid hasn't quite spelled it out. But there are   many Tesla veterans on Lucid's team (including CTO Peter   Rawlinson, who was the chief engineer on Tesla's groundbreaking   Model S). The company often seems determined to out-do its larger   electric-car rival -- or at least to make a point of showing that   it has learned from Tesla's mistakes.In this case, it's worth noting that Tesla has a deep   relationship with one primary battery supplier (Panasonic). Lucid may feel that Tesla's dependency on a single battery   supplier exposes it to some risk that could be hedged by having   strong relationships with two big suppliers.More evidence that Lucid is for realThe deal with LG Chem is another sign that Lucid is a serious   effort worth watching closely. Lucid is planning to break ground   on its new factory in Arizona sometime in the second quarter of   2017, and it's hoping to begin shipping its first model (the Air   sedan) by the end of 2018.Those dates may slip. However, my sense is that Lucid and its   car are for real, and it looks like a couple of very big   suppliers agree.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

How Risky Is Micron Technology, Inc.?;12/21/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.There's no such thing as a risk-free investment. Shareholders   always need to keep an eye on the risks that come with owning   each of their stocks, in case those potential demons turn up in   the real market.makeArticleAd();As a longtime owner ofMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) shares, I'm about to take a fresh look at that   stock's risk factors.You're welcome to come along and look over my shoulder.Price warsMicron's chosen specialty is in designing and manufacturing of   computer memory chips, both of the DRAM temporary-storage variety   and the stable NAND Flash memory type. It's simultaneously a very   mature commodity market and a cutting-edge innovation platform,   and that mixture leads to an extremely cyclical market.The supply-and-demand equation for memory chips is prone to   wild swings.Sometimes the factories can barely keep up with global demand,   and chip prices hold steady for a while. Ideally, tight supply   would result in higher street prices, but rising chip prices are   as rare as hen's teeth. So stability is about the most favorable   pricing environment Micron and its rivals can hope for.Then, two different phenomena take turns to drive chip prices   lower.Manufacturing methods and the fundamental chip technologies     are always driving down manufacturing costs while boosting     production volumes. When these trends overshoot the end-market     chip demand curve, prices come crashing down due to a     production glut.Sometimes market leaderSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) decides to push its memory-production pedal     to the proverbial metal, causing a glut all by itself. Samsung     can afford to do this because its core business is not in     selling the actual memory chips -- it's more about building     smartphones, home appliances, and consumer electronics gadgets     using those chips, and selling those finished products with a     much higher profit margin.In either case, these price wars send memory specialists like   Micron scrambling for pricing controls. As the third-largest   player in this industry, Micron now has a foot on the sectorwide   accelerator -- and on the brake pedal. So when the market is   flooded with cheap chips, Micron andSK Hynixcan pull back on their production schedules to restore some   normalcy a little bit faster.The reason I'm diving into Micron's price control powers is   simple. The presence of that safety net reduces the level of   business risk involved in owning the stock. And of course,   knowing more about how the market operates puts you in a better   position to take action when something unusual is going on.Image source: Micron.The current state of affairs2015 was a terrible year for Micron, as Samsung put its back into memory production and chip prices   fell through the floor. Micron shares plunged 60% lower amid   falling revenues and negative cash flows. Even now, Micron's   trailing free cash flows stand at a negative $2.7 billion.But things changed dramatically in 2016. Samsung has   reportedly shifted its DRAM capital budget over to the newer 3D   NAND market, leaving room for one of those exceedingly rare   chip-price increases in the DRAM field.Meanwhile, the NAND market is seeing exceptional growth on the   demand side of things. Pick a technology buzzword -- Internet of   Things, automotive computing, solid-state storage, and more --   and you'll find NAND memory playing an important role in all of   these macro trends. So demand growth is outstripping the supply   side's gains for once, and revenues are rising rapidly across the   NAND market.Analysts expect both DRAM and NAND prices to stay high over   the next couple of quarters. That's good news for Micron and its   shareholders, and share prices have bounced back to a   market-beating 46% gain year to date.What's next?Micron just closed the$4 billion buyoutof DRAM technology researcher Inotera. This deal should expand   Micron's DRAM profit margins and add new revenue streams as   sector rivals pay good money to license Inotera's groundbreaking   chip-design technologies.For a fresh update on Inotera's business impact, current   pricing trends, and much more, tune in to Micron's earnings   report on Wednesday evening. Management expects to deliver   roughly $3.7 billion in top-line revenue and about $0.17 per   share in adjusted earnings per share. Analysts have set their   targets significantly higher on both counts, aiming for earnings   of $0.28 per share on sales near $4 billion.Even at these elevated earnings expectations, Micron shares   are trading at just 9.9 times forward earnings today. Both the   company and the stock have plenty of room for further growth. The   downside risk is also significant, but is limited by Micron's   pricing power and solid balance sheet.Long story short, I'm perfectly comfortable holding on to my   Micron shares in this market environment. The likely rewards over   the next couple of years easily outweigh the risks of ownership   here.10 stocks we like better than Micron     TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

BlackBerry Q3 Preview: Smartphone Licensing, New Businesses In Focus;12/19/2016;"BlackBerry (BBRY) is scheduled to publish its Q3 FY'17 earnings on December 20, reporting on a quarter that saw the firm further scale down its smartphone business, while pushing new deals in the software and services space. Below, we outline some of the key trends we will be watching when BlackBerry publishes earnings Tuesday.Trefis has a$8 price estimate for BlackBerry, which is roughly in line with the current market price.See our complete analysis for BlackBerry     heremakeArticleAd();Expect EMM To Drive Software Revenue As Other   Businesses Find Their FootingBlackBerry's software unit has been expanding, driven largely by better monetization of its enterprise mobility management offerings such as BES 12 and Good, which it acquired last year. During Q2 FY'17, Non-GAAP software and services revenues grew by about 111% year-over-year to $156 million. The business is now largely subscription-based, with about 81% of BlackBerry's software revenues during Q2 estimated to be recurring. The stable, annuity-like revenues from the EMM business allow BlackBerry some flexibility to focus on other growth areas such as the Internet of Things and connected car technology.During Q2, BlackBerry signed a deal with Ford to provide software - including its QNX operating system, its Certicom security technology, and audio processing technology - for the automotive giant's connected cars. The deal, which makes BlackBerry a Tier-1 supplier to Ford, could set the stage for further deals in the automotive space. BlackBerry's fleet management system - called Radar - also had its commercial launch during the last quarter. While these emerging business cater to fast growing markets, there are many well-established companies that have beefed up their presence as well. For instance, Samsung is betting big on connected cars, buying Harman for about $8 billion, while Verizon acquired Fleetmatics a major fleet management company, for about $2.4 billion. We will be looking for updates on how BlackBerry's new businesses are faring.Hardware Revenues Will Decline As BlackBerry Intends   To Exit Smartphone BusinessDuring the last quarter, BlackBerry announced that it planned to end all internal smartphone development, in a long-overdue move that is expected to be implemented by the end of this fiscal year. Going forward, the company will license its brand to third parties, who will manufacture and distribute BlackBerry-branded handsets. BlackBerry will also take care of the software and application side of the devices, including its security-focused version of Android. To begin with, BlackBerry has inked a licensing deal with Indonesia's BB Merah Putih, and the company notes that is also working on similar deals in markets such as India and China. While the company has not provided much color on the financial aspects of such agreements, they should help BlackBerry improve its overall profitability by cutting costs relating to handset development as well as capital expenditures and inventory carrying costs. (related:BlackBerry Does The Right Thing By Pulling The Plug On Handset Development)  We will be interested to hear of any updates on any handset-focused licensing deals.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap| U.S. Mid & Small Cap| European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis         Research"

Ignore Micron Technology, Inc.: Here Are 2 Better Stocks;12/17/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Looking atMicron Technology's(NASDAQ: MU) chart this year, it's hard to imagine anything   could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron's stock   has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing theNasdaq's 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble   sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term   pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron   ought to consider:makeArticleAd();MUdata byYCharts.While more diversified semiconductor producers likeIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq,   Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also   proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust   tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a   long-term investor's perspective. So here are two other   semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu   of Micron.1. IntelThough they share a common industry, Intel's and Micron's   respective places within the semiconductor market give them   little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and   server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the ""brains"" for   PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel's   ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it   to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel's cushy   margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in   research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus   extending its chips' competitive position. This self-reinforcing   cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate   competitive advantage over rivals likeAdvanced Micro Devices.The difference in quality between Intel's and Micron's   segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when   you compare their respective margin structures.For example, Intel's two core operating segments are each   larger, more profitable, and more stable than Micron'sentirerevenue base, which relies almost exclusively on commodity-like   memory chips. Moreover, Micron, which recently released its   full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales   this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016   report until early next year, Intel's 2015 operating profits   topped $14 billion, more than Micron's entire sales this fiscal   year. For this article's purposes, Intel's chief virtue is its   lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business.2. SamsungUnlike Intel, Korean conglomerateSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the   memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds   an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a   single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely   complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's   phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory   chips in order to store the code on which their software runs.   Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business,   allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory   suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs.   Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the   company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to   more effectively produce its electronics.Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest   memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but   also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially   in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest   provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that   vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year   2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's   more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to   more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone   operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel)   over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip   market, not its strong competitive stance within it.Foolish bottom lineEach of the companies presented here was selected because it   faces less exposure to the memory-chip business than Micron. As   evidenced by Micron's performance this year, investorscanprofit immensely by investing in Micron under the right   conditions. As in any commodity-esque business, though, times of   weak pricing can cause wrenching losses for companies like   Micron, which relies on memory-chip sales as its sole source of   revenue.To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market   share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout   the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors,   plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less   risk and more growth than Micron does today.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Takes on Amazon With Cortana Speaker;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsQuick: Which tech company would be your pick to pile on the connected home speaker bandwagon? With the surprise success of the Alexa-poweredAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) joined the fray with Google Home. The spotlight was then onApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) unexpectedly beat Apple to the punch last week by announcing Cortana on third party hardware.Source: MicrosoftAnd the company is already showing off an Amazon Echo competitor, with a video clip of the first Microsoft Cortana speaker, coming in 2017.makeArticleAd();Adding another unexpected twist to this plot, the first Microsoft Cortana speaker is beingdesigned by Harman Kardon. Ifthatname rings a bell, it should. Harman Kardon is a premium audio brand that's part ofHarman International Industries(NASDAQ:HAR). And that company was in the news last month becauseit's being purchased for $8 billionbySamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).Microsoft Cortana SpeakerThe Amazon Echo has been successful at establishing a prominent spot in the home for AMZN, and made it the hub of many smart homes. This despite the fact that Amazon lacks a smartphone and doesn't really make any smart devices (other than perhaps the Fire TV). Seemingly out of nowhere, hundreds of third-party smart devices and services now feature Alexa integration because of the Amazon Echo.Like Amazon, Microsoft has also largely been left behind on the smart home front. Connected devices tend to come with smartphone apps that support Apple's iOS or Google's Android. Some are beginning to offer Siri integration and of course a growing number support Alexa - via the Amazon Echo.Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Best High-Tech Gifts     Under $500Outside of the Xbox, MSFT has a minor footprint in the smart home. But a Microsoft Cortana speaker uses the same approach Amazon took.It doesn't matter if no one's carrying a Windows smartphone if you can get them to buy a speaker that establishes Cortana as their home's intelligent assistant. Like the Echo, a Microsoft Cortana speaker is then in position to become the de facto smart home's hub. And it will drive more traffic to Bing - Microsoft's Google search competitor.Partnering with Harman Kardon is a smart move on Microsoft's part. Instead of shouting ""me too"" along with the Echo and Google Home, MSFT can position its smart speaker as a premium audio solution. The Microsoft Cortana speaker wouldn't just be an alternative - it would be anupgradefor Echo early adopters.Once Again, Apple Seems Caught Off GuardApple has spent much of 2016 looking as though it's taking a breather.New product releases like the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 have had the appearance of being iterative upgrades while the company works on true next-generation devices. With the new MacBook Pro, there has been a sense it largely ignored its core user base by introducing a flashy OLED Touch Bar and eliminating legacy ports in the name of getting thinner.And with video streaming becoming a bigger and more competitive business,Apple seems to have fumbled. It was a pioneer in the living room with iTunes streaming and the Apple TV. But as competing hardware gets cheaper and gains 4K support, Apple still charges a significant premium for Apple TV streamers and neither its hardware or iTunes offer 4K support.With Amazon selling so many Echo speakers and Alexa threatening to usurp iPhone-based Siri in smart home integration, the expectation has been that Apple would release its own smart speaker. The fact that the company owns a premium audio company that manufactures best-selling Bluetooth speakers - Beats Electronics - makes the move even more of a no-brainer.Holiday Gift Guide 2016: High-Tech Gift Ideas     When the Sky's the LimitBut there's been silence from Cupertino. It's almost like Apple never saw this coming.With Samsung's peripheral involvement through its pending ownership of Harman Kardon, the Microsoft Cortana speaker means that all the big consumer technology companies are now in the game. Except Apple.If Apple doesn't move soon, the competition is going to be firmly established. Eventually trying to muscle its way into the smart home - convincing people to ditch their Echo or Microsoft Cortana speaker for a Beats/Siri version - is going to be similar to Amazon trying to get people to dump their iPhones for aFire Phone.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHoliday Gift Guide 2016: The Best Smartwatch     and Fitness TrackersHoliday Gift Guide 2016: The Best iPhone 7     CasesHoliday Gift Guide 2016: 5 Bluetooth Headphones     for iPhone 7 OwnersThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Takes on Amazon With Cortana Speakerappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Things HP Inc Management Wants You to Know;12/16/2016;"Shareholders ofHP(NYSE: HPQ) are likely feeling pretty good about its performance   since becoming independent a little over a year ago. As of Dec.   13, HP stock has climbed an impressive 34% year to date. On the   other hand, analysts have fairly muted expectations and investor   concerns about the PC and printing markets has left HP woefully   undervalued relative to its peers.With its consensus average price target of a mere $16.10 a   share and what amounts to a ""hold"" rating, it's clear most   pundits aren't expecting much from HP in the coming year. But   there are a few things HP management wants investors to know that   warrant a more bullish sentiment, particularly from folks in   search of growth and income.makeArticleAd();Image source: HP, Inc.Leader of the packNot surprisingly, global PC sales eased again in the third   quarter, by 5.7%. The drop in PC sales marked the eighth straight   quarter of negative results, an all-time record for the market.   That can't be good for HP, right? Turns out, the answer to that   question is a resounding, ""Yes.""Despite significant declines by most global PC manufacturers   last quarter, HP was one of the few that actually grew sales year   over year, inching ever closer to China-basedLenovo(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) in the race to become the global leader. A   year ago HP commanded 18.8% of worldwide PC sales compared to   Lenovo's 20.2%.This year, HP has upped its PC game by targeting specific,   niche markets such as its virtual reality (VR) ready, high   resolution OMEN laptop for gamers. That strategy is a big part of   the reason HP now has a 20.4% market share, while Lenovo's piece   of the global PC pie is just 20.9%. Don't be surprised if HP   takes over the top spot after this year's holiday shopping season   comes to an end.The writing on the wallAt least part of the aforementioned tepid expectations from   analysts is likely due to HP's printing unit results. But there   are a couple of things HP management wants investors to know   before dismissing its print division.Last quarter HP reported an 8% drop in total print revenue to   $4.56 billion, led by a 12% decline in supplies sales. The thing   is, in HP's fiscal 2016 third quarter, announced in August,   printing sales had slid a combined 14%, with supply revenue   sagging 18% compared to a year ago. CEO Dion Weisler's PC   strategy of targeting specific market segments is also working   within its printing division. A couple pending opportunities will   help HP keep its positive printing momentum going.The pending $1.05 billion acquisition ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print division will give HP a boost in a   number of ways. In addition to its multifunction copier   technologies, the deal with Samsung also includes ""more than   6,500 printing patents"" and over 1,200 engineers and   researchers.And Samsung's supplies business should help HP's most   struggling segment of its printing division. Finally, there's the   not-so-small matter of the budding 3D printing market, or as HP   refers to it, the ""fourth industrial revolution."" With two   new-ish 3D printers now ready for the world's manufacturers, HP   is expected to be one of the market leaders, if not the market   leader. And with a price tag starting at $130,000, it won't take   too many 3D printer sales to move the needle.One more thingIn addition to potential growth well beyond the most   analysts's expectations, HP offers shareholders one of the best   dividend yields in tech. With a strong balance sheet that   includes $6.29 billion in cash and equivalents, HP's   approximately 3.4% dividend yield isn't in jeopardy of being   lowered or discarded anytime soon.In today's low interest rate environment, a dividend yield   over 3% is outstanding. Now toss in the fact that HP stock is   trading at just a touch over nine times future earnings, and it   offers growth and income investors a compelling alternative.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Risks Qualcomm Will Face After Acquiring NXP Semiconductors;12/16/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) seems to have opened the door to automotive riches   with its pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . NXPcurrently holds14.5% share in the automotive semiconductor market, which is   expected to be worth $36 billion by 2019, and Qualcomm is buying   the lead in this fast-growing market with its pending $47 billion   purchase of NXP.However, Qualcomm's NXP acquisition does not ensure that the   former will become the dominant player in the automotive   semiconductor business, as it will face a stiff challenge fromInfineon Technologies(NASDAQOTH: IFNNY) . Additionally, Qualcomm might face   integration and margin challenges once the merger is   complete.makeArticleAd();Why Infineon could pose a strong challengeInfineon Technologies is the second-largest supplier of chips   to the automotive industry with an estimated market share of   10.4% to NXP's 14.5%. This means that Infineon does not lag NXP   by a huge margin. What's more, in 2015, Infineon led NXP in two   of the three subsegments in the automotive semiconductor   market.Image source: Infineon Technologies.Infineon led NXP in the market for power and sensor chips in   the automotive industry last year. These two markets were worth   $11.3 billion. In comparison, NXP led Infineon by a huge margin   in the microcontroller segment, which was alone worth $6.5   billion.In the long run, Infineon can close the gap on NXP as it is   the leading supplier of drivetrain solutions to electric   vehicles. Infineon supplied its drivetrain solutions to seven of   the top 10 electric vehicles in terms of sales last year. It   counts the likes ofTesla Motors,BMW, Chevrolet,Volkswagen, and BYD Tang as its customers. This puts Infineon in a strong   position in this market as it projects that sales of electric   vehicles will grow from just 400,000 units in 2015 to 10 million   units in 2025.Along with pending growth in the number of electric vehicles   -- which accounted for less than 1% of market share in 2015 --   the amount of semiconductor content is also expected to grow.   Infineon forecasts that the semiconductor bill of materials in an   EV will be as much as $705 per vehicle by 2025. In comparison,   the chip content in each vehicle last year was $332, according to   NXP.EVs will carry higher chip content as compared to   internal-combustion-engine-based vehicles becausethe electric drivetrain used in EVs contains a lot of electronics   for power switching. The electronic systems in a hybrid   drivetrain route power from the battery to the motor through an   inverter, while no such electronic systems are needed in an   internal-combustion engine.According to McKinsey, the average hybrid drivetrain contains   10 times the semiconductor content as compared to an   internal-combustion drivetrain. As a result, the demand for   insulated-gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, will continue   increasing as they play an important role in EV power   systems.Infineon enjoys a strong position in the IGBT market with a   market share of 27.6%. In 2015, the IGBT market was worth $3.94   billion, according to Infineon, and some estimates put it at $6   billion in revenue by 2018.So, Infineon could bridge the market share gap over NXP in the   long run on the back of EV growth.Integration challengesQualcomm's acquisition of NXP will have a negative margin   impact on the former. This is because Qualcomm's gross margin   profile is higher than that of NXP. For example, in the recently   reported third quarter, NXP posted a non-GAAP gross margin of   50.5%. In comparison, Qualcomm's gross profit margin in the third   quarter stood at 58% .Thus, as Qualcomm begins to integrate NXP after the merger is   complete in 2017, the gross margin might start deteriorating. The   higher gross margin profile of Qualcomm is a result of its   fabless manufacturing model as it outsources its chip   manufacturing to foundries such asSamsung.On the other hand, NXP has a foundry-based business model. It   has 14 chip manufacturing facilities, along with seven packaging   and testing facilities. However, these facilities can't   manufacture chips for Qualcomm as they are ""outdated,"" according   toMarket Realist. This reduces one potential synergy from the acquisition.Despite this hiccup, the NXP acquisition is expected to   deliver $500 million in annual cost synergies for Qualcomm within   two years after the closure of the transaction. However, 65% of   the savings will be on the operating expense side as Qualcomm   will be able to use NXP's existing relationships to sell its   automotive and Internet of Things products.Qualcomm will also reduce its cost of goods sold as the   combined companies can negotiate for lower raw material prices   from suppliers. The reduction in the cost of goods sold will   account for 35% of the cost-saving synergy from the acquisition.   The reason the cost of goods sold synergies will be significantly   lower than the operating expense reduction is because Qualcomm   will not make much gains on the manufacturing side of the   business due to the difference in the foundry business.Also, given the legacy nature of the foundries, it is likely   that NXP won't be getting Qualcomm's money to upgrade them. This   is because Qualcomm has a different business model of outsourcing   its manufacturing, and investing in NXP's foundries would lead to   an increase in costs.Although NXP will definitely add another dimension to   Qualcomm's business, we've seen that it will also have a negative   gross margin impact and pose integration issues. Additionally,   the threat from Infineon cannot be ignored.So even though Qualcomm is making a smart move by acquiring   NXP Semiconductors, it is not guaranteed a smooth journey toward   automotive riches.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Electric-Car Fans Should Watch Lucid Motors Closely;12/15/2016;"Electric-car start-up Lucid Motors unveiled its first product   in a media event in California on Wednesday. Lucid's Air is a   sleek high-performance sedan that will have specifications and   pricing calibrated to compete directly withTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .This is significant, and investors interested in electric and   self-driving cars should sit up and take note. The Lucid Air is   no flight of designer fancy. It's a serious product, and Lucid is   a serious company that stands an excellent chance of succeeding.   Read on.makeArticleAd();The Lucid Air is an electric luxury sports sedan that promises   long range, thrilling performance, and advanced self-driving   capabilities. Image source: Lucid Motors.About the carThe Lucid Air is a big luxury sedan that promises to combine   extreme high performance with a roomy, comfortable, and quiet   interior equipped with a lot of advanced technology.Like the top Tesla models, the Lucid Air should be very fast,   at least in a straight line. It might be even faster: Lucid   claims ""best-in-class energy density"" for the Air's 100   kilowatt-hour battery pack, which it says will give the Air ""in   excess"" of 300 miles of range.Once the Air is in production, a 130 kWh battery pack will be   available as an optional upgrade. That will offer ""up to"" 400   miles of range and ""up to"" 1,000 horsepower. Both figures are a   step ahead of what Tesla's current top-performing models can   deliver right now.Image source: Lucid Motors.Lucid's battery packs will use a new lithium-ion battery cell   developed by the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) that promises ""breakthrough battery life,""   according to Lucid's chief technology officer, Peter   Rawlinson.The Air's motor and transmission unit was developed entirely   in-house, Lucid said. It claims that it's ""smaller, more   efficient and more power-dense than competitors, while   potentially more reliable."" (The word ""potentially"" is doing a   lot of work in that sentence. But as we'll see, Lucid's engineers   are not new to the car business.)Inside, Lucid promises ""executive seating"" with cushy,   reclining rear seats that offer comfort and legroom comparable to   first-class airline seats. A 29-speaker audio system will provide   active noise cancellation to ensure that it's a quiet space.As you'd expect from a Silicon Valley automaker, self-driving   technology will be built in. Lucid will aim to have the Air   equipped with ""Level 4"" self-driving capability at launch,   pending approval by U.S. regulators. ""Level 4"" systems can take   full control of the vehicle under most (but not all) conditions,   with little to no involvement from the human driver.The Lucid Air's back seat is scaled for adult comfort. Image   source: Lucid Motors.Lucid hasn't finalized pricing for the Air. But it said that a   fully loaded ""launch edition"" will be priced around $160,000,   with standard versions starting around $85,000. Lucid hopes to   get the starting price down to around $65,000 in time.If all goes according to plan, production of the Air will   begin in late 2018. But some big things have to happen in order   for that plan to pan out.Is this vaporware, or is it for real?It's for real. This is not vaporware. It could turn out to be   a big deal. But there are some caveats that come with that   statement.For starters, Lucid is a real company, founded in 2007. It has   about 330 employees, many with past experience at Tesla or at   large global automakers. Its chief designer, Derek Jenkins, was   formerly the director of design atMazdaNorth America. And Peter Rawlinson, the chief technology   officer, came to Lucid with one of the greatest electric-car   resume credentials possible: He was chief engineer on the Tesla   Model S.In some ways, the Lucid Air can be thought of as the Model S   2.0. It's averyserious, advanced design that reads in many ways as a redesigned   Model S informed by experience. And it's clearly very close to   production-ready. It's not a show car.The shape of the Air's roof allows plenty of rear-seat   headroom. Image source: Lucid Motors.But that's where the caveats come in: Right now, Lucid doesn't   have a factory in which to build the Air or anything else.It has a site for a factory, in Casa Grande, Arizona, selected   for its proximity to key auto-industry suppliers in Mexico. It   has a package of subsidies promised by the Arizona state   government, and a detailed plan to start constructing the $700   million facility in the second quarter of 2017.But it will need to raise money to make the factory a fully   functional operation. Lucid has said that future fundraising   rounds are planned, but it hasn't yet given specifics.So should we take Lucid Motors seriously?I think we should. Lucid seems to be positioning itself as a   sober-minded (""lucid"") alternative to Tesla, in part by making a   point of being entirely focused on electric automobiles. It   doesn't have a whiz-bang CEO like Elon Musk -- but Lucid (which   employs a lot of Tesla veterans, remember) might argue that   Musk's outsized public image and futuristic visions take   attention away from Tesla's products in the here and now.If anything, Lucid seems quietly determined to learn from (and   not repeat) Tesla's missteps. It won't rush the Air into   production nor let itself get distracted by far-future visions.   That ""lucid"" attitude, the car itself, and the serious cash   already invested in the company make it worth close attention as   its plan unfolds.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

1 Surprising Reason Intel Corporation Wants to Be a Contract Chip Maker;12/15/2016;"Microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is the world's largest chip company by revenue,   and most of that $55 billion-plus in revenue comes from the sale   of chips that the company designs and manufactures itself.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();In contrast, most other chipmakers design their own products   but rely on third-party contract chip manufacturers to   manufacture those designs. Those chipmakers are commonly referred   to as ""fabless"" semiconductor companies. That's because a chip   manufacturing plant is referred to as a ""fab,"" which is short for   ""fabrication plant.""Intel has been working to try to build out a contract chip   manufacturing business with the aim of nabbing business from   market leaderTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) as well asSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .The obvious reason for Intel to want to enter this business is   simply to find a way to make more money. After all, Intel can't   design and build products for every segment of the market, so it   makes sense for Intel to try to capitalize on opportunities by   manufacturing chip designs for others.A not-so-obvious reason -- one that Intel manufacturing   executive Stacy Smith recently talked about -- is that by   configuring itself to be able to handle a wider variety of chip   designs from third parties, Intel can help its internal chip   design teams to be more effective.Let's take a closer look at what Smith had to say at theCredit Suisse20th Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Conference.   Transcript viaSeeking Alpha.Building that foundry capabilitySmith conceded that the company's revenue and unit volumes   from contract chip customers are quite small today. However, he   stressed that having the capability to service those customers   has ""a lot of option value to [Intel] as a company. ... But I   don't want to minimize that the capability to flip it around and   show that foundry face to our internal [system-on-a-chip]   organization is absolutely key,"" Smith said.He added that he and Intel Client and Internet of Things   President Murthy Renduchintala want to make sure that Intel's own   system-on-a-chip teams can ""land a product very quickly and take   advantage of our Moore's Law benefit.""A really important capabilityOne of the big strengths of the contract chip manufacturers is   that their manufacturing processes, design tools, and   intellectual-property libraries are all designed to allow chip   designers to quickly put together a diverse range of   system-on-a-chip products.That makes a lot of sense, given that, historically, those   contract-chip makers have been required to service a lot of   different customers with a wide-ranging set of requirements.   TSMC, for example, builds everything from Wi-Fi chips all the way   to high-performance graphics processors.Intel, on the other hand, has built its business primarily   around high-performance microprocessors targeted at the   personal-computer and server markets designed by in-house   teams.As Intel tries to push into new areas, and as its core markets   require an increasingly diverse set of products, the company   needs to make sure that its internal design teams aren't   hamstrung by the very manufacturing technology that Intel   management cites as a key strength.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

The group claims that the first devices with Bluetooth 5 should start showing up two to six months after it announced the new standard, which was earlier this month.If the Samsung Galaxy S8 does use Bluetooth 5, it will give it a huge advantage over other smartphones released before the new standard was announced. Bluetooth 5 supports a range four times larger than its predecessor, speeds twice as fast and broadcast message capacity that is eight times larger than before, reportsGSMArena.com.There have also been other changes made with Bluetooth 5 that would make it a great benefit for the Samsung Galaxy S8. This includes improving the standard's compatibility with other wireless devices. This should lead to less interference and better communication with Internet of Things devices.The Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is a member of, is expecting great things from the Internet of Things. It currently estimates that48 billion Internet of Things devices will be installed by 2021. It also estimates that one third of these devices will use Bluetooth technology.More From InvestorPlace7 A-Rated Tech Stocks That Power the     IndustryThe 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of     2016The 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy for     2017The postSamsung Galaxy S8 May Be First Phone to Feature Bluetooth 5appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Dolby Laboratories Looks to Atmos to Help Drive Growth;12/14/2016;"It's no mystery thatDolby Laboratories(NYSE: DLB) has struggled to reaccelerate growth in recent years,   given the persistent declines of its legacy consumer-electronics   licensing business.  But by expanding the presence of   newer offerings such as Dolby Atmos, the audio technologist could   be on the cusp of doing just that while simultaneously   reinforcing the cornerstones of its business.Image source: Dolby LaboratoriesmakeArticleAd();That's not to say Dolby Atmos isentirelynew; the cutting-edge audio standard made its debut in 2012,   after all, with the cinematic launch ofDisneyPixar'sBrave.More to comeBut Dolby has only continued to make Atmos more pervasive   since then. Last week, for example, Dolby announced there are now   2,000 Dolby Atmos-enabled cinema screens installed, as well as   more than 500 movies released featuring the surround-sound   technology. For additional perspective, Dolby noted that Atmos   has been deployed in over 60 countries and more than 150   post-production facilities.And Dolby Atmos isn't finished yet. During Dolby's most   recently quarterly conference call in late October, management   told investors that Atmos was already installed or committed in   more than 2,400 cinematic screens, with roughly 550 Atmos movie   titles announced or already released. That means adoption of   Atmos in the cinema is virtually guaranteed to grow at least   another 20% when its current commitments are fulfilled. And   noting that the most widely anticipated movies each year   generally release in more than 4,100 theaters in the U.S.   alone, there's plenty more room for Dolby Atmos to grow its   presence on the big screen after that.A flexible solutionThe real beauty of Atmos is its flexibility. Sure, Dolby Atmos   can support up to 128 discrete audio tracks spread across as many   as 64 unique speaker feeds. At the same time, it can be scaled   down to more modest 5.1 and 7.1 setups for surround sound in home   theater environments, and a handful of the first Dolby Atmos   sound bars hit the market this year from partners includingSamsung,Philips, and Yamaha.Trending further down the consumer line, Dolby Atmos is   featured in a growing number of Blu-ray devices and streaming   services and, according to Dolby CEO Kevin Yeaman, ""is in the   process of being adopted by a number of pay TV operators around   the world."" Further, Dolby Atmos has even found its way into a   number of mobile devices -- where it's best experienced through   headphones -- including smartphones and tablets from the likes of   Lenovo,Amazon.com, and, most recently a new flagship mobile phone from India's   LeEco.Finally, though he didn't offer specifics, Yeaman also teased   during last quarter's call, ""As we enter 2017, we see   opportunities to expand the presence of the Dolby Atmos   experience to a broad base of consumers.""Primed for growthOf course, investors should keep in mind that Atmos is only a   piece of Dolby's larger puzzle. In fact, Dolby revealed last   quarter that revenue from its newest initiatives and patents --   including those for Dolby Vision, Dolby Voice, and Dolby Cinema   (in the last of which Dolby Atmos plays a key role) -- came in   just short of $30 million last year, in line with Dolby's goals   outlined at the start of this fiscal year. And Yeaman believes   these newer revenue streams have room to grow between twofold and   threefold for ""the next couple of years.""Whether that growth will be enough to meaningfully offset the   stubborn declines of Dolby's legacy business remains to be seen.   But at the very least, and thanks in no small part to growing   acceptance of Dolby Atmos, it's clear that Dolby is doing   everything it can to position itself for success going forward.10 stocks we like better than Dolby LaboratoriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Things Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. Management Wants You to Know;12/14/2016;"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) is a contract chip manufacturer that services a very   broad range of customers, spanning virtually all areas of the   semiconductor landscape. It has managed to deliver consistent   revenue and profit growth over the last several years, thanks in   large part to its high exposure to the boom in mobile   computing.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();TSMC hosted a conference call with investors back in   October to discuss its financial results, in addition to a   variety of other topics. In this column, I'd like to go over   three items that really stood out.28-nanometer still going strongAlthough there is a lot of focus on TSMC's leading-edge   technologies like 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, and soon   10-nanometer, a large portion of the company's revenue comes from   older manufacturing technologies.Indeed, although high-end, performance, and power-sensitive   processors tend to be built on the newest technologies available   (i.e., mobile applications processors for premium smartphones),   more cost-sensitive chips (like Wi-Fi chips, low-cost mobile   applications processors, and so on) are built on older   technologies.One such technology is TSMC's 28-nanometer technology, first   introduced back in late 2011. Per the company, 24% of the   company's revenue last quarter came from this technology.   Moreover, TSMC said its capacity on this technology ""remained   fully utilized.""Demand is certainly robust for TSMC's 28-nanometer   technology.TSMC's 7-nanometer tech will get an ""upgrade"" in     2018TSMC's next-generation, leading-edge manufacturing technology,   known as 7-nanometer, is expected to go into mass production in   early 2018. The company says  it will ""complete developing   7-nanometer in 2017"" and then ""upgrade 7-nanometer in 2018.""After the enhanced 7-nanometer technology, TSMC intends to   introduce a next-generation 5-nanometer technology, which it   plans to put into risk production in the first half of 2019   (suggesting volume shipments in the first half of 2020).The company's plans are designed to ""support smartphone and   high-end mobile product[s] on an annual cadence.""TSMC's main peers in chip manufacturing --Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) -- have also indicated that they intend to deliver   performance-enhanced versions of their own next-generation   manufacturing technologies over time, as well.Mobile and high-performance computing products to fuel     growth""We believe mobile will continue to be a growth driver for   TSMC in the next few years,"" TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu said.Liu went on to say that TSMC expects worldwide smartphone unit   shipments to enjoy mid-single-digit growth over the next five   years. He also shared TSMC's expectation that the amount of   silicon content inside of smartphones ""will continue to increase,   driven by increasing smartphone features such as dual camera,   security sensing, [augmented reality], [virtual reality], and   migrating to 4G, 4G Plus, and 5G.""Beyond mobile, though, Liu highlighted growth opportunities in   the world of high-performance computing, particularly in deep   learning (a type of machine learning).""These rapid developments of artificial intelligence   technology allowing machine ability to see, hear, and predict has   huge implications in many industry verticals like healthcare,   media, consumer, automotive, and so forth,"" Liu Said. ""The   silicon content to support [artificial intelligence]   applications, I think will be huge.""10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor     ManufacturingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What Does 2017 Have In Store For Apple's iPhone Business?;12/13/2016;"Apple's (AAPL) fortunes are tied to the iPhone in a big way, with the device contributing over 65% of the company's total revenues and over 75% of its gross profits, per our estimates. However, 2016 turned out to be a difficult year for the flagship device, which saw its first year-over-year decline in sales (down 12.5% to 137 million units for the first 9 months) amid a weaker uptake for the iPhone 6S, headwinds in the Chinese market and some early supply constraints for its latest iPhone 7. However, we believe that things should look up in 2017, as Apple takes advantage of some weakness at rival Samsung Electronics' smartphone unit, while benefiting from the launch of a completely redesigned iPhone later in the year. Below we spell out some of the key factors that are likely to drive the iPhone business in 2017.We have a$125 price estimate for Apple,which is about 10% ahead of the current market price.See Our Complete Analysis For Apple StockmakeArticleAd();Weakness at Samsung and Anniversary iPhone Should Help   Bolster SalesWe believe that the the iPhone 7 - which will remain Apple's flagship offering for at least eight months this year - will see slightly better sales compared to the 6S over its life cycle. While this will be partly due to better features such as superior cameras and water resistance, the device could also win over customers from rival Samsung, which suffered a significant blow to its brand image after a botched double recall and eventual discontinuation its high-end Note 7 smartphone, following a series of fires and overheating incidents. This is a boon for Apple, given that popular Samsung devices such as the S7 Edge were at least partly responsible for the lackluster performance of the iPhone 6S. Moreover, Apple is expected to launch a completely redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone, sporting an edge-to-edge OLED display and other enhancements, in the fall of 2017. We believe that the device should set off a super-upgrade cycle of sorts, since it would mark the first complete iPhone re-design since 2014.Chinese Headwinds Might ContinueMuch of the contraction in iPhone sales during 2016 came from China, and we believe that things could remain challenging in 2017 as well. While this is partly due to a depreciating Yuan (The RMB is down by roughly 5% versus USD over the past year) and a weak macroeconomic environment in China, Apple is also being hurt by competition from Chinese rivals, who have significantly shorter product development cycles and offer feature rich products at lower price points. Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone market slipped from 12.4% in Q3 2015 to about 8.4% in Q3 2016, per Counterpoint research. That said, we expect things to pick up towards the end of the year, as Apple launches refreshed versions of the iPhone.iPhone Margins May Face Some PressureApple's iPhone margins could face some pressure in 2017. The iPhone 7 is reported to be more expensive to build compared to its predecessors, as it sports more advanced components and higher storage capacity (related:Apple's Flagship iPhone Keeps Getting More Expensive To Build). Moreover, pricing power for the iPhone 7 could diminish as the cycle progresses, given its aging design compared to Apple's rivals who have been offering modular devices, bezel-free designs and curved displays. Moreover, the appreciating U.S. dollar could also hurt Apple's margins, as over two-thirds of its revenues come from overseas.  However, there could be two positives factors influencing iPhone margins in 2017. Firstly, the demand mix for the larger 7 Plus models, which command a $120 premium, appears to be stronger compared to previous iterations of iPhone. Secondly, the 10th  anniversary device, which should launch in the fall could be priced at a premium, helping overall margins.The Pixel ThreatAlphabet's (GOOG) subsidiary Google is now directly competing in the smartphone hardware market with the launch of its high-end Pixel handset. The device adopts the proven Apple model of offering well-designed hardware with tightly integrated software and services. Reviews of the device have been overwhelmingly positive, with critics praising its superior Android implementation, AI capabilities and camera. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project that Google could ship 5 to 6 million units of the device next year. While this pales in comparison to the 200 million+ smartphones that Apple sells annually, the Pixel could pose a legitimate threat to Apple over the long run for two reasons. Firstly, Google still has plenty of room to scale up its distribution footprint with wireless carriers, as Verizon is currently its only carrier partner in the U.S. Secondly, the switching costs around Apple's ecosystem are also coming under threat, amid increasing proliferation of third-party cloud-based services which are largely platform-agnostic and enjoy significant network effects.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

The Most Expensive Wearable Fitness Device of 2016;12/13/2016;"Wearables have been getting a lot of attention in the last few   years, and have only grown in popularity among the market and   market analysts in 2016. From basic pedometers to wearables   that are miniature computers, wearable fitness device companies   are increasingly trying to set themselves apart with new ways to   better serve the fitness market.Image source: Getty.What was this year's most expensive wearable fitness device?   To make that determination, I didn't consider medical devices   such as glucose monitors, since neither of those really qualifies   as a ""fitness"" device. I tried to consider only devices that were   truly fitness-oriented, and that could be purchased directly from   the brand without including things such as third-party watch band   options that might increase the price without changing the actual   device.makeArticleAd();With all that in mind, the most expensive wearable fitness   device of 2016 wasApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) new Apple Watch Series 2 Edition, retailing for   a cool $1,299.Image source: Apple.What $1,300 will get you in a smartwatchApple's signature wearable, the original Apple Watch, made a   splash in the industry when it was launched in 2015 as a premium   smartwatch to be paired with a user's iPhone to get alerts, offer   connectivity for third-party apps, and utilize fitness features   such as activity tracking and heart-rate monitoring.The new Series 2 watch, launched in September, is   now waterproof, comes with stand-alone GPS for run tracking   without being connected to your phone, and has other upgrades   such as longer battery life, a brighter screen, faster operating   software, and a louder speaker.Here's a more detailed review, but basically the Apple Watch 2 is not a huge overhaul of the   Apple Watch 1, though the upgrades make it much more suitable for   fitness enthusiasts.If you'd like that watch cased in ceramic, which Apple's site   says is ""engineered to be as strong as it is   beautiful,"" then you'll pay $1,299 for the luxury fitness   device. The Apple Watch 2 starts at $369 for the smaller-sized   ""sport"" version, however. While there certainly seem to be people   willing to pay this hefty price for a fitness device, the data   shows that the real market growth so far seems to be in the   ""basic wearables"" segment, which includes those that don't offer   third-party apps, such asFitbit(NYSE: FIT) .The fitness-device market in 2016 and beyondThe Apple Watch 1 is now available for as low as $269. That's   only slightly higher than Fitbit's most premium model at $250,   but it's substantially more than Fitbit's most popular trackers   for around $100 to $200. The most recent numbers of how well each   company's devices are selling continue to show that the growth is   with the lower-cost basic fitness devices, which control 85% of   the market.The International Data Corporation (IDC) reports on   fitness-device sales worldwide. In the most recent data for the   third quarter through September, Fitbit maintained its leadership   position and grew its market share (by total units shipped) from   21.5% in Q3 2015, to 23% in Q3 2016, thanks to an 11% increase in   units sold. Apple Watch shipments during that time declined by   71% so that Apple's market share dropped from 7% to less than   5%.CompanyGlobal Wearables Market Share (by Units             Sold, As of Q3 2016)Units-Sold Growth (Year Over Year)Fitbit23%11%Xiaomi16.5%4%Garmin5.7%12%Apple4.9%(71%)Samsung4.5%90%Data sources:IDC, as of Q, released on Dec. 5These numbers look weak for Apple, but consider that the Apple   Watch Series 1 has now been out for two years and that Q3 data   includes only a few weeks of the Apple Watch Series 2 on the   market. Therefore, Apple's units sold may grow more in Q4 when   the new watch has been out for a full quarter. The reverse is   true forSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which released two new smartwatches in   Q3 and shipped more units by bundling them with Note 7 and other   Samsung phones.Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's clearly   still a basic-fitness-device market for the time being, and   Fitbit seems to be growing its lead even in the face of cheaper   options such as Xiaomi, with its $15 trackers. For 2017 and   beyond, this looks like a growing opportunity for the companies   in the basic-wearables space to take charge of this growing   market, which IDC expects to grow from about 101 million units   shipped in 2016 to 213 million by 2020. Fitbit has had its share   ofpoor sentiment on Wall Street lately, but these numbers certainly look encouraging now.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Major Apple Inc. Supplier Details New Chip Tech;12/9/2016;"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) scored a major win in 2014 whenApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) began relying exclusively on the chip giant for   the manufacture of its A8 and A8X applications processors. TSMC   suffered a bit of a setback vis-a-vis Apple when it wound up   splitting the A9 chip manufacturing contract withSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , though the company is believed to have   secured all the orders for the A10 chip that powers this year's   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Revenue from Apple represents a significant portion of TSMC's   business, so the chipmaker is likely very motivated to develop   and release compelling new manufacturing technologies at a rapid   clip to keep Apple's business.Apple's upcoming A11 is expected to be manufactured in TSMC's   10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, and the company's   statementsstrongly suggestthat it will be using TSMC's follow-on 7-nanometer technology to   build the A12.TSMC recently detailed that 7-nanometer tech. Let's take a   closer look at it to understand what kinds of performance and   power enhancements Apple can potentially bring to the A12.Honey, I shrunk the chip!TSMC says that its 7-nanometer technology can provide more   than 3.3 times the routed gate density of its prior-generation   16-nanometer technology (used to build Apple's A9, A9X, and A10   chips). This means that functionality that required a chip   area of 100 square millimeters when manufactured in the   16-nanometer technology could be done in just a hair over 30   square millimeters using this new 7-nanometer technology.What Apple has tended to do is keep its chip sizes roughly   flat generation over generation, using the increased density to   cram more functionality and features into a given area.Data source: Wikipedia.Apple was forced to use manufacturing technologies that   offered roughly the same density for three generations (TSMC's   16-nanometer technology didn't offer a significant area reduction   over its 20-nanometer technology; it was primarily a performance   improvement), which led to some die size growth over the last   three years.Since the 7-nanometer technology gives a huge area reduction   over the 16-nanometer technology, Apple can could conceivably   pack in more than three times the ""stuff"" that the A9 chip had   while still achieving a die size of approximately 100 square   millimeters.What ""stuff"" could Apple put in?With the A8 chip, Apple used a quad-core graphics processor.   The A9 and the A10 each used six core graphics processors. I   suspect that the move to 10 nanometer for the A11 and then to 7   nanometer for the A12 will allow Apple to get much more   aggressive about increasing the graphics core count (and thus   graphics performance) of its next two iPhone models.Apple would also have more real estate to bulk up the sizes of   the other key functional blocks on the chip (i.e., image signal   processor, CPU, memory controller) to improve performance.Beyond the area shrinkTSMC says that its 7-nanometer process can deliver up to 40%   better performance at the same power as its 16-nanometer   technology or up to 65% lower power at the same performance   level.Image source: TSMC paper.Apple's A10 has two ""high-performance"" processor cores and two   ""high-efficiency"" cores and the chip can switch between them   based on the workload that the chip is required to run.I suspect that Apple will take full advantage of the two   ""extremes"" outlined here. The high-performance cores could get a   40% boost in frequency relative to what was possible on the A10,   while the high-efficiency cores could see a significant power   reduction while keeping performance flat to slightly up.The future looks bright for Apple's A seriesAlthough Apple's A10 chip is blazing fast today, advancements   in chip manufacturing technology coupled with architectural   innovations should allow Apple to make the A10 look ""slow"" within   a couple of years.Of course, app developers and Apple itself will have to find   ways to take full advantage of all that computing power (it's   unlikely that the A10 is being used to its full potential in most   apps today), but at least the hardware will be there.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Has Analysts Pounding the Table;12/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) has been a horrible investment in 2016. NOK stock is down 20%, and the company hasn't shown a profit all year. Asset levels are falling, cash flow is negative, and the share count is up.Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Yet some analysts are pounding the table for the stock. More than half have it on their buy lists and some, like Brian Nichols of BNL Finance, aredownright enthusiastic.He calls this a must-have stock for 2017.makeArticleAd();What do these analysts see that the market does not?It can't be thenew Nokia phone. That will be a rather ordinary smartphone runningAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Android operating system, made by a unit ofHon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd.(OTCMKTS:HNHPF) - theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) builders known as Foxconn - with the Nokia brandlicensed to a third party.Even if it's a hit it's not going to generate a lot of cash, or profit, for Nokia.Why do you need to buy Nokia now?A New NokiaFirst, this is not the same Nokia you remember. Today's Nokia is a major manufacturer of gear for public networks, following its purchase ofAlcatel-Lucent, whichclosed in January. Almost none of its current employees were working for the company in 2012.The Best Investments for 2017Afterthe disasters of the last decade, where it lost the mobile markets it once controlled, Nokia combined its equipment unit with that ofSiemens, got out of devices entirely, and sold its HERE mapping unit before pulling offthe $17.6 billion combinationwith Alcatel-Lucent, announced in April, 2015.All this means that the three chief switch brands of the 1990s are now under one roof, along with all those relationships with the world's wireless and wireline carriers.Nokia also has some great stuff to sell through that channel.Start with 5G wireless networking gear, a speed that will let people combine wireless and wireline contracts. Then add new fiber technology that lets wired carriers move data at 1,000 Gigabits/second, 1,000 times faster than the speeds advertised by Google Fiber and 250,000 times faster than the 4 Mbps FCC broadband standard.Bet on Rising Network Demand With NOK StockWhat it means is that buying Nokia today is a bet on demand for wireless and wireline services increasing dramatically over the next several years.That would seem to be a good bet.Carriers are already advertising TV services for phones, and combining with TV networksto deliver them, while throttling customer speeds because they can't fully deliver on the promise. Augmented reality games likePokemon GOareincreasing demand for bandwidth.Add the Internet of Things and virtual reality games like those already being advertised bySamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) for its Galaxy 7 phones and you have a lot of new demand for faster networks.The only question is whether carriers will budget the money to deliver on their promises.Equipment Always ChoppyRight now, the market cap for Nokia is roughly twice its annual revenue, and revenues in this space are notoriously choppy.The completion of LTE networks caused carriers to drop their orders for Nokia gearearlier this yearand we are only now at the front end of demand for 5G and super-fast broadband demand.Facebook Inc (FB), Alphabet Inc (FB) Shouldn't     Fear European RulingThe risk in Nokia stock today is that network operators who just finished spending big on LTE may be reluctant to raise the capital for 5Guntil demand is proven. You may have to wait for the payoff, which is why the stock still trades under $5 per share.If you get into Nokia now, you're catching the next wave of network spending at its bottom, and can ride that wave to profit. That is the bull case, and while that might take some time to prove out, it's a good bet carriers will spend again in the next three to five years.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

It had narrowed premature battery deaths to a tiny subset of devices and launched a repair program. Dead iPhones in China were linked to cheap third party power chargers. But now, the issue has flared up again.

It announced afree replacement program. When there were complaints about having to go to an Apple Store to confirm eligibility, it offered an online tool so iPhone 6s owners could check for themselves.When theChinese Consumer Association launched an investigationover iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 battery issues that could leave an iPhone crippled, AAPL acted. It found that every affected iPhone had been used with a cheap knock-off power charger, the kind Apple specifically warns against using.These faulty chargers killed the battery and in many cases damaged the motherboard, rendering the iPhone useless.Holiday Gift Guide 2016: The Best iPhone 7     CasesProblem(s) solved?

Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors: No More Headphone Jack?;12/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA new rumor claims that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will be missing a headphone jack.Source: SamsungAccording to this rumor, the tech company is planning to get rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack when the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes out next year. This would have it following the same design choice thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) went with when it released the iPhone 7 earlier this year.makeArticleAd();The rumor, which comes fromSamMobile, claims that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a USB Type-C port. This means that users will have to get headphones with a USB Type-C plug if they want to listen to music with the smartphone. That, or they could get a USB Type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.The same rumor that claims the Samsung Galaxy S8 won't have a headphone jack also claims it will have something new. This is stereo speakers. The lack of a headphone jack also means that there will be more room for the speakers. Plus, the device can be thinner with the headphone jack gone and may have a bigger battery.Another rumor concerning the Samsung Galaxy S8 is that itwon't have a physical home button. This isn't actually a major jump. There are already several other devices that useAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) Android operating system that don't have physical home buttons.If the physical home button on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is removed, it could mean that the new smartphone will have a sensor on the back or under the screen. There's been a lot of talk about Apple removing its home button in favor of a sensor under the screen.

The Supreme Court Sticks It to Apple Inc. (AAPL);12/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPatents make the tech world go 'round. And in the case of iPhone and consumer tech giantApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's the heart of what it does.Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrSure, there are patents that cover the ""guts"" of its successful i-line of products. But the real heart of AAPL - and why it's a powerhouse - comes down to design and aesthetics. So it's no surprise that Apple isn't afraid to stand its ground (and even go on the offensive) against rivals likeSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) orAlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Apple's war with Samsung - the best-publicized of the lot - just turned in Samsung's favor. TheSupreme Court just handed down a major victoryto the Korean electronics giant.But while Samsung might have won the latest battle, in the long run, it might not even matter to AAPL.The Supreme Court Says ""No"" to AppleBack in 2012, when Samsung's Galaxy line of smartphones was really beginning to challenge Apple for mobile supremacy, the whiz kids in Cupertino sued the Korean tech giant. Apple alleged that Samsung stole or used various patents and trademarks in its products. Specifically, the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, top ring/bezel and the now familiar and standardized colorful grid of icons that represent various apps on almost all smartphones.The 10 Best Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy for     2017The Galaxy line became one of the most successful series of smartphones outside of the iPhone. AAPL naturally didn't like that.Apple initially won the day back in 2012, scoring amassive $930 million settlementfrom Samsung that lower courts later cut down to about $550 million. That's not exactly chump change - especially one that had been stagnating before its Galaxy hit. So Samsung did what any firm would do. Itappealed the ruling once again.The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which brings us to the present day.The problem is the term ""article of manufacture."" It centers on the whether patent damages are calculated as a whole finished product (e.g., the entire phone), or just a component in the product, such as the buttons or case.The high court told Apple that it's just the component in question, and sent the case back to the lower courts for them to reconfigure the award. At stake is roughly $400 million in penalties that Samsung has already paid Apple.Big Issue at Play With AAPL StockThe money quote and bigger issue for Apple comes down to the money quote from Justice Sotomayor: ""An award of a defendant's entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world."" Also, ""Those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.""In short: If someone basically copies your design, only those pieces it copied will be subject to awards unless Congress acts to change that ""article of manufacture"" definition and the roughly 100-year-old law.For Apple, that's a problem. Technology patents are basically what separates and differentiates smartphone markers from each other. It keeps the riffraff from stealing AAPL's designs and using them to sell their own products. Apple's products aren't the most high-tech or powerful (sorry, they're not), but they are some of the best-designed out there. That's why Apple went to bat against Samsung in the first place.Closely watching the outcome of the legal battle between Apple and Samsung are tech giants such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet,Delland China'sLenovo. All have been targets of Apple's recent legal and patent war. The outcome of this case could (and likely will) significantly alter the outcomes of the other various cases on Apple's docket.It also could spur some lesser tech players to decide that it's worth the penalty to chase Apple's designs.Apple Inc. (AAPL): Is Apple Watch Circling the     Smartwatch Drain?Firms such asNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) - who have partnered with Apple and other tech firms on design projects - are nervously waiting to see the final outcome, too. It'll impact their ability to sue as well.For AAPL, The Award Isn't The IssueIf Apple has to send some cash back to Samsung because of the lower courts, it won't be the biggest problem. Apple has more than $230 billion in cash and investments.What's at issue is the patents and fierce protection of those design patents; what helped build that cash hoard in the first place.It's too early to tell what the overall effect will be. But the fact the highest court in the land just stripped Apple of a little protection decidedly isn't good for Apple.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Going to     $100The 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 201710 Losers That Will Be 2017's Best Stocks to     BuyThe postThe Supreme Court Sticks It to Apple Inc.

Intel Corporation VP Talks Contract Chip Manufacturing Business;12/1/2016;"For several years, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has made it clear that it aims to build a real   business out of playing contract chip manufacturer for chipmakers   that don't own chip manufacturing plants, also known as fabless   semiconductor companies.Intel engineers inside of a development factory. Image source:   Intel.makeArticleAd();Intel's revenue from this business today is essentially zero,   but the company is putting in significant effort to change that   situation. At a recent investor conference, Intel executive Stacy   Smith shared some insights into its fledgling foundry business.   Let's take a closer look.Addressing a tough questionAnalyst John Pitzer asked Smith the followingquestion: ""There [are] a lot of, I think, [views] out there in the   investment community that ... you [have] stringent design rules,   your higher cost of manufacturing just can't compete with the   flexibility and lower cost you need for a boarder based foundry.   How do you address this?""Smith began by admitting that Intel's capabilities in terms of   contract chip manufacturing ""over the last three or four years""   weren't anywhere near what more established foundries such asTaiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been offering.""It's a stretch to call it [a] foundry. You call it   semi-custom,"" Smith said.Smith pointed out that for a while, it lacked a lot of the key   tools and technologies required to support smaller customers.   That situation, the executive argued, has changed. He said the   company has built the capabilities ""to be much more what the rest   of the industry needs to be able to work with us as a foundry   partner.""What about cost?In addition to addressing the challenges that Intel has faced   in simply building up the capability to handle being a contract   chip manufacturer, remember that Pitzer's also raised a concern   that Intel's chip manufacturing technologies could be more   expensive than those of competing manufacturers.Smith argued that Intel can ""deliver a die cost that actually   is better than the cost through the third parties,"" but he was   careful to distinguish between per-chip cost (a.k.a. die cost)   and silicon wafer cost.""It's not wafer cost; it's die cost. And that's because of the   fact that we have higher density, we have better scaling, we have   the ability to, frankly, have better yields,"" Smith   explained.How can Smith's cost claim make sense?To understand what Smith is talking about, let's work through   an example. Let's suppose it costs $10,000 to buy a silicon wafer   from chip manufacturer A, and just $8,000 to buy a silicon wafer   from chip manufacturer B. Additionally, suppose that a chip that   measures in at 100 square millimeters in area on B's technology   can be implemented in an area of just 70 square millimeters in   A's technology.Under these assumptions, and under the additional assumption   of 100% manufacturing yields for both -- unrealistic in the real   world, but useful for this discussion -- the raw die cost of a   chip manufactured in B's technology would be about $13.33. That   same chip in A's technology would be $11.57.In other words, assuming constant yields, A's technology would   enable a cheaper-to-build chip than B's, despite its higher wafer   cost. If A's technology also delivered superior manufacturing   yields, then that would further tilt the cost-per-chip advantage   to A's favor.A big caveatThe major general-purpose contract chip manufacturers, such as   TSMC, usually offer customers a wide variety of chip   manufacturing technologies. These technologies range from   recently introduced processes (i.e., 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer)   to technologies that have been around for many years (i.e.,   55-nanometer, 40-nanometer).TSMC's revenue on those extremely mature technologies is   significant. Last quarter, 45% of the company's sales came from   technologies older than the 28-nanometer process that TSMC   introduced in 2011, and 69% of sales came from the 28-nanometer   and older technologies.Smith indicated that Intel's advantages apply to   ""leading-edge"" technologies, rather than to significantly older   technologies.""So we can be very competitive on a cost basis, but it has to   be at the leading edge,"" Smith explained. ""When you're talking   about n-2 [generation manufacturing technologies], and fully   depreciated factories and things like that, that really isn't our   business model.""Investor takeawaySmith paints an optimistic picture for Intel's contract chip   manufacturing efforts, but investors need to wait and see if the   company is ultimately able to land significant contract chip   manufacturing deals. The ones Intel has announced to date are   unlikely to move the needle for the chipmaker, but perhaps this   situation will change in the future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) In Talks to Acquire Smartwatch Pioneer Pebble;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) has been struggling. Sales of its wearables are slowing, it continues to be tied up in legal wrangles withJawbone, it faces manufacturing challenges with its latest devices andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has released a new generation of Apple Watch that's more focused on fitness than ever. Is the answer to Fitbit's problems aPebbleacquisition?Source: Fitbit/PebbleBecause according toFinancial Times, Fitbit is in ""advanced talks"" tobuy the smartwatch pioneer.makeArticleAd();What Would Fitbit Gain From a Pebble Acquisition?The first question that has to be asked in this sort of situation is obvious: What would Fitbit gain from a Pebble acquisition?That's a tough one to answer. Pebble is a smartwatch pioneer, but the privately held company has struggled since big consumer technology companies like Apple andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) decided to start selling smartwatches.Pebble was a success - on Kickstarter - but its sales are a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers the big companies put out. According to IDC, in the third quarter,Pebble accounted for just 3.2% of worldwide smartwatch sales- despite market leader Apple tanking by dropping over 71% year-over-year.The 10 Best Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy for     2017A Pebble acquisition would gain the fitness wearable company a collection of new smartwatches (Pebble has recently begun rolling out a new generation of devices) and the PebbleOS operating system.Few people are buying the smartwatches - whose primary claims to fame are low cost and long battery life due to use of an E Ink display - but PebbleOS does have developer support and a healthy collection of apps. It's also a smartwatch platform that works with both iOS and Android.However, Fitbit devices also work with both Android and iOS, and Fitbit's ""smart fitness watch,"" the Fitbit Blaze, covers much of the smartwatch needs of most casual users, including notifications. And Fitbit already has week-long or longer battery life nailed without having to resort to the dull, low resolution display used by Pebble.Pebble was trying to steer its smartwatch line-up into fitness tracking territory, so thereported $40 million pricemay ultimately boil down to cheaply eliminating a potential nuisance rival, taking on some of its key engineers and gaining ownership ofPebble's patents.Pebble Has Been Here Before…The history of Pebble has been one of struggles and rumored buy-outs. Past alleged suitors have includedApplein 2013, as that company was ramping up Apple Watch development.TechCrunchreports that last year,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) showed interest andCitizen Watch(OTCMKTS:CHCLF) offered $740 million for the company -but was turned down.The common denominator in each of these was a company looking to fast-track smartwatch development. But now, most of the players who want to be in that market have their own platform, so Pebble's value as an ""instant in"" has tanked.A year after turning down the Citizen deal, Pebble was laying off staff, trying to raise more money on Kickstarter and is now apparently ready to sell for a small fraction of that price.Will a Pebble Deal Boost FIT Stock?Buying Pebble is at least making a move in the smartwatch space and at $40 million, the price is almost trivial. It seems doubtful that Fitbit will continue to manufacture Pebble smartwatches for any length of time -they aren't exactly popular. If Fitbit can make use of Pebble's patents and engineers and possibly incorporate some of PebbleOS into its own products, that could prove useful in competing against Apple and company, and could eventual move Fitbit stock in the right direction.Holiday Gift Guide 2016: The Best     SmartphonesIf nothing else, it gives the image that Fitbit is doingsomethingto address its woes.And if all the IP comes to naught, maybe the company offers Pebble watch owners a discount to buy a new Fitbit and at least recoups some customers.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldThe Best Investments for 2017The postFitbit Inc (FIT) In Talks to Acquire Smartwatch Pioneer Pebbleappeared first onInvestorPlace."

In particular, theGalaxy S7 Edgeis one of the best looking smartphones of the year - if not ever.It's also water resistant, has a great camera and supports wireless charging. Oh, and Samsung brought back the ability to cheaply expand storage using inexpensive microSD cards.Besides offering stellar performance, the Galaxy S7 Edge sports the curved OLED display thatApple is rumored to be hoping for with the iPhone 8. But, if you gift someone with a Galaxy S7 Edge, they not only get a top-notch Android smartphone, they get the look that Apple is coveting a year before Apple fans get a shot at it.Holiday Gift Guide 2016 (The Best Smartphones): LG G5LG Display Co Ltd.(NYSE:LPL) has built a reputation for designing high-quality Android smartphones that tend to fly under the radar.Source: LGFor power Android users who aren't stuck on Samsung, theLG G5is one of the best smartphones of 2016. It's definitely one of the more high-tech models, too.Like the iPhone 7 Plus, LG went with a dual-camera system on the G5. But, while Apple made one of its cameras a telephoto zoom, LG went in the other direction by making one a wide-angle lens. That makes the G5 great for taking photos of outdoors scenery and sprawling cities.Hottest Manufacturing Stocks NowThe other cool thing about the G5 is its semi-modular design. You can't upgrade key components, but you can swap out the bottom bezel for different accessories such as the Cam Plus (camera grip with extra battery) or Hi-Fi Plus (a DAC for superior audio). Gadget geeks will love this one…Holiday Gift Guide 2016 (The Best Smartphones): Google Pixel PhoneThe newest flagship smartphone to hit the market is also one of the hottest. And, it's already topping many ""best smartphone"" lists for 2016.Source: GoogleThePixel Phonefrom Google isAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) first smartphone under under its own branding.Premium metal and glass design, a high resolution display and a camera that rivals - and potentially bests - the iPhone 7 are among the Pixel's highlights. Of course, being a Google Phone it ships with the latest Android operating system (Nougat) and will get priority updates going forward.The Pixel Phone also gets exclusive access to Google Assistant, the latest and greatest AI-powered virtual assistant.The only real downside to this smartphone is its lack of water resistance. So, if you pick one up for a special someone, you might want to consider slipping a waterproof case into their stocking.Holiday Gift Guide 2016 (The Best Smartphones): Moto ZIf you're shopping for a phone as a gift for someone who prizes sleek design, theMoto ZfromLenovo Group Limited(OTCMKTS:LNVGY) is worthy of consideration.Source: LenovoThe Moto Z could be one of the best smartphones of 2016, no matter how you cut it. It's fast, packs a nice camera with optical image stabilization, a Quad HD display and all-day battery life with 8-hour quick charge in just 15 minutes.Like the iPhone 7, it lacks a headphone jack (so consider Bluetooth headphones as an accompanying gift) and like the LG G5, it offers some modular upgrades. In this case, you could add a 10x optimal zoom camera or a projector.But, what really grabs people's attention when they pick up the Moto Z is how thin it is. The aluminum case is razor-thin at just 0.2 inches, making it the world's thinnest smartphone.And, for someone who wants the sleekest Android smartphone out there, combined with modular upgradability - the Moto Z is, perhaps, the ultimate Christmas gift.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHoliday Gift Guide 2016: 5 Bluetooth Headphones     for iPhone 7 OwnersHoliday Gift Guide: Best High-Tech Gifts Under     $500The postHoliday Gift Guide 2016: The Best Smartphonesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Intel Corp.'s Big Spending Isn't Due to a Potential Apple Inc. Deal;12/1/2016;"Analyst Romit Shah with Instinet (by way ofBarron's) recently offered up some commentary around microprocessor giantIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) planned higher-than-expected operating expenses   for next year.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();One possibility that Shah points out is that Intel could be   investing heavily in support of a potential contract chip   manufacturing deal withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Intel currently designs and builds the processors that power   Apple's Mac computers, but the A-series processors that power its   iPhone and iPad product lines are designed by Apple and   manufactured by other chipmakers, such asTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .""We have no insight into discussions between Intel and Apple,   but within our mosaic, we believe an Apple foundry win would be   highly sensitive, which might explain why Intel is being   uncharacteristically vague in its communication and waiting until   its analyst day in February to provide more details on spending,""   Shah writes.Shah also says that ""a high-volume foundry win for Intel would   materially increase operating expenses."" He goes on to add that   ""part of Intel's value-add as a foundry is that the company takes   on design work for the customer.""Here's why I don't think this explanation holds water.Why Intel is being so vague about 2017     spendingIn the past, Intel would issue its full-year financial   guidance in January and then go into further detail on the key   business and financial details during an analyst day held in the   spring. However, former Intel CEO Paul Otellini retired in May   2013, so the company had to push out what would have been an   analyst day in May to November 2013. In 2014 and 2015, Intel   hosted its analyst days in November. The company would probably   have hosted its next analyst day this month, had it not undergone   a CFO transition in September.I suspect that the reason Intel is being so vague at this   point is that it usually saves these details for either the end   of a given fiscal year or its analyst day, whichever happens to   come first.Would operating expenses really go up a bunch for     Intel?The next point that Shah makes is that if Intel were to build   Apple's chips for it, it would also have to take on a significant   amount of the design work. To understand what Shah is talking   about, it's important to step back and review the two basic   development models for fabless-semiconductor companies -- i.e.,   chip companies that outsource the manufacture of their chips to   third-party manufacturers.There's what is known as the ""customer-owned tooling,"" or COT   model, and there's also the application-specific integrated   circuit, or ASIC, model. The following passage fromEETimessuccinctly describes the differences between the two:""Traditionally, COT companies designed integrated circuits to   the physical design level (GDSII) and sent those designs directly   to foundries to manufacture the wafers. COT companies then   outsourced to assembly, package, and test vendors. An ASIC   vendor, on the other hand, provides a turnkey service, managing   physical design to delivery of packaged and tested parts.""Intel offers services analogous to the ASIC model, but these   days Apple is almost certainly operating under the COT model,   meaning that it does the heavy lifting on the chip   implementation.So if Intel and Apple were to strike a chip-manufacturing   deal, I doubt that Intel would be implementing Apple's chip   design, though there is still an intense amount of collaboration   that must happen between chip manufacturer and chip designer.For some financial perspective, TSMC, a company that supports   hundreds of fabless chipmakers, including Apple, incurred total   operating expenses -- R&D as well as SG&A -- of $2.79   billion in 2015.I find it hard to believe that Apple alone could move the   operating expense needle for Intel at this point.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders FEAR the iPhone 8?;11/30/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSmartphone fans who have been eagerly waiting for an early glimpse of the iPhone 8 fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) finally got their wish. Some rumored specs were unveiled this week. And while not all of them (so far) were terribly surprising, AAPL stock holders were probably encouraged to know the device is apt to be everything it was touted to be.Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashAnd yet, for owners ofApple stock, the advent of the iPhone 8 isn't exactlyexciting.makeArticleAd();While the early arms-length reviews of the smartphone have been mostly glowing so far, AAPL stock holders know all too well that the company is fighting a headwind. At best, a successful launch of the iPhone 8 buys time.At worst, a tepid launch of the iPhone 8 will prove iPhone mania has run its course.An Early Outlook for the iPhone 8Bear in mind that much can still change between now and then. But as it stands right now,next year's iPhone 8 should consist of an OLED display, a completely curved glass form, wireless charging and no more home button. The camera should also be significantly upgraded,perhaps even capable of taking 3D pictures. Moreover, the iPhone 8 is expected to be available in three sizes, including a 5.5-inch version.10 Losers That Will Be 2017's Best Stocks to     BuyThe usual suspects have already gone ga-ga over the device because … well, that's just what a good-sized sliver of the crowd does whenever AAPL serves up a new product.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is one of the phone's biggest fans,judging from his sales expectations. Kuo believes sales of the iPhone 8 will be ""unprecedented,"" with the company possibly shipping between 90 million and 110 million units during the second half of the coming year. That would be impressive, even if the next-generation iPhone is indeed alower-margin device.But owners of AAPL stock may want to take such lofty projections with a grain of salt, as no one has answered the critical question.What the heck went wrong with the iPhone 7?Consumers Don't Always Do What They SayTo be clear, the critical sales figures for the iPhone 7 (and 7+) aren't out yet; the current quarter is the important one. But UBS estimates thatorders for iPhones for Q4 2016 (allmodels) never quite matched Q4 2015's peak. It also believes orders for Q1 2017 are down overall on a year-over-year basis.That's a bit of a letdown to AAPL stock holders, considering how ballyhooed the iPhone 7 was leading up to its launch.The knee-jerk explanation is that consumers are simply holding off on an upgraded iPhone, knowing the iPhone 8 is going to be a significantly more compelling device than the iPhone 7 was relative to the 6 and the 6s. Problem is, we've heard that before, and consumers didn't always come through when the time came.Cases(s) in point:Owners of the 5s model were supposed to be waiting for the iPhone 7. It doesn't appear they pulled the trigger in a meaningful way. The iPhone 6s was deemed by some to be the ""biggest incremental upgrade"" ever for any iPhone (from the 6), yetthe 6s failed to even come close to meeting expectations.Maybe those would-be buyers were holding off on the iPhone 7.By that same rationale, it stands to reason that anyone waiting for the iPhone 8 may be willing to wait another year for the iPhone 8s or iPhone 9. They've held off before.And it's in that light where Apple's key sales message may be coming back to haunt it and, by extension, Apple stock. That is, AAPL has gotten so good as saying ""just wait until you see what we do with the next iPhone"" that consumers are doingexactly that.Two Possible Outcomes for AAPL StockTo that end, there are two potential outcomes with the iPhone 8, neither of which is going to prove bullish (long-term) for Apple shares.One plausible outcome is that the iPhone 8 ends up being the smashing success many people seem to think it will be, with the company selling 100 million units in the back half of 2017. That's certainly possible - if all those 5, 5s and even 4 and 4s usersfinally make the upgrade.But if that ""powder keg"" should explode, a huge swath of iPhone fans will have no reason to upgrade for years. That's a problem, as Apple's best target market for new devices is owners of old devices.This could make 2017 a very good year for Apple stock … but it could also leave no gas in the tank for 2018 and even 2019.Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Beat Microsoft     Corporation's (MSFT) HoloLens?The second plausible outcome is that the iPhone 8 doesn't draw the kind of crowd it's expected to in the first place, with would-be customers content with the post-buzz (and likely cheaper) iPhone 7 at the time. Or worse, with those consumersopting for the very impressive alternative phonefromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), or one ofSamsung Electronics'(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) many options.Don't dismiss the idea that the iPhone can be pushed around now. Apple was already losing smartphone market share even before the iPhone 8/iPhone 7 debate surfaced, and is expected to keep losing market share through 2020. If the iPhone 8 fails to convincingly reverse that trend - and it's a distinct possibility - investors can safely close the book on iPhone mania.Either outcome is worrisome.Bottom Line for Apple StockAs is obligatory whenever someone dares to point out that Apple isn't infallible … no, Apple isn't doomed; no, I don't have a short position in Apple stock; and no, I'm not being paid to bash the company. My only aim has been and still is to look at the company from a minority angle that the rest of the mainstream media won't, or can't.Regardless, there are legitimate concerns that current and would-be owners of AAPL stock need to digest. There will come a point in time when Apple runs out of an army buyers for each new product launch. There will be a time when competitors finally catch up. There will be a time when Apple fatigue sets in and it's no longer the hip/chic/status brand it used to be.It looks like we're getting awfully close to that time.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Apple Inc.

Future Uncertain For Samsung (SSNLF) As Company Considers Split;11/29/2016;"Shares of Korean electronics manufacturer SamsungSSNLFfell more than 12.2% Tuesday after the company announced that it will consider possible changes to its corporate structure, including possibly splitting the company, following a series of adviser reviews.The latest news from Samsung comes as a response to heavy activist pressure from Elliot Associates, a firm that holds less than 1% of the company but recently launched a campaign to compel executives to tidy up its governance and provide better value to shareholders.Samsung did not comment specifically on any restructuring plans beyond the adviser reviews, which will be completed in no more than six months.""We want to be absolutely clear that that the review does not indicate the management or the board's intention one way or another,"" said Robert Yi, head of investor relations at Samsung. ""We remain absolutely neutral at this point and will make a decision only after the review is complete.""Although Samsung did not present any restructuring plans yet, the company did comment on the concerns regarding shareholder returns. Samsung said it will allot 50% of its free cash flow in 2016 and 2017 to give back to shareholders; the company also said that it will increase total dividends by 30% this year.Samsung also suggested that it will be appointing new members to its board of directors. These new board members will apparently have global experience, and the company will also be setting up a new governance committee made up of only independent directors.Samsung's new plans come in the wake of a disastrous scandal involving its Galaxy Note 7 phone, which was found to spontaneously combust. The ""exploding"" phones were recalled, opening the door for competitors like AppleAAPLto scoop up loyal customers.The Korean manufacturer is also sure to be feeling the overall distrust of its domestic economy right now. On Tuesday, South Korean President Park Guen-hye offered to resign before her term is up amid a corruption and influence-peddling scandal.One final bit of news to note, especially for American investors, is that Elliot Associates has suggested that Samsung list on the Nasdaq as a means of increasing shareholder liquidity.Stocks that Aren't in the News.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Introduce an iPhone Pro in 2017;11/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is under considerable pressure to deliver a smash hit when it unveils the next new iPhone in 2017. Sales are down, and margins are being pressured.Source: AppleHowever, now it's possible that Apple may fight back against both of those problems next year by releasing an iPhone Pro alongside the iPhone 8.makeArticleAd();The All-Glass iPhone 8We've previously reported that the case continues to mount for anall-glass iPhone 8. With 2017 being the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone's releaseandthe first year in a three-year development cycle AAPL has adopted for its smartphones, it's time for a big change.Adding a glass back to the glass front will ensure that no one mistakes the iPhone 8 for a previous model (one of the complaints about the iPhone 7). It would differentiate AAPL's smartphones from the metal-backed look it first made popular, but is now the norm among Android smartphones. A glass back also makes wireless recharging more efficient, and Apple is known to be actively pursuing that feature.What about earlier rumors of a curved-screen iPhone in 2017?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Surface Phone     Could Crush Apple, SamsungThat's where the case for an iPhone Pro starts to become more clear.A Curved OLED Display iPhone Pro?It has been suspected for months that AAPL has been pursuing anew iPhone with a curved, OLED display- something along the lines of rivalSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy S7 Edge.However, a report in theWall Street Journalsuggests two problems with that plan. First, ramping up OLED production on a scale to meet iPhone 8 demand may not be possible. Companies that make OLED panels - including Samsung andLG- face multibillion-dollar expenditures to bring that level of capacity on line, and time is short.The second issue is cost. According to theWSJ, an OLED display could add $50 to the manufacturing cost of the iPhone 8. Considering a$649 iPhone 7 is estimated to cost AAPL $225 to manufacture, going to the OLED display would mean AAPL either hiking prices or taking another hit to its already squeezed profit margins.Neither option is palatable. That's where the idea of an iPhone Pro comes into play.iPhone Pro Could Solve Two AAPL ProblemsAs suggested by9to5Mac, Apple could stick with its current LCD displays for the iPhone 8 models next year, butadd a new higher-tier, premium iPhone Prothat incorporates the fancy curved OLED display.This strategy would give AAPL the curved screen look to splash across its marketing campaigns. The all-glass iPhone 8 still would look cool - and different from the past three years - without the additional pressure on margins of incorporating an OLED display. Meanwhile, the company could follow the model it has adopted with the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, charging a significant premium for an iPhone Pro.An iPhone Pro may not sell in the same quantities as the iPhone 8, but by positioning it as a new flagship device with a key differentiating feature, AAPL could charge a much higher premium for it.How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Should Shell Out     Its CashNaturally, we will have no idea about which direction Apple chooses to take until next September.The WSJpoints out that Apple is considering more than 10 new iPhone prototypes, so the final decision on models is very much up in the air at this point.However, by going with a mainstream iPhone 8 release and adding a new iPhone Pro to the mix in 2017, Apple would not only boost iPhone sales in a meaningful way, it also could introduce premium pricing into the mix to help offset the downward pressure on its profit margins.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldThe 5 Best ETFs That Invest in Tech StocksBuy Macy's Inc (M) Stock for Some Christmas     CheerThe postApple Inc.

Apple Inc. May Be First to Adopt This Tech;11/28/2016;"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) , or TSMC for short, is going to be bringing its   10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology to market early next   year. This new technology is expected to deliver better   performance and significantly lower chip areas than what its   current 16-nanometer technology is capable of.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();TSMC has made it very clear that it expects to recognize   revenue from 10-nanometer products in the first quarter of 2017.   According to a new report from DigiTimes, it looks as ifApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the first customer to use this   technology.Next-gen iPad Pro reportedly to go into production in     DecemberDigiTimes says Apple's upcoming iPad with a 10.5-inch display   is expected to begin mass production in December, with shipments   beginning in the first quarter of 2016. That new iPad, DigiTimes   reports, will be powered by Apple's next-generation A10X   tablet-specific applications processor. The current-generation   iPad Pro models use Apple's A9X chip.There is significant evidence in the public domain to suggest   that the A10X will be manufactured in TSMC's new 10-nanometer   tech rather than its current 16-nanometer technology. Such   evidence includes theLinkedIn profilesof Apple chip engineers, as well as areportfrom well-connected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.If Apple is beginning mass production of the next-generation   iPad Pro models in December, that means the company will need   production-quality A10X chips to go inside them. If we assume   that it takes about three months to build a chip from start to   finish, then for A10X chips to be ready to support December iPad   production, that production needs to have begun ahead of   time.To that end, TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said on the company's third   quarter earnings call that the company has ""transferred   10-nanometer from [research and development] to production in the   third quarter of this year."" He also said the company's   ""first 10-nanometer customer product has been produced with   reasonable yield.""It's certainly plausible, and indeed very likely, that the   chip that TSMC was talking about was the A10X. Everything seems   to line up perfectly.A10X paves the way for A11TSMC's commentary in regard to the yield rate for its first   10-nanometer product doesn't suggest that said yields are by any   means great. I suspect that both TSMC and rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which recently began production ofQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon 835 chip, rushed to get their   respective 10-nanometer technologies into production to meet   their customers' strict product-release schedules.The Snapdragon 835 needs to be available to power flagship   Android smartphones in the March-April time-frame, the A10X   needed to be ready for an early 2017 iPad launch, and Qualcomm   rival MediaTek has said that its own 10-nanometer mobile   applications processor, manufactured by TSMC and known as the   Helio X30, will ship in the first half of 2017.The A10X and the Helio X30 are likely to ship in low volumes,   but they should be instrumental in helping TSMC to further boost   its 10-nanometer manufacturing yields. The technology is going to   need to be in top shape to support Apple's next-generation A11   chip that's set to power Apple's next-generation iPhones.Considering how big a deal Apple's next-generation iPhones are   expected to be in terms of unit shipments, Apple really can't   afford any significant supply bottlenecks. But it's very likely   that by the time Apple starts building the next-generation iPhone   models, TSMC's 10-nanometer tech will be in solid shape.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How Samsung's Harman Acquisition Could Be Good News for Under Armour;11/25/2016;"Image source: Harman.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)announcedon Nov. 14 that it has agreed to acquire the technology companyHarman International(NYSE: HAR)  in a $8 billion all-cash deal that looks to be   Samsung's overt push into the ""connected car"" market. Harman has   been increasingly geared toward car navigation services and other   ""connected car"" car tech as part of its various business lines,   so the move makes sense as Samsung seeks to gain stronger footing   in this market. However, there are a few ways that this deal   could also be a major boost for the sports apparel and technology   companyUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UA-C) .Under Armour's Harman JBL PartnershipOne of Harman's various tech sub-brands is the audio and   headphone company JBL, which among other thing makes sports   headphones.Under Armour teamed up with Harman JBLearlier this year when it released its Healthbox tech bundle that   -- along with a fitness tracking wristband and connected scale --   included wireless bluetooth headphones. Most recently, Under   Armour and JBL released an updated version of the sport wireless   headphones that now include a heart rate tracking feature. The   headphones connect to the wristband or Under Armour's fitness   tracking mobile app (Record) to show users their heart rate.makeArticleAd();Image source: Under Armour.Combining the two brands in a product like this has major   benefits for both. For Under Armour, it's a chance to further its   goal of becoming a tech-focused company, while also diversifying   away from typical wearable products that are made by so many   competitors. For Harman JBL, it's a chance to get access to the   more than 190 million users that Under Armour has across its   mobile fitness app ecosystem, while also increasing its brand   name among fitness enthusiasts.Image source: Under Armour.Why a partnership with Samsung could be big for Under   ArmourPartnering with Harman JBL was a great way for Under Armour to   break further into the tech world, but being partnered now with   Samsung could have far larger benefits.Similar toApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  and its 2014 purchase of the audio and   headphone company Beats, Samsung could use its acquisition of the   Harman JBL brand to help further its own audio segment with its   mobile phones. We saw with the iPhone 7 that Apple has put   much more focus on eliminating cords and cables by forgoing the   headphone jack. When Samsung's next generation of Galaxy and Note   mobile phones come out (assuming they don't blow up) there is   likely to be a similar focus on using bluetooth capabilities to   eliminate cords, possibly using JBL brand headphones as an option   for wireless headphones.Another interesting aspect of this move for Under Armour is   that it could help to bring its Record app further into the   smartwatch industry. Similar to the way thatNikehas partnered with Apple to make aNike+ branded Apple Watch 2with a focus on specific Nike features like the pre-loaded Nike+   app, Under Armour could someday be the perfect counterpart for   Samsung and its own smartwatches. An Under Armour-branded Samsung   smartwatch with the Record app pre-loaded would help Under   Armour's international presence and technology focus immensely,   while helping Samsung to compete with Apple in the   fitness-focused smartwatch market.Samsung's acquisition of Harman does seem to be mostly a push   into the car market that many other tech companies, including   Apple, have also been vying for. Since the deal won't close until   mid-2017, any ideas about other aspects of this move are all   speculation. Still, the idea that Under Armour is now partnered   with one of the largest tech and smartphone companies in the   world is probably very good news for the sports company and its   long-term shareholders.10 stocks we like better than SamsungWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Have We Really Reached Peak Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock?;11/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) cannot seem to catch a proper break nowadays.Apple stockhas tumbled 5% two weeks after the company released fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, but failed to deliver the expected blowout quarter thanks to shrinking iPhone sales.Source:FlickrLong-suffering investors, however, got a glimmer of hope when the company issued somewhat upbeat Q1 2017 revenue guidance of $76 billion-$78 billion and gross margin range of 38%-38.5%.makeArticleAd();That revenue represents small, but significant, year-over-year growth, and will mark the first time Apple returns to positive growth territory in four quarters. If things actually pan out this way, it would help to dispel fears that peak iPhone is now behind us and give a nice boost to Apple stock.Not So FastBut now a kill-joy analyst has warned investors to quit doing the victory dance. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo has warned that Apple mightfall short of its Q1 estimatesand could see weakness in Q2 as well. Kuo has modeled Q1 iPhone shipments of 40 million-50 million, which falls short of the 51.2 million units shipped during last year's corresponding quarter. Given that iPhone ASP has fallen by more than 10% compared to a year ago, that would mean another dramatic sales contraction.Kuo also warned that Q2 would face tough comps since it won't have the benefit of the iPhone SE this time around. Apple is, understandably, not keen on an upgrade for the $399 model, which could cannibalize high-end models and dilute margins. Without the benefit of SE, Kuo expects Q2 iPhone shipments to clock in at just 35 million-40 million, compared to 40.4 million a year ago.10 Stocks the Smart Money Likes Right NowKuo, though, says the upshot to this is that Apple will pressure its suppliers to cut prices, which in turn will help preserve margins. Apart from a select few companies, such asSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), most AAPL suppliers lack the bargaining power to negotiate better terms when the going gets tough.iPhone 8 Super-Cycle?This certainly does not bode well for Apple stock. The iPhone 7 was expected to stem the year-over-year revenue declines at the very least, but this might not happen. Ming-Chi Kuo has been consistently accurate at making iPhone sales projections in the past. In fact, he has been regarded asone of the best Apple analystsin some quarters.If the guy's estimates are within the ballpark this time around, it means Apple will string together six quarters of revenue declines, something that even perma-bulls will have a hard time dealing with. If things play out this way, it's going to become incredibly hard to brush aside the bears with their ""peak-iPhone-is-history"" meme.Maybe we can chalk this up to a saturation problem, together with growing competition. After all, when growth in China, erstwhile Apple's fastest-growing and most promising market, is no longer forthcoming, there's reason to be worried.The iPhone 7 has not been very well-received in China: only 43% of consumers have expressed interest in the smartphone, compared to 64% for the iPhone 6. This situation is perfectly understandable. After all, it probably does not make a lot of sense to buy an iPhone in China when you can get a device that is roughly comparable in looks and performance at half the price fromXiaomiandHuawei. And, with tens of millions of Chinese now toting an iPhone, you can bet the device is probably no longer the status symbol it used to be.Many analysts remain optimistic that the iPhone 8 will usher in a super-cycle that will encourage mass upgrades. The next iPhone iteration is expected to sport exciting features such as wireless charging, an organic-light-emitting-diode (OLED) screen and a better camera. AAPL might even throw in a full-touch display without any physical buttons, just for good measure. The new iPhone is expected to hit the market sometime around September 2017. But, will powerful features alone suffice to entice users to ditch their old devices and rush to their nearest Apple Store?Chances are that Apple's user-friendly Upgrade Program might be enough to do just that. After all, the program has eliminated the financial cliff that consumers used to face during each upgrade cycle by replacing it with almost forgettable monthly bills. Ironically, iPhone 8 rumors might be partly responsible for lackluster iPhone 7 sales.Bottom Line on Apple StockIt's not inconceivable that even the iPhone 8, with all its wizardry, might fail to do the job. Apple stock investors will then have to hope that one of AAPL's several pipeline projects hits pay dirt, or that the company uses its huge cash pile to make a big strategic acquisition.Despite its generous capital return program, Apple is still sitting on a cash hoard north of $200 billion, though most of it is stashed in overseas accounts.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in     2017However, with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, AAPL might be able to repatriate some of that cash without taking a huge tax hit. Trump had promised a repatriation holiday of 10% for the more than $2 trillion parked in overseas accounts by American companies.He even pledged to undertake the biggest tax revolution since Ronald Reagan's presidency that would see no American company paying more than 15% in corporate tax versus the current rate of 35%. Investors can only hope that this was not just another instance of campaign hyperbole.If that happens, expect Apple stock to make a strong comeback.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $103 High-Dividend Stocks for 2017 and BeyondThe postHave We Really Reached Peak Apple Inc.

1 Way Qualcomm Inc. Is Leaving Intel Corporation in the Dust;11/23/2016;"Wireless-chip specialistQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced its next-generation premium   mobile processor, called the Snapdragon 835. The processor   promises to provide more computing, graphics, and wireless   performance than Qualcomm's prior-generation Snapdragon 820 and   821 chips. It is also, asMashablepoints out, ""the chip that will power every premium Android phone   in 2017.""Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Perhaps most interestingly, it will be manufactured usingSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) 10-nanometer chip technology. This,   Qualcomm apparently boasted, means that its mobile chips have now   taken the lead in terms of chip manufacturing technology away   from processors targeted at personal computers.Image source:Fudzilla.What Qualcomm seems to be implying is that it's now beating   microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which supplies most of the world's   personal-computer processors, at its own game.Let's take a closer look at what's going on here.Is Qualcomm a full generation ahead of Intel?To be clear, the contract chip manufacturers have been playing   games with how they name their chip manufacturing technologies.   Intel's 14-nanometer technology is widely believed to be   significantly ahead of the 14/16-nanometer chip manufacturing   technologies fielded by Samsung andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) in terms of chip area and potentially   performance.In fact, Intel argues that the technologies that the contract   chip manufacturers call ""10-nanometer"" is very similar, at least   in terms of chip area, to what Intel's 14-nanometer technology   can achieve -- though even Intel admits that those competing   10-nanometer technologies are denser than Intel's 14-nanometer   technology.Image source: Intel presentation.So for Qualcomm to imply that it's a full generation ahead of   Intel is an example of marketing at work. Further, Intel is   planning to introduce the first products built on its own   10-nanometer technology in late 2017, which should allow it to   pull decisively ahead again -- at least for a little while.That's not the point, though. The point is that, as   Qualcomm pointed out in a presentation, mobile processors have   gone from being manufacturing-technology laggards relative to the   personal-computer industry to being arguably in a leadership   position in just five years.That reflects positively on Qualcomm and its manufacturing   partners and negatively on Intel and its chip-manufacturing   division.Does Intel plan to fix this?The major contract chip manufacturers have made it clear that   they plan to continue advancing chip-manufacturing technology at   an unrelenting pace. TSMC, for example, is expected to start   mass-producing chips on its 10-nanometer technology this year and   intends to start building chips on a next-generation 7-nanometer   technology in early 2018.TSMC's 7-nanometer technology should be comparable in terms of   chip area to Intel's 10-nanometer technology, though it's not   clear whether one company's technology will have an advantage in   this metric. Intel, on the other hand, has told investors that   its 10-nanometer technology will go into production in the second   half of 2017. Further, the company says it plans to use   derivatives of that technology, performance enhanced, for three   full product generations.Performance enhancements over time are certainly welcome, as   they allow Intel to build better products with each generation.   However, the fact that Intel has backed off on shrinking chip   areas at a two-year cadence while its competitors aim to stay on   that pace is a red flag.I believe that Intel needs to increase its investments in   chip-manufacturing technology and work tirelessly to try to   regain an unequivocal and lasting technology leadership position.   Otherwise it risks eventually being left in the dust by the top   mobile-chip sellers and their contract chip manufacturers.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc.'s Mysterious OLED iPhone Revealed;11/23/2016;"For a while now, reliable rumors have suggested thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) plans to launch not two, but three new iPhone   models next year. Those same rumors suggest that Apple will put   out two variants with traditional liquid crystal displays, or   LCDs, with a third ultra-high end version sporting a curved   organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Thanks to a new report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI   Securities, by way ofMacRumors, we now have more information about this this, OLED-packing   iPhone.It'll have a large display, but...Kuo acknowledges that there's an apparent disconnect between   his prior report that the next iPhone lineup could feature a   model with a 5.8-inch OLED display and his new comments claiming   that the OLED iPhone could have a 5.1-inch to 5.2-inch   display.He has a good reconciliation: ""We predict OLED iPhone will   adopt a 5.7-5.8 [inch] flexible OLED panel,"" Kuo begins.   ""Nonetheless, for 'specific design purposes', the actual active   area may be around 5.1-5.2 [inches].""A large (curved) display in a small footprint? Sounds   familiarIf the notion of a large display in a relatively small   footprint sounds familiar, it's because that was one of the   things that was quite nice aboutSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S7 Edge released earlier this year.   That phone packs a 5.5-inch curved OLED display, as measured   along the diagonal. However, because the display curves into the   sides, the phone's physical footprint isn't much larger than that   of the Galaxy S7 with a 5.1-inch flat display.Apple's transition to a curved OLED display should allow it to   achieve something similar.Calling it now -- this phone is going to sell like crazyAlthough the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus appear to be doing   well in the marketplace, I believe that next year's curved OLED   model has the potential to sell like crazy.First, a significant change in form factor and display   technology will probably result in an incredibly   impressive-looking device. Apple has been fielding devices with   largely the same look and feel for three generations now, so   there could be a sizable portion of the iPhone installed base   that'll get quite excited for a significant change in those   areas.Those iPhone owners who have been holding off on upgrading   until Apple delivered such dramatic changes could finally hop on   board once this OLED iPhone is out. Additionally, I suspect that   there are some individuals who prefer the Apple ecosystem and iOS   but ultimately opted for phones such as the Galaxy S7 Edge   because they liked the curved display. Those customers could come   back once the OLED iPhone is available to purchase.Indeed, it's hard not to see the parallels between what   happened with the iPhone 6 and what could potentially happen with   the OLED iPhone. Remember that before the iPhone 6 generation,   Apple didn't offer customers iPhone models with large screens.   This decision probably cost Apple some business during the iPhone   5s generation. However, once the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus   arrived, Apple saw significant market share gains and even   pull-ins of iPhone upgrades.Once Apple begins fielding smartphones with curved OLED   displays, even if they are relatively pricey, I think the company   will be once again poised to take share from high-end Android   smartphone makers. And, perhaps, the company could see another   pull-in of iPhone demand.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. Might Be Preparing for Blowout iPhone Sales in Fiscal 2018;11/21/2016;"Bloomberg recently published an articlediscussingApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) desire to add organic light-emitting diode   (OLED) based displays to next year's iPhones and the supply-chain   challenges that Apple faces in trying to do so.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();""The supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just   one version of the next generation iPhone, push back adoption of   the technology or other snags,"" the authors write.Separately, generally reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi   Kuo said in a recentreportthat Apple is preparing three iPhone models -- 4.7-inch and   5.5-inch models with traditional liquid crystal displays, and a   5.1- to 5.2-inch version with a curved OLED display.Circling back to the report from Bloomberg, the authors of   that report say that ""Apple's initial OLED order fromSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is for 100 million units over one year,   according to people familiar with the agreement.""If both reports are true, then this could suggest something   incredibly positive for Apple investors: Apple might be preparing   for a surge in its iPhone business during its fiscal year   2018.Some perspectiveIn fiscal year 2016, Apple shipped just shy of 212 million   iPhone models. This included iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s,   iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, and an initial batch of iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus sales.It's likely that Apple will ship a similar number of iPhone   models during fiscal year 2017.With that context in mind, 100 million OLED displays for a   special, ultra-premium iPhone planned for sale throughout fiscal   year 2018 seems quite significant.How many curved OLED iPhone models is Apple planning to   sell?Let's assume Bloomberg's sources are good and Apple has   ordered 100 million curved OLED displays in support of its iPhone   build plans for fiscal year 2018.Next, let's assume that 75% of them ultimately wind up on   iPhone models that ship to customers. The reason that I don't say   100% is that even if that 100-million-unit order is for 100   million displays that meet specification, they might ultimately   wind up on iPhones that don't quite pass muster.That's still 75 million iPhone models, or more than 35% of the   total iPhone units that Apple shipped in fiscal year 2016.This suggests that Apple is expecting a large portion of   iPhone buyers next year to opt for the curved OLED model.   Although some sales of the curved OLED model are likely to go to   individuals who would have otherwise purchased ""standard""   4.7-inch or 5.5-inch LCD-equipped models, I wouldn't be surprised   if a good portion of those sales were incremental to what Apple   would have shipped without the introduction of the OLED   version.In that case, Apple would not only enjoy significant   year-over-year iPhone unit growth, but it could see substantial   iPhone average selling price growth as well since any   cannibalization of iPhone 8/iPhone 8 Plus by iPhone 8 OLED is   likely going to result in more revenue for Apple.Fiscal year 2018 should be a good one for AppleBased on the analysis above, it's hard not to get excited for   what could be in store for Apple during its fiscal year 2018. The   potential for Apple to see significant growth in iPhone units and   average selling price is hard to ignore.Should those factors begin to materialize (investors should   have a good idea if it will or not once the company issues   financial guidance for the first quarter of that year), the stock   could be poised for significant earnings multiple expansion as   investors gain confidence thatApple's extremely important iPhone businesshasn't yet topped out.An expansion in Apple's earnings multiple coupled with renewed   profit growth could mean thatApple stockhas a lot of room to run from current levels.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Puts the Sword to iPhone Issues;11/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) would much rather you think about the iPhone 7. However, the company has been busy over the past several days tidying up some issues relating to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s.AAPL announced two repair programs - one dealing with the infamous Touch Disease issue - and has apparently tracked down the cause of a flurry of iPhone 6 phones dying in China.makeArticleAd();Source:Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified)In most cases, getting those iPhone 6 series phones fixed is going to cost you. And China? That's shaping up to be a problem.iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease RepairOn Friday, AAPL finally admitted to the existence ofTouch Disease- the name given to an issue affecting a significant number of iPhone 6 Plus phones. The affected iPhones suffered flickering displays before ultimately refusing to respond to touch control. Third-party investigators placed the blame on a design flaw that allowed the large iPhone's logic board to flex, eventually breaking critical circuitry.""Apple's newMulti-Touch Repair Programaddresses this issue. However, the company puts the blame squarely on users, saying: ""Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.""As a result, the Touch Disease repair will set owners of affected iPhone 6 Plus phones back $149.iPhone 6s Battery ReplacementOn the weekend, AAPL also announced arepair program for iPhone 6s phonesthat were unexpectedly shutting down. The company blames this one on a battery defect specific to phones manufactured between September and October 2015.Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhones Be Made in the     USA?Owners of an iPhone 6s that repeatedly shuts down without warning can bring their phone to an Apple store and if is determined to an affected model, they get a battery replacement for free. AAPL does note that if an affected iPhone 6s is suffering any other damage such as a cracked screen, that damage has to be repaired first - which is likely to result in a fee - before it will install that free battery.China's Dead iPhone 6 ProblemAnother iPhone 6 problem has slowly been gathering steam, this time in China. There have been a growing number of complaints that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s would report a 50% battery level, then unexpectedly shut down.Even more alarmingly, some of these affected devices would then refuse to power on altogether.With AAPL facing declining iPhone sales in a country that it has looked to for growth, the potential for a fatal design flaw was alarming. The odd thing is the fact that the issue seemed limited to China. It was not Touch Disease and the number of iPhones involved seems to fall outside the very limited run of iPhone 6s phones identified under the new battery replacement program.AppleInsiderreported today that a preliminary investigation is pointing to cheap third party power adapters sold in China as being the culprit. Its sources said that ""exactly 100%"" of the affected iPhones that have been examined to datewere primarily charged using non-Apple chargers.The report also claims that these knock-off chargers (whichApple has repeatedly warned against usingfor years) physically damage the charging circuits on the iPhone itself, so a battery replacement isn't a cure. The entire motherboard needs to be replaced.That leaves owners facing an out-of-warranty repair in the $299 range.Impact on AppleWhile it's not as bad as the negative press and massive recall costs rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has faced with its Galaxy Note 7, the iPhone 6 issues aren't helping Apple's image. Touch Disease in particular has tarnished the company's design reputation and comes on top of complaints about the new MacBook Pro missing the mark.Apple Inc. The Perfect Stock For Uncertain     Times (AAPL)If AAPL can escape without the iPhone 7 suffering any critical flaws, then rally with the iPhone 8, any PR damage caused by the iPhone 6 generation should be forgotten.The bigger problem is likely to be China. If you're AAPL, what do you do for owners who have essentially killed their iPhone 6 with a non-approved, third-party charger that you specifically warned against? At $299 for a repair, they're just as likely to buy a next-generation phone fromHuaweiinstead, further eroding market share. Replacing the phone for free means a big hit. And with so many of these chargers circulating (they can cost 50-cents compared to the $19 Apple charges), any replacement program is liable to be massive and doesn't address the root issue of the knock-off chargers.With theChinese Consumer Association officially involved, Apple is under pressure to dosomething. The questions are: What, how much will it cost the company and will it help or further erode iPhone sales in China?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldApple Inc.'s (AAPL) Plan to Win TV: Half-Price     Fees for Subscription Video AppsApple Inc.

NVIDIA Corporation's Biggest Business Surged 63% Last Quarter;11/20/2016;"Last quarter, graphics processing unit (GPU) specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered what could only be described as a ""blowout"" quarter. Overall revenue surged 54%, largely driven by   eye-popping growth across three of its four major growth   businesses (gaming, automotive, and data centers).Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Perhaps the most impressive thing about the report was that   NVIDIA's gaming business -- the company's largest one by far --   grew from $761 million to $1.244 billion in the most recent   quarter.Let's take a closer look at what NVIDIA management had to say   about this performance on its most recent quarterly earnings   call.Lots of demandNVIDIA CFO Colette Kress said this demand was ""fueled by   [NVIDIA's] Pascal-based GPUs."" These GPUs are sold either as part   of add-in-boards for desktop computers or integrated into   notebook computers designed specifically for gaming   applications.NVIDIA first introduced Pascal-based gaming graphics   processors back in May, replacing chips based on its   prior-generation graphics architecture known as Maxwell.""Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop   and notebook [personal computers], and across the full gaming   audience, from GTX 1050 to Titan X,"" Kress continued.For reference, the GeForce GTX 1050 is NVIDIA's entry-level   gaming-oriented graphics processor that begins at $109, while the   Titan X is NVIDIA's highest-end gaming product, priced at   $1,200.Kress also said sales of graphics processors aimed at notebook   computers ""recorded significant gains."" This was likely driven in   no small part by the fact that NVIDIA's latest gaming notebook   chips arenearly identicalto their desktop counterparts. In the past, NVIDIA's gaming   notebook graphics processors offered noticeably less performance   than the desktop versions.Still ramping Pascal architecture productsOn the call, analyst Stephen Chin asked CEO Jen-Hsun Huang if   he ""had any thoughts on whether or not there's still a big gap   between the ramp-up of Pascal supply and the pent-up demand for   those new products.""""In terms of Pascal, we are still ramping,"" Huang began.   ""Production is fully ramped in the sense that all of our products   are fully qualified, they're on the market, they have been   certified and qualified with [original equipment   manufacturers].""He went on to add that ""demand is fairly high"" and that NVIDIA   will ""continue to work hard,"" presumably to meet that demand.Additionally, Huang praised NVIDIA's main manufacturing   partner for the Pascal-based gaming processors,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) , saying that manufacturing yields are ""fantastic""   and that the Taiwan-based chip manufacturer is ""doing a fantastic   job supporting [NVIDIA].""It's worth noting that although TSMC builds most of NVIDIA's   Pascal-based products (GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, GTX Titan X,   and Tegra),Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) was confirmed to be building the GP107 chip   that powers the entry-level GeForce GTX 1050 and GeForce GTX 1050   Ti products.One more thingAlthough the bulk of NVIDIA's gaming revenues come from sales   of stand-alone graphics processors for gaming-oriented personal   computers, NVIDIA is now back in the game console chip business   with theNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Switch.Interestingly, Huang said ""Nintendo contributed a fair amount""   to the growth NVIDIA's gaming business saw last quarter.That said, NVIDIA's overall Tegra processor business brought   in $241 million last quarter (and much of that is likely from   sales into automotive applications, a segment that grew 61% for   the graphics specialist last quarter). So, it's fair to say that   most of the year-over-year gaming growth that NVIDIA enjoyed last   quarter was due to gaming-oriented graphics processors.Investment takeawayGiven the size and maturity of NVIDIA's gaming business,   seeing 60%-plus year-over-year growth rates is incredibly   impressive. Per Huang, the revenue growth in this segment has   been driven by both unit growth as well as average selling price   growth.I don't think NVIDIA will be able to sustain such incredible   growth rates in this business going forward, but if this business   can grow at a 15%-20% annual pace over the next several years,   that would not only be impressive, but it could drive significant   profit expansion for the graphics specialist.Forget the 2016 election and find out why Nvidia is one     of the 10 best stocks to buy nowDonald Trump is the new president, and you're naturally     wondering how best to protect your portfolio and profit in the     process.

Tech's 4 Dumbest CEO Moves of 2016;11/19/2016;"Becoming the CEO of a major technology company takes an   incredible amount of skill, hard work, and a bit of luck. You   don't get to the big chair without doing a lot of things right.   Still, even the best and smartest chief executives sometimes make   mistakes.Steve Jobs had theNewton, Steve Ballmer had theZune, and Steve Case thought the wholeAOL/Time Warner mergerwas a great idea. Sometimes these errors amount to a forgivable   oops -- like the Newton, which you can argue led eventually to   the iPad and iPhone. At other times, one big blunder can end a   career.A number of technology CEOs made dumb moves in 2016. Some will   survive them -- and have a good story to tell -- while others   will lose their job.makeArticleAd();Perhaps don't threaten to assassinate anyonePacketSled, a cybersecurity start-up based in San Diego, may   not be the biggest or best-known technology company, but its   now-former CEO Matt Harrigan did something so dumb, it had to   lead this list. Harrigan made comments on social media calling   for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump. He quickly   deleted the remarks, but the damage was done as his post was   copied to a variety of social media sites. The company responded   quickly, posting on itswebsite:PacketSled takes recent comments made by our CEO seriously.     Once we were made aware of these comments, we immediately     reported this information to the Secret Service and will     cooperate fully with any inquiries.Harrigan was originally placed on administrative leave, but he   quickly offered his resignation, which the company accepted.Samsung Electronics CEO was slow in dealing with his company's   exploding phone problems. Image source:K rlis Dambr ns, Flickr.Samsung waited on the Galaxy 7 noteSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Electronics Chief Executive Kwon Oh-hyun may   not have been responsible for the Galaxy Note 7's propensity to   blow up, but he carries some of the responsibility for how the   company responded to it. In early September, when the companyadmittedthat it was aware of 35 cases of exploding phones, it did not   immediately initiate a total recall. That proved to be a   disastrous choice for the brand, but even a month later, when the   companyhaltedsales and exchanges of the device, it did not issue a full   recall.The completerecallwas not issued until Oct. 13, more than a month after the problem   became evident, but Oh-hyun appears to be getting a pass on   mishandling the matter. Perhaps it's because Samsung has   significant goodwill built up, or maybe it's because Oh-hyun   is not a public figure in the United States. It's harder for the   public and shareholders to call for the head of someone they   don't know.For his part, the CEO seemed confident in his company's   ability to move past the crisis. He called on his employees to   take steps to avoid any future problems,Fortunereported.""We have a long history of overcoming crises,"" Kwon said. ""Let   us use this crisis as a chance to make another leap by   reexamining and thoroughly improving how we work, how we think   about innovation and our perspective of our customers.""Follow the rulesZenefits, a technology company trying to shake up the health   insurance brokerage industry, saw its founder and CEO Parker   Conrad forced to resign after it was discovered that the company   was cutting corners to deliver its stunning growth. A series of   stories byBuzzFeed Newsrevealed that the company employed unlicensed brokers to   sell insurance to customers -- revelations that resulted in   scrutiny from regulators and the undoing of many of its   sales.""The fact is that many of our internal processes, controls and   actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some   decisions have just been plain wrong,"" new CEO and former   COO David Sacks wrote in a memo published byThe New York Times. ""As a result, Parker has resigned.""Basically, Conrad's mistake was allowing his company to break   the rules to hit the numbers that fuel its ""incredible growth""   narrative. That approach not only cost him his job (and maybe his   reputation), it hurts the company going forward, perhaps to a   point it can't recover from.This mistake may have changed historyDuring the run-up to the 2016 United States election,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) was filled with fake news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has   been clear that he does not believe this is a big deal, calling   it ""a pretty crazy idea"" that ""fake news on Facebook, which   is a very small amount of content, influenced the election in any   way,""The New York Timesreported.Facebook employees, at least some of them, do not agree with   their boss. A group of them have formed an unofficial task force   to examine the role their company played in promoting fake news   during the election cycle,BuzzFeed Newsreported.""It's not a crazy idea,"" an unnamed Facebook employee told   BuzzFeed News. ""What's crazy is for him to come out and dismiss   it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know,   that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire   campaign season.""Zuckerberg's decision to ignore this before the election (and   dismissing it afterward) won't cost him his job, nor will it   really have any personal consequences for him, beyond upsetting   some of his employees. It's possible, however, that ignoring this   issue changed the course of the election, American history, and   perhaps all of our futures. That's a whoopsie at least as bad as   the Newton, and maybe one that in retrospect will look worse (or   better) in years to come than it does now.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Samsung Takes a Big Hit in the Smartphone Market;11/18/2016;"This device has been a nonstop headache for Samsung. Image   source: Samsung.South Korean conglomerateSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) already reported that third-quarter earnings   took a massive hit following the global recall and subsequent   discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7. Operating profit in the   company's all-important mobile division got crushed, falling an   astounding 98% sequentially in the third quarter. For context,   mobile operating profits comprised overhalfof total operating profit in the second quarter. So it's a pretty   important business for Samsung.makeArticleAd();But Samsung does not disclose unit volumes, so investors have   to rely on third-party estimates. Market researcherGartnerhas put out its latest estimates on the smartphone market in the   third quarter, and Samsung expectedly took a big hit in the wake   of the Note 7 crisis.Survey saysSamsung remains the No. 1 vendor, a title it has long enjoyed   by a healthy margin in terms of unit volumes.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) saw some minor slipping, too, and Chinese original   equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are really driving growth these   days. Here are the top five players:VendorQ3 2015 UnitsQ3 2016 UnitsChange (YOY)Samsung83.6 million71.7 million(14%)Apple46.1 million43 million(7%)Huawei27.4 million32.5 million19%Oppo11.9 million24.9 million110%BBK10.4 million19.9 million90%Data source: Gartner.The combined market share of Huawei, Oppo, and BBK was about   21%, and those companies' strong performance helped the overall   market grow by 5% to 373 million units. Samsung's 14% decline   represented the company's worst performance ever, even worse than   the 12% decline it saw in Q3 2014. The company's brand has been   significantly tarnished by the Note 7, and it has a lot of work   ahead of it to rebuild consumer trust. A successful Galaxy S8   launch will be critical to redeem itself.Apple continues to lose unit share, and its 11.5% market share   is the lowest since early 2009, according to Gartner's figures.   The researcher believes that units dropped 8.5% in the U.S. and a   gut-wrenching 31% in China during the third quarter. Those are   Apple's most important markets by far, combined representing   nearly 60% of sales last quarter.If you're wondering why Gartner's estimate of 43 million   differs from the 45.5 million iPhones that Apple officially   reported, that's because Gartner measures sales to end users   while Apple (and most companies) report based on channel sell-in.   At the end of the third quarter, Apple had just launched the   iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and was working to increase channel   inventory. Gartner does not believe that the iPhone 7 is doing a   lot to spur upgrades, either.10 stocks we like better than SamsungWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Did Samsung Buy Harman to Counter Apple and Google's IoT Ambitions?;11/17/2016;"Samsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recently agreed  to buyHarman International Industries(NYSE: HAR) for about $8 billion to expand its presence in   connected and automotive electronics. Harman, a market leader in   connected car solutions, supplies over 30 million vehicles with   infotainment, telematics, safety, and security solutions.Image source: Harman.makeArticleAd();About 65% of Harman's $7 billion in revenues last year came   from the automotive market, and its backlog orders hit $24   billion at the end of June. Samsung CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon claimed that   the acquisition ""perfectly complements Samsung in terms of   technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a   natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been   pursuing for some time.""Merging Harman's automotive businesses with Samsung's mobile   and smart appliances businesses would make the tech giant a force   to be reckoned with in the Internet of Things (IoT) market -- and   that could spell trouble for companies likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.Why Samsung needed HarmanSamsung is the  world's biggest manufacturer of   smartphones and consumer electronics. The company's biggest   weakness is its dependence on  mobile devices, which   accounted for 46% of its top line last quarter. That business has   been shrinking due to commoditization and its costly Note 7   blunder.To diversify away from that market, Samsung launched new   wearable devices and smart appliances to expand its software   ecosystem, and  acquired smart home company SmartThings two   years ago. To reduce its dependence on Google Android, Samsung   launched its own OS, Tizen, for wearables and select   smartphones.Image source: SmartThings.With those products in place, Samsung carved out a decent moat   against rival ecosystems like Apple's HomeKit and Google's   Home/Nest. But one area where it lagged behind was the auto   market. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto took over   dashboards with theirmirroring features, but Samsung users were stuck with MirrorLink, a clumsier   protocol which is also used bySonyandHTCdevices.But by acquiring Harman, Samsung instantly becomes a Tier 1   auto supplier, and it will generate cost-cutting synergies by   vertically integrating its processor and display businesses.   Furthermore, Harman's future products will be built with   Samsung's ecosystem integration in mind -- which should work more   smoothly than products that are merely ""compatible"" with Apple   and Google's mobile and IoT devices.How Samsung counters Apple and GoogleSimply put, a person who owns a Samsung phone,   Samsung/SmartThings smart appliances, and a Harman-equipped car   could easily have their personal data synchronized across all   three ""hubs."" This is the kind  of ""ubiquitous computing""   Google has talked about for years, and the kind of game-changing   expansion Apple needs to diversify away from its core hardware   devices.Neither Google nor Apple can compete against Samsung's   dominant position in first-party consumer electronics like smart   TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines. Both companies need   third-party appliance makers to make their devices compatible   with Home or HomeKit for them to sync to their mobile apps. That   strategy is a fairly safe one, since Google and Apple merely   leverage their leading positions in mobile devices to expand   their IoT ecosystems without shouldering the costs of   manufacturing new hardware.However, that strategy also relies on those partners making   reliable appliances which work correctly with their smart home   ecosystems. The same issues could affect cars which don't sync   correctly with iOS and Android devices.Why Google and Apple shouldn't worry... yetSamsung's game plan sounds ambitious, but it could be bogged   down by technical issues. Samsung's SmartThings platform was   plagued with glitches earlier this year, and researchers claimed   that the  platform was poorly protected from malicious   hacks. The recentMirai botnet attack, which used hijacked IoT devices like routers and IP cameras to   knock major websites offline, could also discourage consumers to   connect everything to the internet.Samsung's previous attempts to carve out its own non-Google   ecosystem -- like Tizen, S Health, Milk Music, and the Galaxy   Apps Store -- also haven't been very effective. Instead, each   attempt merely revealed that the majority of Samsung owners   preferred using Google's services.Samsung might now have the leverage in mobile hardware,   consumer electronics, and connected cars to start building a   cohesive IoT ecosystem, but Google and Apple's clout in mobile   operating systems will likely counter that push by simply   convincing hardware makers to tether their products to their   Android and iOS-based apps. Therefore, Samsung's purchase of   Harman was a smart move which will give it a growing automotive   parts business, but it probably won't enable it to topple Google,   Apple, and others in the growing smart home/car market just   yet.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than     SamsungDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Samsung;11/17/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Though they share the same market,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) have little else in common.makeArticleAd();In addition to the memory chip market, in which they compete   head-to-head, Korean electronics powerhouse Samsung also touches   virtually every corner of the consumer electronics market. At the   other end of the spectrum, Micron Technology manufactures and   sells memory chips and nothing else.Concentration has made Micron a classic boom-and-bust stock,   while Samsung's diversification and size provide investors   shelter in times of falling chip prices. But Samsung lacks   Micron's upside potential when things are flush. Given their   apples-to-oranges nature, let's compare Samsung and Micron across   a few important investment criteria to see which represents the   better buy today.Financial fortitudeAs longtime followers of Micron will attest, the market for   memory chips, particularly the commoditized DRAM market, is   fertile ground for boom-and-bust cycles. In this area, having the   financial flexibility to withstand an unexpected swing in memory   chip prices is critically important. Here's how Samsung and   Micron compare in terms of their liquidity and leverage   measures.CompanyCashDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioSamsung$71.4 billion$11.1 billion$12.3 billion2.62Micron Technology$4.4 billion$9.1 billion$3.2 billion1.96Samsung data is in U.S. dollars. Data sources: Samsung, Micron   Technologies, and Yahoo! Finance.Though Micron doesn't necessarily look to be in terrible   near-term shape, Samsung stands head and shoulders above its   memory chip rival in terms of its financial flexibility. To be   fair, though, that shouldn't come as a surprise. Samsung   manufactures and sells a dizzying array of products, ranging from   smartphones to oven range hoods. This gives Samsung tremendous   economies of scale versus the diminutive Micron.At the same time, Micron's ability to finance its operations   doesn't look especially precarious as we see from its quick ratio   of nearly 2. Micron's overall debt burden, though, does appear   alarmingly high. In fact, Micron flags that ""debt obligations   could adversely affect our financial condition"" as a risk factor   in its SEC filings. Even if Micron appears to be using its   leverage for productive purposes, there's little doubt that   Samsung easily wins the financial comparison between the two by a   landslide.Winner: Samsung.Durable competitive advantagesWith roughly 60% of its sales coming from dynamic   random-access memory chips, or DRAM, Micron's financial   performance tends to ebb and flow with the condition of the   broader memory market. Especially given the products'   commoditized nature, it shouldn't come as an overwhelming   surprise that Micron more or less lacks a meaningful economic   moat. Micron's share-price performance in 2016 speaks to this   dynamic.MUdata byYCharts.You'll notice that the first half of 2016 looked fairly bleak   for Micron. Its stock traded down sharply as DRAM prices   softened, prompting media outlets to warn that matters will only   grow worse. However, owing to a number of factors, DRAM prices   didn't crater as many expected, which helped trigger Micron   stock's impressive rally in the second half.The point here, though, is that Micron largely succeeds or   fails based on the whims of the market in which it operates. The   same cannot be said for Samsung, whose product diversification   has a protective effect, as was already mentioned earlier in this   article. At the end of the day, there's simply no comparison   between the staying power of these two companies. If this were a   boxing match, Samsung takes this round in a first-round TKO.Winner: Samsung.ValuationAgain, the differences in quality manifest themselves when the   companies' valuations are compared. Here's how Micron and Samsung   stack up across several of the most commonly used valuation   metrics.Company NameP/E RatioForward P/E ratioEV/EBITDASamsung11.313.42.9Micron Technology(66)11.17.4EV = Enterprise value. EBITDA = Earnings before interest,   taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Data source: Yahoo!   Finance, except for forward P/E ratios, which are retrieved from   Morningstar.After losing money in 2015, Micron remains unprofitable on a   trailing-12-months basis, which explains its negative current P/E   ratio. It's worth noting that Samsung's bottom-barrel valuation   likely isn't the result of an oversight by Mr. Market. Though it   often trades at something of a discount to the broader market,   Samsung's valuation likely speaks to the expected negative impact   the Galaxy Note 7 recall will have on Samsung's bottom line. The   company recently revised down its guidance and informed investors   that the mass recall should cost it over $3 billion in the next   two quarters.However, this negative story line will eventually fade into   memory. When it does, things will be back to business as usual   for Samsung, whereas it remains anyone's guess where Micron will   end up in the coming quarters. Looking at each company's   valuation through the context of its longer-term business   prospects, Samsung also enjoys the more compelling valuation   today.Winner: Samsung.And the winner is...Sweeping all three categories, Samsung clearly stands as the   more sustainable stock pick for investors looking to buy and hold   for the long term. To be clear, this doesn't mean that Micron   cannot succeed. In fact, a sustained period of strong DRAM prices   could send Micron shares to the Moon. However, it's anyone's   guess whether that will happen. All things considered, Samsung is   the higher-quality company and the better buy today between these   two memory chip rivals.10 stocks we like better than SamsungWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) Plan to Win TV: Half-Price Fees for Subscription Video Apps;11/17/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed to deliver the subscription TV bundle that has been rumored for the past year … but that doesn't mean it has given up on taking over your television. Step one was last year's new Apple TV streaming box and step two was the new TV app unveiled at its October MacBook Pro event.Source: AppleAnd now we know step three - or at leastBloombergdoes- and that's to discount the App Store fee paid by subscription video apps by 50%.makeArticleAd();Cutting App Store Fees to Boost Video App ParticipationThe App Store is a significant revenue generator for AAPL. For 2015, the company was estimated to have reaped over $6 billion in revenue, on total App Store sales of over $20 billion. The exact numbers aren't known because Apple folds those App Store numbers into its Services division, but based on apress release from the companytouting the $20 billion-plus revenue last year and a 30% cut of revenue, that's what the math says.However, according to a report fromBloomberg, AAPL is planning tohalve that royalty rate for video subscription apps. At least, it will for those that agree to integration in Apple's own new TV app, which made its public debut on stage atOctober's big Apple event.The New TV App is Key to the Discount, But…According toBloomberg, Apple's newTV appis key to getting that 50% royalty discount. If a video subscription service does not integrate with the app - which AAPL is positioning as a hub for video viewing across iOS devices including the Apple TV - it continues to pay a 30% cut on all its earnings.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10Play ball with Apple and that gets cut to 15%. That seems like a win for content providers. But there's a catch.By positioning its new TV app as the single video viewing hub for a customer, Apple is putting itself in the driver's seat when it comes to related data and content curation.For example,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) knows an awful lot about its subscribers, particularly their viewing habits. This data can be very valuable - it can be used for everything from targeting new content to negotiating licensing fees with movie studios - but even when using the current Netflix app on an Apple TV or iPhone, it remains proprietary to Netflix. The same thing with content curation. Netflix can engage customers by recommending content based on data it's collected about their viewing habits.Move Netflix to within the new TV app and now Apple is also tracking that information. However, it has the advantage of tracking the info across multiple video services, making it evenmorevaluable. Or potentially helping Apple with any ambitions about developing its own - competing - original programming in the future.And, AAPL can also make recommendations based on viewing habits, but those suggestions might point to content from a service other than Netflix.Apple TV Needs Netflix in the New TV AppApple's new TV app has the potential to make the Apple TV a much more compelling streaming box. Tracking viewing data across iOS devices, so a user can catch part of a movie at the gym on their iPhone, then automatically pick up where they left off when they sit in front of their TV, is pretty slick.

Can GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Bounce Back After the Karma Fiasco?;11/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) stock has been badly hammered following news that the company was recalling the Karma drone. This came in the wake of another heavy post-earnings selloff a few days prior, leading to GPRO stock losing 27% of its value in the space of a month.Source: GoProGoPro stock announced that it had issued arecall of about 2,500 devicesthat had been sold since Karma was launched on Oct. 23 due to reports about the drones losing power while in use. The company said that it won't offer exchanges but will instead provide a full refund once the owners return their gadgets.makeArticleAd();GPRO stock is now down 45% year to date and has lost roughly half its value over the past 12 months.Is GoPro's Management Floundering?The Karma recall did not go down well with investors, since it came hot on the heels of another report that pointed to serious execution issues. GoPro has been pushing back shipment dates for the Karma, which doesn't look good considering that the company had earlier pushed the launch date from May to September. This points to possible production or supply issues which in turn could potentially hurt traditionally hot holiday sales.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10GoPro issued lower-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter, saying it expects revenue of $625 million and EPS of 30 cents against Wall Street's expectations of revenue of $666.1 million and EPS of 44 cents.Whereas this could be the company's way of reining in on investor expectations after another weak quarter, it could be grounded in reality since GoPro has missed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters.The Bullish Stance for GPRO StockGoPro has been rather economical with details regarding the Karma delay.On one hand, investors can hope that the delay is being caused by a temporary shortage of components rather than any major issues along the supply chain. After all, GoPro is not the only drone manufacturer that's facing delays here.DJI, manufacturer of the Phantom drone, has pushed back shipment date for the Mavic Pro from mid-October to a ""within November"" timeframe.According to DJI's management, the delay is being caused by""amazingly strong global demand.""Whereas the ""strong demand"" theme might not necessarily apply to Karma, there's reason to remain cautiously optimistic.After all GoPro could merely be trying to limit availability of the drone to avoid a repeat of the Hero 4 Session fiasco. GPRO stock was forced to offer hefty discounts for the camera in a bid to get rid of excessive inventory levels and poor sell-through. If something similar happened to Karma, GoPro's image would be left in shreds.Reality CheckBut that kind of bullishness melts into thin air when you consider the issues currently plaguing GoPro, including the Karma recall. For GPRO stock to have issued a recall of its much-awaited drone and risk damaging its reputation suggests that the defect rate in the product must have been quite high. That's a direct indictment on the company's design team and manufacturer(s).We cannot overlook GoPro stock's less-than-stellar execution track record. The company has flubbed several high-profile product launches in the past that put a damper on its ability to execute.For instance, CEO Nick Woodman told investors back in May that he was not aware that Karma would be delayed right up until a week before the first quarter conference call. That clearly suggests that management was blindsided by events.Further, the company repeatedly delayed the launch of its mainstream stand-alone 360-degree camera by months, thereby giving devices such asSamsung's (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Gear 360 a nice head-start. The same goes for the 16-camera Odyssey rig which the company jointly developed withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), only to start shipping a full year after its introduction.One Reason to Be Long-Term BullishThat's the kind of uncertainty that the market hates, which is likely to continue taking a toll on GPRO stock. Right now it's rather difficult to find any positive catalyst for GPRO stock except one - the company's 2017 guidance.When This Analyst Slams Chipotle Mexican Grill,     Inc. (CMG), You Should ListenGoPro issued upbeat 2017 guidance, saying it expects double-digit revenue growth and a GAAP net profit. If those predictions turn out to be true, it will mark the first time the company recorded growth and returned to the black in five quarters. GoPro says that its main focus next year will be to cut costs in a bid to maintain profitability. Investors should use the fourth quarter to check how well the company performs on that score.If GoPro manages to return to growth and profitability in 2017, you can expect GPRO stock to soar to new highs.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Best Investments for 2017The 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2017The postCan GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Bounce Back After the Karma Fiasco?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons HP Inc Stock Is Up 35% In 2016;11/16/2016;"Despite being in the ""wrong"" industry, and analysts relatively   blasé attitude,HP(NYSE: HPQ) stock has quietly gone about delivering a 35% return   in 2016. Combined with its stellar 3.3% dividend yield, HP has   been a growth and income investors dream. So, why aren't analysts   in HP's corner?The waning PC market and HP's poor printing division results   are the reasons for its consensus price target of a mere   $16.27 a share. But there are actually several good reasons HP   has delivered so well in 2016, and is likely to continue doing so   well into the future.makeArticleAd();Image source:HP.Back to the basicsThe current HP could be the poster child for the old adage,   ""There's more than one way to skin a cat."" Unlike many companies   in the tech sector, HP doesn't sacrifice its bottom line to buy   its way into quarterly revenue growth.HP delivered significant earnings-per-share (EPS) growth   compared to the year-ago third quarter despite a 4% drop in   revenue to $11.9 billion. The company accomplished that by   shaving nearly $600 million in expenses, and a whopping $3.24   billion year to date. And with its workforce reduction under way,   CEO Dion Weisler intends to make HP even leaner and more focused   on its core competencies.The benefits of HP's strict expense management have improved   margins -- a full two percentage points higher than 2015's 7.4%   after removing one-time items -- which in turn boosted its   operating earnings 28% this year to $800 million. The result was   a 37% year-over-year improvement in EPS to $0.48. Not bad   considering its quarterly revenue decline.Turning lemons into lemonadeThe biggest piece of the HP revenue pie is its PC division,   which is performing well above expectations. However, HP's   printing unit is another matter, dropping 14% year over year to   $4.4 billion. Of HP's highest revenue divisions, supply sales   really took a hit last quarter, dropping 18% to $2.84 billion.   But help is on the way.Weisler made it clear with the $1.05 billion deal forSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printing operations that HP wasn't going to   sit idly by as print sales faltered. In addition to one of the   industry's top line-up's of multifunction printing (MFP)   technology and ""more than 6,500 printing patents and a   world-class workforce,"" the deal also includes Samsung's print   supplies segment. Samsung doesn't break out print sales, but one   pundit's estimate suggests it generated about $1 billion to $1.6   billion last year.As noted in a recentarticle, there's also the not-so-small matter of HP's 3D printing   opportunity. There are billions of dollars at stake in 3D   printing, primarily in the manufacturing sector, which accounted   for over $5 billion in sales a year ago. HP's new Fusion 3D   printers are just hitting the streets, and according to one   analyst some customers have been waiting for the new alternatives   before investing in a competitor's device.How'd they do that?Contrary to the headlines, the PC market isn't quite dead: at   least not for HP. Overall, global PC shipments dropped 5.7% in   the calendar third quarter. However, HP's strategy of targeting   niche markets such as its virtual reality (VR) ready OMEN   notebook helped it drive a 2.3% increase year over year to 14   million units and increase its market share to 20.4%. That's just   a whisker behind industry leaderLenovo's 20.9% share.Mobile PC shipments, which includes HP's notebook line-up,   actually increased worldwide last quarter in the ""low   single-digit"" range. But HP's notebook sales climbed 8% in the   third quarter to $4.3 billion, making it HP's largest and fastest   growing division. In other words, Weisler's efforts to target   niche opportunities like gaming have helped HP handily outpace   the market, and many investor's expectations.HP is lean and getting leaner, the Samsung deal and 3D   printing should kick-start print sales, and PCs are a   surprisingly strong revenue driver. Add it all up and, if growth   and income are on your watch list, HP still warrants a good look   -- even with its stellar performance in 2016.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better       than HPDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is       up.

Meanwhile, a slight rebound in theprice of   goldhelped the highly leveragedDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT)  rise by 3%.As for individual stocks,Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) andHarman International(NYSE: HAR) both enjoyed market-thumping gains to start off the   trading week.Bank of America's new highBank of America surged 6% to a new high as investors continue   to bet that a Trump administrationwill be good for the nation's biggest banks. The stock is now up 17% in the four trading days since Donald   Trump captured the White House.Economic forecasts are ticking higher in response to the   belief that the new administration will prioritize major stimulus   spending through infrastructure projects and tax cuts. Economists   polled by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend, for example,   said the economy could growth by 2.2% next year and by 2.3% in   2018, compared to their prior 1.5% projections. A faster-growing   economy would theoretically spark increased loan demand and push   Bank of America's profits up .While any spending project or tax cut plan is completely   hypothetical at this point, there's no denying that interest   rates are moving in Bank of America's favor. For every full   percentage point increase on long term interest rates, Bank of   America's management estimates that the company will earn over $5   billion in additional interest income .Harman International's buyoutHarman International, which designs entertainment technology   for automobiles,jumped 25%after agreeing to be purchased bySamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . The deal valued Harman at $112 per share, or   $8 billion, and now gives Samsung a strong presence in this   growing niche. ""Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of   technologies, products, and solutions,"" Samsung CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon   said in a press release .Image source: Getty Images.Harman's management team believes the buyout represents the   best way for shareholders to cash in on the deep expertise that   the company has built around in-car navigation systems, audio   systems, and wireless connectivity. ""Today's announcement is a   testament to what we have achieved and the value that we have   created for shareholders,"" CEO Dinesh Paliwal said.Samsung hopes it can use its expertise in connected mobility   and displays, along with its global distribution platform, to   extend Harman's market leading position. The company also thinks   it can make significant improvements to the user experience in   car infotainment systems that will find healthy demand from   Harman's automotive partners.Assuming the deal progresses as planned, shareholders can   expect to receive their $112 per share in cash when the deal   closes sometime in the middle of next year.10 stocks we like better than Bank of AmericaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Shares of Harman International Industries Jumped Over 25% Today;11/14/2016;"What happenedShares ofHarman International Industries(NYSE: HAR) soared on Monday morning. As of shortly after noon   EST, Harman shares were trading at $109.82, up 25.3% from   Friday's close.So what?Harman announced on Monday morning that it hasagreed to be acquiredby Korean giantSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for $8 billion in cash. That's a 28% premium   over Harman's Friday closing price.Harman owns several premium consumer and professional audio   brands. In recent years, it has build a significant business   supplying ""infotainment"" systems to automakers, becoming a center   of expertise on ""connected car"" technology in the process.makeArticleAd();Harman developed and supplied the touchscreen ""infotainment""   system in this Jaguar sedan. Harman's status as an auto supplier   drew the interest of giant Samsung. Image source: Jaguar Land   Rover.Autos are now the majority of Harman's business: About 65% of   its sales are auto-related. Its partners includeFiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) ,BMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) , and several other automakers, including most   of the premium European brands.That's what drew Samsung's interest. Samsung is a huge player   in consumer electronics, but until recently it hasn't had a   significant presence in autos, where technology is rapidly   transforming the products and industry. Acquiring Harman will   instantly make Samsung a serious contender for new business from   the global automakers.Now what?The deal awaits approval by regulators and Harman   shareholders, but at first look it doesn't seem likely to draw   significant opposition from either.

The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill;11/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwo rumors about upcomingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) product releases show the next target on AAPL's hit list: the display bezel. Analysts are calling for an all-new 10.9-inch iPad in 2017, followed by super-sized iPhone 8 models.Source: AppleAccording to a report from Barclays, all three new Apple devices will lose the display bezel, sporting edge-to-edge displays.makeArticleAd();The bezel is the frame that surrounds the display on a laptop or mobile device. No-one particularly likes looking at a bezel, but for years they have been a necessary design element. The bezel provides structural strength, and on smartphones and tablets it provides a place for manufacturers to incorporate physical buttons.Why the Bezel Gets the AxSo why would Apple want to get rid of the bezel on the iPhone 8 and the new iPad model it's expected to introduce next year?Visual appeal is high on the list, but there is a more practical purpose as well. Get rid of the bezel, and you can fit a larger display in the same size form factor.3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a     Great BuyIn the case of the new MacBook Pro, Apple chose to keep the same 15.4-inch and 13.3-inch Retina displays as previous models. However, the smaller bezel means the overall physical size of the notebooks - their footprint - is smaller. This is a similar tactic to that used byDell.The ""Infinity Display"" in its XPS 13 allows for a laptop that's close in size to an 11-inch notebook.What's Being Said About the iPhone 8 and New iPad ModelMacRumorspublished details of a report released by Barclays research analysts, who cited sources within AAPL's Asian supply chain as their sources.According to the analysts,two new iPhone models will feature bezel-free displays. The iPhone 8 will have edge-to-edge, curved glass displays, free of bezels. The curved edge display is a feature pioneered by rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in its Galaxy Edge phones. Getting rid of bezels altogether on the iPhone 8 will require incorporating the Home button within the display.Apple took the first step toward this with the iPhone 7, which features a solid-state home button, replacing the traditional physical button. So AAPL should have the technical know-how to manage this.We've heard talk of curved displays on the upcoming iPhone before. What's new is the prediction that the bezel-free design will let Apple bump up the size of the new iPhone displays, while keeping them the same physical size as the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 would move from 4.7 inches to 5 inches, while the iPhone 8 Plus would go to 5.8 inches from 5.5 inches.This would be a big win. Consumers like bigger displays - they're easier to read, while games and video look better. But there's a limit to how big a smartphone can be before pocket-ability and usability become issues.The prediction that AAPL wouldrelease three new iPad models in 2017is also not new. However, the Barclays analysts have added a wrinkle by claiming the new 10.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a bezel-free design with an edge-to-edge display. Doing so will let Apple sell a mid-sized iPad that's the same physical size as the iPad Air 2 and 9.7-inch iPad Pro.Apple Rumors: iPad Changes, iBooks App and an     Apple Support AppA new iPad Pro with a larger display that's fashionably bezel-free would appeal to consumers looking for a fresh new design, while offering another option for Apple's increasingly important enterprise buyers.Bottom Line for AAPL2017 hasn't been the most stellar year for Apple product releases. Many long-time fans have complained about the company's choice to eliminate ""outdated"" ports across its model lines. Controversy over the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and the move to all USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro in many ways overshadowed their respective launches.However, if 2017 does indeed turn out to be the year Apple declares war on the bezel, expect to hear cheers instead of boos.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAmazon.com, Inc.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy;11/11/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is lagging the market, and it has been for a couple of years now. That - and Apple's streak of revenue declines - makes one wonder whether AAPL stock will ever really be a growth issue again.Source:via AppleHere's where my mind wanders:makeArticleAd();My 21.5-inch iMac entered its sixth year of service this summer, and it's starting to feel its age. Once upon a time, when I got this bad boy, I was convinced that Apple could do no wrong. I loved to flaunt that in the face of my brother, a staunch Windows enthusiast.Fast forward to today, and like every computer on this planet that gets old, it has slowed to a crawl. I'm now forced to watch that spinning beachball of death tell me my iMac is busy and might never get free.Yes, I realize there are ways of reducing that condition, but a tech nerd I am not. I'm all about business models, sustainable growth and bottom lines. I couldn't tell you the difference between my iMac and one sold in 2013. But what I can tell you is that Apple still has a few tricks up its sleeve when it comes to hanging on to market share.The wily old veteran of the tech biz still is a good play in my opinion. Here are three reasons investors should own AAPL stock.MacBook ProI've been itching to replace my iMac for a couple of years, but every time I think about spending Apple-type money for a new machine, I fondly remember all the good times I've had with my existing desktop. Itch goes away.7 Buys for 7 Donald Trump Fears That Won't Come     TrueI then think about how nice it would be to tap out a 600- to 700-word article in my local coffee shop surrounded by people, not cats, where the energy in the room drives my creativity through the roof. The problem is I only have an iPad Mini, and even with the accessory keyboard you can buy, it hardly seems like the tool used by a so-called professional.However, I do believe a compromise has recently arrived. Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro on Oct. 27.InvestorPlacecontributor Brad Moonhighlighted all the detailsthe very same day. One particular sentence caught my attention:""The new MacBook Pro is significantly thinner, lighter and more powerful than the previous generation.""I'm almost sold.Forbescontributor Ewan Spencehas written a nice pieceabout Apple's latest product launch and its ultimate success. He reasons that MacBook Pro sales in the first two weeks have been significant due to ""pent-up demand"" (his words, not mine) given there's been no real update in the product over the past few years.And here's where Spence makes case for buying AAPL stock:""The consumers who want a solid, dependable, and fast machine… are happily buying the latest MacBook Pro. Whether Apple's sacrifice of its core market [professionals] to reach the masses is worth it will become clear over the next few years. Short- and medium-term prospects look rosy. Long-term will be a question for another day.""I'm one of the masses.AAPL didn't start to do really well until it introduced products such as the iPod and iPhone that leaned toward regular Joes and away from a niche audience. If this is selling out, Apple ought to consider doing it more often.Samsung Has Its Hands FullFirst,Samsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) phones started catching fire - so much so that the conglomerate was forced topermanently discontinue its Note 7 phones, slicing $18 billion off its market cap and likely resulting in almost $3 billion in losses for the company. Then its top-loading washers started exploding, and it was forced to recall2.8 million washing machines.""Customers to Samsung: Get your shit together"" is an actual headline CNET recently used for an article summarizing the level of discontent consumers have for Samsung at the moment. It kind of paints a picture.Why do I mention this?InvestorPlacefeature writer Dan Burrowsdiscussed the ramifications of a Trump presidencythe day after the fateful result, recommending that investors not rush to any conclusions whether you own AAPL stock or are thinking of buying. Good advice. But what really caught my eye was a comment after his article by reader macnificentseven48. I've cut it down to include just the most relevant parts:""Apple stockis a dog. Tim Cook is the only major tech company CEO who can't find some new side business to boost revenue. He thinks selling more iPhones is always the answer. There's simply no good news for Apple on the horizon. I'm glad I'm getting the dividends but the share price continues to stagnate while all the other tech companies' share prices are soaring.""Really.Macnificentseven48, have you looked at the share price of Samsung lately? Maybe you'd like to collect dividends from Samsung instead?Since Tim Cook became CEO on Aug. 24, 2011, AAPL stock has generated a cumulative total return of 100.6%; theTechnology SPDR(NYSEARCA:XLK) over the same period checks in at 390 basis points less or 96.7%.Apple's doing just fine.Apple's Overseas CashTrump's victory has created some renewed buzz around his one-time, 10% repatriation tax that would allow Apple to bring home roughly $194 billion in overseas cash (after-tax) to use for dividends, share repurchases, etc.I've never been a fan of companies piling on debt to repurchase stock because they can't (or more accurately, won't) repatriate overseas cash given the 35% corporate tax rate they'd face as a result. To me, it'sun-American, and I said as much back in 2012.Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually     a Monster HitAAPL generates a ton of free cash, so even if it paid 35% on the $212 billion in overseas cash, it still would have $138 billion to allocate elsewhere, and the U.S. Treasury would have $74 billion additional dollars to help all those poor disenfranchised Donald Trump voters in Ohio and elsewhere.So, why do I view this as a positive?Ultimately, whatever cash comes back to the U.S. is better than none. Further, if it allows Apple to go back to being a debt-free company, all the better for Apple stock holders, because eventually interest rates will go up.Bottom Line on AAPL StockApple's products might not be hitting any home runs these days, but it's a heck of a lot better than having phones and washing machines that are blowing up on customers.For this reason, I believe AAPL stock is still a good play.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of     2016The 10 Best ETFs on the PlanetThe post3 Reasons Apple Inc.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is About to Squeeze iPhone Suppliers;11/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may be facing declining iPhone sales, but two reports show the company is dominating the industry profits and determined to remain in that position.Source: AppleIn the last quarter, AAPL accounted for an astounding 103.6% of all smartphone industry profits. However, determined to maintain its fat margins - and provide a little tailwind for strugglingApple stock- the company also is said to be leaning on its suppliers to cut prices on iPhone components.makeArticleAd();Apple Scoops Virtually Every Cent of Smartphone ProfitsAppleInsiderdetails areport by BMO Capital Market analyst Tim Longon the current state of Apple's iPhone business in relation to the overall smartphone industry. It paints a striking picture of a company that has continued to see its marketshare erode, yet has managed to essentially shut out its rivals when it comes toactually making moneyoff smartphones.It's always been clear from Apple's earnings reports that the iPhone is critical to the company's bottom line. In its last quarter, the iPhone accounted for $28.16 billion in revenue and was the biggest contributor to Apple profit.Those numbers were down significantly compared to a year ago. This reflects the fact iPhone sales have slipped during the same time period. Compared to 13.6% of world smartphone sales in Q3 2015, this year AAPL has captured just 12.1% of the market. Rivals runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android rising to a commanding 87.5%.However, market share doesn't equal profitability, as Tim Long's report shows.5 Best Stocks to Buy After the Presidential     ElectionApple has historically punched far above its weight when it comes to making money from its mobile phones, but in Q3, the company absolutely dominated its rivals. While virtually every other smartphone manufacturer lost money, iPhone sales accounted for 103.6% of industry profits (the greater than 100% number reflecting the losses suffered by the competition).Apple's rival in the smartphone wars,Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), placed second with a mere 0.9% of smartphone profits.The iPhone SE and Apple Profit Boosting StrategyAt roughly the same time the Apple Profit story was breaking,MacRumorspublished a report byKGI Security analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In it, Kuo outlines two of AAPL's strategies for maintaining such high margins on its iPhones.According to Kuo, Apple will skip refreshing the iPhone SE next year. Its smallest and most affordable phone already has sufficient technical specs for it to remain a viable option for another year. If it's good enough to satisfy demand, why spend the money on an upgrade? Having no new iPhone SE saves AAPL on development costs and manufacturing start-up costs.However, Kuo predicts that Apple will go further.In addition to not releasing a new iPhone SE model next year, he thinks the company will lean on its suppliers to cut their prices on iPhone components. Some - like Samsung - will push back, but others will likely cave in an attempt to retain Apple's business.If Apple achieves any success in its efforts to cut production costs, it not only avoids the cost of releasing a new iPhone SE, but it also makes the existing models even more profitable. Even if iPhone sales continue to slide going into 2017 (and the ramp-up to the10th anniversary iPhone 8) as predicted, with better margins, Apple profit won't take as big a hit.And AAPL will continue to dominate smartphone industry profits despite a dwindling market share.Monday Apple Rumors: iPhone 7 May Get 'Jet     White' Color OptionIt's worth noting that part of the reason for Apple's incredible spike last quarter can be attributed to the hit Samsung took over the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. That doesn't take away from the fact that no other other single smartphone manufacturer seems to have anywhere near the same leverage to command the combination of discounted components from suppliersandpremium pricing from consumers.Apple has never been shy about using that clout, and it shows.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Offers a Sneaky, Safer Way to Go Long;11/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsAre you fearful of missing the next bullish move inApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but at the same time aren't convinced AAPL stock has made a   technical low? The good news is there's an Apple options spread   combo that may help with that dilemma. Let me explain.AAPL stock, along with most U.S. equities, enjoyed a nice relief   rally Monday on the back of the FBI confirming for a second time   that Hillary Clinton's email improprieties may have been naughty,   but they're not criminal in nature.makeArticleAd();But will the rally inApple stockcontinue? On the macro level, there's still the actual election.   Could there be a Brexit-like surprise or a coupe within   Congressional system? Then there's the all-important retail   selling season to consider later this month, then December's   FOMC decision, and, and, and….The point is there's a lot of uncertainty facing   investors.What's more, that's not even trying to figure out AAPL stock   based oncompany-specific channel checksorrumors of new productsand the likes, which I personally find difficult at best to keep   track of.7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire       GrowthLastly and not to confuse matters, despite Wall Street saying   it abhors uncertainty, ""climbing a wall of worry"" happens often   enough to support not wanting to get left behind because we're   waiting on some enigmatic RSVP regarding market clarity. So,   what's an AAPL stock trader to do?AAPL Stock Daily ChartSome AAPL stock traders will invariably rely on the price   chart in order to gain clarity. On that note, and not aSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Note 7, mind you, Apple bulls may be optimistic based on a   classic-looking uptrend that's developed since shares hit a   year-to-date low in May. I can't say I blame them.On the other hand, conditions aren't picture perfect in AAPL   stock either. Shares have broken an up-channel support line and   50-day simple moving average in recent days. Both might act as   overhead resistance from roughly $111 - $112.50.If Apple stock does fail, a full-blown reversal to the   downside could find shares on their way to test the bullish   iPhone 7 ""pre-order"" news gap from Sept. 14. That's near $105.50   and would put a 50% retracement in play as well.The good news is if that sort of additional testing does   occur, as an AAPL bull you don't have to suffer the bearish   consequences like a long stock trader if you use Apple options to   your advantage.AAPL Stock Vertical ComboFor bulls who share our concern of AAPL's ability to clear   resistance, don't want to be left out if Apple does rally   strongly, but also want to buy shares on weakness; the Weeklys   Dec 9 $113/$115 bull call and Dec 9 $105/$102 bull put combo is   attractive for a 22 cent debit or better. The small outlay would   be lost at expiration if shares are between $105 and $113.On the upside, the expiration breakeven is $113.22 and   modestly above resistance. However, if Apple rallies 4.1% to $115   or higher, this bullish trader captures $1.78, or more than 800%   in a month.Traders might consider buying two spreads relative to a   100-share purchase of AAPL stock. The profit would still lag   owning shares outright, but with a fraction of the risk if it   cratered.CVS Health Corp (CVS) Stock Is a       Black-and-Blue Buy NowSpeaking of downside risk, if the bull put spread goes   in-the-money this trader is positioned to buy Apple stock on   weakness at $105.22 as shares test technical support. That's   nice.Even nicer, during the life of the spread this trader never   pays more than $2.22 above the going AAPL stock price. Bottom   line, even if shares of Apple tumble far below $102, the   protective put mitigates the damage to a defined amount. Now   that's some good food for thought!Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) Fights Back With Viv Digital Assistant on Galaxy S8;11/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. On Sunday, the company confirmed how it's going to fight back by launching its own digital assistant with the Galaxy S8, Viv.Source: SamsungSamsung announced the acquisition of the next-generation artificial intelligence company,Viv Labs, last month, run by the co-creator ofApple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) own AI voice platform - Siri.makeArticleAd();Viv will take on the competition in 2017, challenging Siri on iPhone 8 and trying to win back customers fromAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Google Pixel smartphone.Viv Aims to Change the Samsung NarrativeSamsung has had a terrible year. Things started out well with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. The Galaxy Note 7 scored excellent initial reviews, but quickly turned into an epic PR nightmare. Exploding Note 7's led to arecall of the devices, and mounting costs thatcould hit $17 billion.Even as this crisis simmered, the company was forced torecall millions of washing machines, amid concerns they could vibrate to the point of shaking themselves apart.3 Pharma Stocks That Could Be Gutted If     Marijuana WinsSo far, all of this mess hasn't crippled the value of Samsung stock, but the cumulative impact is not helping. And it doesn't bode well for the future.Samsung desperately needs a hit to turn the narrative around and it's looking to the Galaxy S8 to do that. According to a report fromReuterson Sunday, the company confirmed that a key feature of its new flagship smartphone will be thelaunch of Viv- its own digital assistant.Viv will take on Apple's Siri and Alphabet's Google Assistant.Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 8 and Google PixelWhen Samsung launched Galaxy S7 early in 2016, the competitive landscape looked favorable for SSNLF. The new flagship smartphone corrected most of the complaints received when the company switched to its new metal and glass design the previous year and was a stunner in looks and performance.With arch-rival Apple switching to a three-year product cycle, the iPhone 7 was expected to be a boring release. The rumored axing of the headphone jack in the new Apple iPhone would cause resentment that could push Apple fans to an alternative. And launching the Galaxy Note 7 phablet in August - just a month before Apple's big iPhone event - would help take any wind out of Apple's sales.The Galaxy Note 7 backfired, however, and at a horrible time.The iPhone 7 generated more excitement than expected, and worse, just as Samsung was struggling with a barrage of negative publicity, Alphabet went and released its own premium smartphone, the Google Pixel.Not only was the Pixel competing directly with Samsung's Galaxy S7, it featured a new Google Assistant that was exclusive and not available to other Android smartphones.The Galaxy Note 7 stink also made consumers leery about buying a Galaxy S7 (although it had never been implicated as having an unstable battery) leadingApple to capture 103.6% of the entire smartphone industry profitsin the last quarter.Then in OctoberSamsung purchased Viv. The strategic move kept Viv from making its way back to Apple, where many had hoped it would be folded into Siri. And now we know the company immediately put the Viv team to work on integration with Galaxy S8.When Samsung's flagship arrives early next year, it will be equipped with its own AI-powered customized personal assistant to take on Siri and Google Assistant, with exclusive Viv integration. 2017 is shaping up to be an epic battle for flagship smartphone market share.Apple will be pulling out all the stops with a 10th anniversary iPhone 8, with a new form factor (rumored to be all-glass). Alphabet will be taking what it learned from Google Pixel and releasing a followup that is certain to be a big improvement over an already excellent debut launch.But all eyes will be on Samsung. The company has to prove the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco is behind it. Galaxy Note 8 not only has to go toe-to-toe with iPhone 8, it also has to prevent Google Pixel from stealing its thunder - and its position as the top-selling premium Android smartphone.The 5 Biggest Risks to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)     StockA new Galaxy S8 equipped with its customized Viv personal assistant will be Samsung's shot at winning back customers and giving Samsung stock a shot in the arm by revitalizing its mobile division's profits.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.

Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Is a Buy Before the Holidays;11/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 1967. And for the last 48 years has grown its dividend every year. That makes TGT a Dividend Aristocrat almost twice over.Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The point here is that TGT is not the kind of stock that will have hockey-stick-shaped price graph. It's a 'slow and steady' foundational stock. You buy this one and check on it every couple of years to see how it's performing.makeArticleAd();It's a solid income pick with some growth wrapped around it. But the income is consistent - around 3.5% nowadays - and the growth is dependent upon broader economic factors.TGT has had a tough time since it missed its earnings numbers for the second quarter. That sent the stock down and it has continued to stay in the red (off 7%) for 2016.The biggest concern regarding Target stock moving forward is, how well it can adapt to online efforts fromWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT) and juggernautAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire     GrowthYou see, the traditional brick-and-mortar business is being eclipsed by online retail and AMZN is the top player in the market. It established its online presence years ago and now has added shopping features beyond its initial book inventory.There are usually much better margins in online retailing since you don't have to pay for stores or the utilities of those stores, as well as the salaries to operate the stores. In recent years, Amazon has scaled up its retail model and linked it to its state-of-the-art logistics to become the No. 1 online retailer.This has been the challenge of big-box stores like Target and Walmart. TGT is well-secured in its mid-priced segment. It offers a more compelling quality-for-price model, whereas WMT is more about price. That means Target has some pricing flexibility, not having to offer the least-expensive goods, but goods withvalue.TGT has also started to make significant inroads into the organic foods business. This is one of the key pivots TGT has made in recent years.Again, this model caters to shoppers willing to pay slightly more to get more perceived value. And it also helps create faster moving items in its large stores.Bottom Line for TGT StockPart of Target's problems this year have been in its restructuring, and that's a lot better than if it wasn't hitting its numbers and had no plans to do something about it. TGT is upping its game on all fronts.It's opening smaller stores that are returning higher margins than WMT. It has begun to shift its focus to more of a 'one-stop shop' by adding healthy groceries. It has beefed up its online presence and is seeing solid growth from it.Target stock is much closer to realizing its sweet spot relative to Walmart and Amazon. And that bodes well moving forward.Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) Fights Back With     Viv Digital Assistant on Galaxy S8Also, don't forget we're entering into the holiday spending season. This will be a true test of how well TGT is modifying its brand.And even if this presidential election ends with a surprise, Target is the kind of quality stock that will draw a lot of the 'safe' money.

Apple Stock Is Starting to Look Very Cheap Again;11/6/2016;"During September and early October, shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) rallied from around $105 to nearly $120, helped   along by every new story detailingSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 disaster.Apple then reported solid earnings for its fourth fiscal   quarter and forecast that revenue would start growing again in   Q1. Yet since the earnings report,Apple stockhas fallen into a steep dive. On Thursday, it tumbled below $110   for the first time since reports of battery problems with the   Samsung Galaxy Note 7 began to circulate in early September.makeArticleAd();Apple Stock Performance, data byYCharts.With Apple now firmly on track to return to revenue and   earnings growth this year, the recent plunge in its stock price   is somewhat baffling. Indeed, Apple stock once again looks very   cheap.Apple's growth is resumingFor the current quarter, Apple expects revenue to reach $76   billion to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion a year earlier.   Revenue growth should accelerate after Q1, as year-over-year   comparisons will become much easier.Moreover, Apple's Q1 guidance could prove to be conservative.   So far, demand for the iPhone 7 Plus is vastly exceeding supply.   Part of that probably reflects people deciding to buy Apple's   ""phablet"" offering after Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 flamed out   (literally!). Yet Apple has along track recordof boosting supply to meet strong demand during the holiday   season.It's still relatively early in the quarter, but iPhone 7 Plus   supply seems to be improving gradually. More Apple Stores have at   least some iPhone 7 Plus models in stock, iPhone 7 Plus usage is   rising at a steady clip, and the lead time for the popular   jet-black version of the iPhone 7 Plus has declined   significantly. That bodes well for Apple's revenue and earnings   in Q1.More opportunities aheadThe stellar demand for the iPhone 7 Plus is a pleasant   surprise, given that it has a similar design to the iPhone 6 Plus   and iPhone 6s Plus. Not too long ago, some pundits thought iPhone   sales would decline again in fiscal 2017. (The Samsung Galaxy   Note 7 was initially expected to be a tough iPhone 7 Plus   competitor.)Apple is seeing very strong demand for the new iPhone 7 Plus.   Image source: Apple.Next year, Apple is expected to unveil aradical redesignof the iPhone in honor of the iPhone's 10th anniversary. That   could drive a big upgrade cycle, while bringing in lots of new   users, as was the case when the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus   launched two years ago. In that fiscal year, iPhone unit sales   jumped 37% year over year, causing Apple stock to surge   higher.Apple's recent Mac lineup refresh could also contribute to   revenue growth, especially since Apple dramatically raised the   prices of several models. Meanwhile, Apple's services business   continues to deliver steady growth, primarily driven by rising   App Store sales, as well as growth in AppleCare subscriptions,   possibly linked to Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program.Is Apple stock a bargain again?After falling below $110 on Thursday, Apple shares trade for   about 12 times the company's projected fiscal 2017 earnings.   That's a significant discount to the S&P 500 in and of   itself.However, Apple also continues to have a huge amount of excess   cash. Apple's $150 billion net cash position accounts for a   quarter of its market cap. If the U.S. government ever manages to   reform corporate taxes, Apple may have an opportunity to   repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars of overseas cash at a   relatively low tax rate. It could then use this cash for share   repurchases or a big special dividend.After adjusting for the value of this excess cash, Apple   stock's current valuation is closer to 10 times forward   earnings.Furthermore, analysts may be underestimating Apple's earnings   power this year. If Apple can steal a meaningful number of   customers who would have purchased Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, it   could blow past analysts' earnings estimates, because the iPhone   7 Plus is such a profitable product.It pays to buy the dipsApple stock has hit plenty of ruts in the past five years. But   each time the stock has sold off, it has bounced back in short   order, rewarding investors who went against the herd and bought   shares of Apple when the stock was struggling.Apple is poised to return to solid revenue and earnings growth   this year, largely thanks to better-than-expected demand for the   iPhone 7 Plus. Next year's iPhone 8 product cycle will probably   drive even faster growth. With these (and other) opportunities   ahead, Apple stock shouldn't be trading at its current   rock-bottom valuation. It probably won't stay down for long.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock’s Leaders Should Consider a Breakup;11/4/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoore's Second Law sucks. Everyone knows Moore's Law. The idea, first propounded in anElectronics Magazinearticle 50 years ago byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore, is that semiconductors can get twice as dense, and twice as fast, every 18 months, doubling their price-performance.Source:stargazer2020 via FlickrMoore's Law drives the technology economy, but few acknowledge what I call Moore's Second Law, which is that the cost of the gear needed to make chips will also multiply as circuit densities increase.makeArticleAd();Moore's Second Law has driven the vast majority of chip companies out of the manufacturing end of the business. It needs to drive Intel out, too.The way to do that would be to split the company into two parts. One would be dedicated to designing and selling semiconductors, which is mainly a function of software and dealing with customers who design products. The other would be dedicated to making them, which is a function of capital and dealing with customers that need chips. It's the one logical step Intel management has fiercely resisted … that it has flatly rejected.9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in     the Long RunShareholders have suffered enough.Consider ARM HoldingsARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH) competes directly with Intel in microprocessors, but doesn't really compete with it at all.The British companywas acquiredbySoftbank Group Corp(OTCMKTS:SFTBF) in September for $32 billion, but for many years before that it had been running rings around its larger rival, delivering shareholders a 10-year gain of over 950% while Intel's performance ware barely half that of theNASDAQ Composite.The secret of ARM's success was that it only sold chip designs. Other companies, likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), bought the designs, tweaked them to their specifications, then had companies likeSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) manufacture them. The customers got a custom design for a competitive price.INTC stock had similar problems in the mobile space, whereBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) ran rings around it for years. Intel tried to sell chips and showed Chinese OEMs software that would work with the chips. Broadcom sold designs the OEMs could quickly get to market and sell. Since Broadcom, like ARM Holdings, wasn't responsible for the economics of manufacture, it wasn't selling a one-size-fits-all solution.As PCs have become less important, INTC has suffered from its lack of flexibility. Profit margins have plummeted and debt levels have increased.INTC stock has become a yield stock, one bought for its dividend, currently yielding 3.1%, but for the quarter ending in July, that dividend ate an alarming part of Intel's earnings. A crisis is at hand.New Markets Require New Thinking From INTC StockCEO Brian Krzanich, who took command of the company in 2013, is an Intel lifer and steeped in the corporate culture. He even holds a patent for semiconductor processing.He announceda new strategy in Aprilthat was heavy on buzzwords like cloud, Internet of Things and 5G, but light on details.Intel stock continues to lead in processing chips used in cloud data centers, but it's facingnew competition from graphics chips, an unexpected direction. Graphic chip industry leaderNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), which like ARM does not own a fabrication plant, is up 144% just in the last year.Intel is not the industry leader in communications, either. That honor belongs toQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), whose Internet of Things strategy has been to buyNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI)for $47 billion, about half its own valuation. It's the kind of big bet Intel would never engage in.The Bottom Line for Intel StockIntel's past is that of a semi-monopolist that controlled its market.

Apple Inc.'s New iPhone 8 Strategy Sounds Brilliant;11/2/2016;"This year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) released two flagship smartphones -- the iPhone 7   and iPhone 7 Plus -- continuing with the trend that it set when   it launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus back in late 2014.   Next year, however, the iDevice maker is expected to break with   that not-so-long-standing tradition and launch not just two   iPhones, but three.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Per areportfrom generally reliable Japanese publicationNikkei, next year's iPhones will come in three different sizes. The   smallest will be a 4.7-inch model, keeping with the tradition set   with the launch of the iPhone 6. The next step up will be a   5-inch model, with a supposedly ""premium"" model occupying a   pricing tier above the 5-inch mode.Even more interestingly, while the 4.7-inch and 5-inch models   are expected to use flat liquid crystal displays, the 5.5-inch   model is expected to employ a curved OLED display.This strategy is smart and could ultimately lead to both unit   share gains for Apple in the premium portion of the smartphone   market and a boost in average selling prices. Here's why.Of the three options, this one is probably     bestThere's no denying that a certain segment of the   smartphone-buying population appreciates the aesthetic of a   curved OLED display. Such displays are certainly part of the   reason theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S7 Edge has done as well as it has in   the marketplace, and why the major China-based smartphone   manufacturers, such as Xiaomi, Huawei, and others, are rolling   out premium smartphone models incorporating curved OLED   displays.Putting curved OLED displays, especially high-quality ones   that meet Apple's demanding display performance specifications,   on a smartphone is unlikely to be cheap. So with the iPhone 8   generation, Apple was probably faced with the following   options:Absorb the increased cost structure associated with putting     curved OLED displays on all of its iPhone models.Restrict the use of curved OLED displays to a premium     model, one that starts at a price much greater than what     current iPhones start at.Don't use curved OLEDs on any iPhones during the iPhone 8     generation.Option 1 isn't desirable because it'd almost certainly be   gross profit margin-dilutive. Option 3 may be viable, but it   could cause Apple to lose both unit share and, perhaps equally   importantly, mind share -- imagine hearing, for example, that   ""Apple is no longer innovative.""Option 2, at least to this Fool, seems by far the best option.   Customers who absolutely want the most cutting-edge display   technology but prefer Apple and its software ecosystem will have   the option of getting that technology from Apple -- for a higher   price.That's preferable to not giving customers who want those   features no choice but to buy devices from Apple's competitors --   hence the potential for Apple to gain share in premium   smartphones.Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted on the company's October earnings   call that demand for the iPhone 7 Plus relative to the cheaper   iPhone 7 is greater than the company had originally planned for.   So given the relative popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus, it's   reasonable to believe that iPhone customers are willing to pay   for innovative new features.Share gains and average selling price increases both on     the tableI believe that a decent portion of the Apple iPhone installed   base would have gone with a non-premium iPhone as their next   device. To the extent that those current customers do move up a   tier -- and if the ""premium"" iPhone is attractive, this may be a   common occurrence -- Apple should see a bump in the average   selling price.However, what's potentially more interesting is that an iPhone   that's a lights-out, technological tour-de-force could bring back   into the Apple ecosystem customers who felt that Apple wasn't   building products for them anymore. That could cover, for   example, Galaxy S7 Edge and Galaxy Note7 buyers. Not only would   bringing in a significant number of such customers help Apple   drive unit-share gains, since these customers wouldn't have   purchased iPhones otherwise, but again, it would also help   average selling prices.The prospect of seeing these dynamics play out should be quite   exciting toApple stockholders, particularly given how much of Apple's businessultimately depends on iPhone sales.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

Why Integrated Device Technology Inc. Stock Soared Today;11/1/2016;"Image source: Integrated Device Technology Inc.What happenedShares ofIntegrated Device Technology Inc.(NASDAQ: IDTI) were up 10.1% as of 2:00 p.m. EDT Tuesday after   the mixed-signal solutions specialist announced mixed fiscal   second-quarter 2017 results, and followed with encouraging   guidance.makeArticleAd();So whatQuarterly revenue climbed 8.6% year over year, to $184.1   million, and translated to a 12.1% decline in adjusted net   income, to $47.4 million. Adjusted net income per share fell 2.9%   year over year, to $0.34.To be fair, IDT's bottom-line declines might not sound   encouraging. But analysts, on average, were expecting the company   to report adjusted earnings of only $0.33 per share, albeit on   slightly higher revenue of $185.1 million.Now whatFor the current quarter, IDT expects revenue of $176 million,   plus or minus $5 million. Curiously, that's below analysts'   consensus estimates, which called for fiscal Q3 revenue of   roughly $185.9 million.But management also elaborated that two items, in particular,   caused revenue guidance to be roughly $9 million lower than it   would have been otherwise. The first, comprising around $6   million of that reduction, is the well-known cancellation ofSamsung's Galaxy Note 7 program. IDT has no custom devices designed into   the Note 7, removing any concerns over inventory writedowns. And   most encouraging along this vein is that IDT anticipates the   majority of its impact will occur in this quarter, with minimal   negative consequences in future quarters and the affected   wireless power business expected to return to growth in the March   quarter.The second, comprising the remaining $3 million of the   reduction, was IDT's divestment of a small commodity crystal   oscillator business during the quarter. According to IDT CEO   Gregory Waters, ""Sales from that business are in decline at very   low margins, and not contributing to earnings per share.""That's fair enough, as it makes little sense to chase a small,   declining source of incremental revenue if it comes at the   expense of profitability. So in the end, despite IDT's revenue   shortfalls, it's no surprise to see the market breathing a sigh   of relief and bidding shares up today.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Google Pixel Review: Is Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) the New Smartphone King?;11/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSeveral weeks ago,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL)unveiled its first Google-branded smartphone, the Pixel.Source: GoogleAvailable in regular and plus sizes, the newGoogle Pixelis a significant development that goes much further than the previous Nexus brand smartphones. Those promised the best Android experience, but they were co-designed by hardware manufacturers such asHTC, who shared the billing.makeArticleAd();This time, Google is aiming for not only the best Android smartphone, but the title of best smartphone available. Period.Unlike with those Nexus phones, it's charging a premium price for its all-new flagship.Does the Google Pixel have what it takes to go toe-to-toe with the likes ofApple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7? Is this smartphone's steep price tag justified? Read our Google Pixel review to find out.Google Pixel Review: Google Takes the Apple RouteWay back, Google and Apple took very different approaches in their respective smartphone strategies.Apple went with the completely closed approach, developing both the iOS operating system and the iPhone hardware. There was no third-party involvement whatsoever.7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in     Your PortfolioGoogle, however, licensed Android to any third-party smartphone manufacturers that wanted in. It stayed out of the hardware game, until dipping a toe in with the Nexus phones.While Google's approach led to smartphone market domination - over 85% of all smartphones run Android - the platform suffers from fragmentation. With users at the mercy of OEMs and often stuck on older versions of Android, Google can only get its latest and greatest features out to a small percentage of users.With the Pixel, it's taking the Apple approach.Unlike Nexus phones, Google didn't just have say in some of the hardware features, it designed the smartphones. HTC manufactured them, but its name doesn't appear anywhere on the case. And, like the iPhone, the Google Pixel was designed hand-in-hand with the latest version of Android to ensure the ideal experience.Google Assistant - one of its key features - isn't even available on third-party smartphones, assuming they were updated to the latest Android version.Buy a Google Pixel and you get a flagship smartphone, optimized to take full advantage of Android, with exclusive features and quick access to future Android upgrades (and security updates), just like Apple's iPhone and iOS.Google Pixel Review: Solid Hardware With a Killer CameraThe similarity to Apple's smartphone approach continues.Like the iPhone, the Pixel is a thin, rounded slab of machined aluminum and glass. There are differences, though, especially on the back of the Pixel, which has a section with a mirror polish and fingerprint scanner. But from the front? From a distance they bear a striking resemblance.The hardware inside the Pixel is more than capable of providing snappy performance, with the latestQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon CPU providing the power.Apple realized early on that the camera is very important for many smartphone buyers. The dual-camera system isthefeature for the new iPhone 7 Plus. Google clearly saw the same data and the Pixel phone's camera is excellent. In fact, Google claims independent testing rates it as the best smartphone camera ever.And, the company tops that off with free unlimited photo and video storage for Google Pixel owners.What Google ended up releasing is a premium flagship smartphone with a class-leading camera, high performance and the best Android experience.Not bad for a first attempt.Google Pixel Review: Specs5.0 inch Full HD AMOLED display (5.5-inch Quad HD on Pixel   XL)Source: GoogleSnapdragon 821 quad-core processor with 4GB RAM32 or 128GB storage12.3MP primary camera with 1.55μm pixels, f/2.0 Aperture, 4K   videoAerospace-grade aluminum unibody in Quite Black or Very   Silver802.11ac 2×2 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2, NFCRear fingerprint scannerUSB-C charging2,770 mAh battery with up to 13 hours Wi-Fi (3,450 mAh and 14   hours for Google Pixel Plus)Android 7.1 Nougat with Google Assistant exclusiveMSRP starting at $649 (Pixel) and $769 (Pixel Plus)Google Pixel Review: ConclusionGoogle has done a very good job with the Pixel, especially when you consider the fact that this is the company's first run as a smartphone hardware designer.Getting iPhone fans to convert is a tough goal. You're not just trying to convince them to invest in new hardware, but they have to move to an entirely different platform. New apps, new ways of doing things. There may be some switchers, but don't expect a mass exodus of disgruntled iPhone owners to jump to the Pixel.However, Android OEMs should be worried. Especially those who sell premium smartphones, likeSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). The Google Pixel has the hardware chops to take on the best, and with Google's Android integration advantage, the only way to compete is to try to out-design Google, or cut prices.It's Time for New Macs - Apple Inc. (AAPL) PC     Sales Hammered by Outdated ModelsIs the Google Pixel the best smartphone on the market? The Pixel and Pixel XL are definitelyamongthe best, but the design isn't quite on par with the iPhone or Galaxy S7 and the lack of water resistance hurts. Even the iPhone is water resistant now…However, Apple and Samsung are on notice. The next Pixel smartphone is likely to address these shortcomings and then things will get interesting.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:What to Expect from Microsoft Corporation's     (MSFT) October EventWhat to Expect From AAPPL inc.'s (AAPL) October     EventThe postGoogle Pixel Review: Is Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) the New Smartphone King?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Intel Corp.;10/29/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) have a lot in common, and a long history of working   together. Personally, I own both stocks. But if you had to choose   one of these chip stocks to buy today, which one would it be?makeArticleAd();Let's have a look.By the numbersLet's get this out of the way right at the beginning.Intel is a far larger and more diverse business than Micron.   This shows in many ways, including the stock charts. If you are a   growth-thirsty thrill seeker, one look at this chart will tell   you that Micron is right up your alley in ways that Intel just   isn't. On the other hand, risk-averse value hunters will reach   exactly the opposite conclusion:MU Total Return Pricedata byYChartsAnd if that wasn't obvious enough, these fundamental financial   differences between Micron and Intel just might tip your   scales:Financial MetricIntelMicronRevenue (TTM)$57.9 billion$12.4 billionNet Income (TTM)$10.4 billion$(276) millionEBITDA Profit (TTM)$22.3 billion$3.3 billionTotal Cash$17.8 billion$4.4 billionTotal Debt$27.6 billion$9.9 billionCredit RatingA1 (medium investment-grade)Ba3 (non-investment grade, speculative)Data from Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trailing twelve months.It really doesn't matter how you slice it. Intel always comes   out as the more stable and reliable choice in this contest. The   company's credit rating is comparable to that of major banks, and   better than those of some European countries. But a bank or a   country with Micron's risky credit rating is standing with one   leg in all-out bankruptcy already.Micron is neither a bank nor a country, though -- plenty of   respectable businesses get by just fine with speculative-grade   credit ratings. But interest rates will be higher when they take   out loans, and these ratings are a good indication of business   risk. In a nutshell, Intel is a low-risk investment, while Micron   investors must accept a higher level of financial risk.The case for MicronIf all signs point in favor of Intel, why would anybody want   to own Micron instead?Micron's chosen trade is extremely cyclical. Sure, Intel's   order volume moves up and down with the economy, with the   short-term popularity of PC systems, with the global need for   big-iron enterprise servers, and many other factors. But none of   these market-moving factors can hold a candle to the drastic ups   and downs of the computer memory market.In short, Micron is subject to all of the same product demand   drivers that affect Intel --plusregularly occurring price wars that have nothing to do with   end-user demand.When memory market leadersSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , Hynix, and Micron get along, street prices   for memory chips can hold steady for years at a time. In these   times of prosperity, Micron's sales and profits skyrocket. The   stock generally follows suit.That's what happened in 2012-2014. At the time, Micron had a a   newfound pricing power thanks tothe recently completed buyout of bankrupt rival   Elpida, and the company used this power to full effect. Holding back on   production volumes, Micron shifted the global supply-and-demand   equation significantly, and memory prices stabilized in a big   way:MUdata byYChartsRight now, Micron is knee-deep in yet another price war.   Samsung is putting the production pedal to the metal, not   terribly worried about the effect this market-flooding action is   having on memory prices. The Korean giant can afford to take some   losses in an attempt to increase its market share, because memory   chips are just a small part of a much larger technology   conglomerate.Micron doesn't have that luxury to the same degree, as any   change in memory prices shows up immediately on the bottom line.   That effect has killed plenty of vulnerable memory producers over   the years. This is the largest risk, and it weighs heavily on   Micron's credit ratings and financial future.As cyclical markets go, this downturn shall eventually pass.   One of these days, Samsung will have reached its internal market   share goals and shifted into profit-taking mode. Production   volumes go down, memory prices stabilize again, and the survivors   of the last shakeout get to share another bonanza.Buying Micron today is a bet on this company making it to that   next party date. That's a bet I'm perfectly willing to make,   thanks to Micron's robust cash balance and solid cash flows even   in the face of Samsung's worst market floods.Which stock should you buy?Intel and Micron play very different roles, but are both very   welcome parts of my investment portfolio. Micron's next upturn   will come, and Intel will continue to chug along like the   unstoppable juggernaut it is.If you're on the sidelines of both stocks today, one of these   investments will be a much better fit for your investment   strategy than the other. Choose accordingly. But for long-term   omnivores like yours truly, there are no bad choices here.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Why Is Qualcomm Suing This Chinese Phone Maker?;10/28/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the largest mobile chipmaker in the world,   recently filed patent infringement suits  against Chinese   smartphone makerMeizuin the U.S., Germany, and France. The chipmaker previously filed   another suit against Meizu in China back in June.Qualcomm claims that Meizu is refusing to negotiate patent   licensing deals for the chipmaker's 3G and 4G technologies. Let's   take a closer look at these disputed patents, and why they matter   so much to Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Image source: Meizu.The story thus far...Qualcomm's patent licensing (QTL) business, which generates   the lion's share of its operating profits, owns a massive   portfolio of wireless technologies. That portfolio enables it to   take  a 3%-5% cut of the wholesale price of every smartphone   sold worldwide.That deal was widely accepted while smartphone sales were   booming, but as prices fell with the commoditization of the   market, smartphone makers complained that the royalties crushed   their already thin margins. A recent Canaccord Genuity report   found that, out of all the smartphone makers in the world, onlyAppleandSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)  generated  significant profits from   smartphone sales. In response to Qualcomm's licensing fees, many   OEMs -- particularly in China -- started underreporting shipments   to pay Qualcomm lower licensing fees.Instead of helping Qualcomm, the Chinese government slapped   the company with a $975 million antitrust fine, and forced it to   lower its royalty rates last year. Qualcomm then had to   renegotiate new licensing agreements with OEMs on its own. Many   major Chinese OEMs, including market leadersHuawei,Xiaomi,Oppo, andVivo, all negotiated new terms with Qualcomm. The new agreements also   included back payments on previously underreported shipments.Why won't Meizu work with Qualcomm?Meizu shipped 20 million smartphones last year, making it one   of the 12 biggest smartphone makers in the world. However, the   company is still dwarfed by the top five smartphone makers in    China -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Apple -- and   only has a minimal presence in Western markets. Speaking toDigital Trends, a Meizu spokesman claimed that the company was working   ""with Qualcomm to advance toward an agreement,"" but that it   respected ""Qualcomm's right to use legal measures.""Meizu doesn't use Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips in its handsets.   It mainly puts cheaperMediaTekchips for its lower-end devices, and Samsung's Exynos chips into   its higher-end devices. Therefore, Meizumightsimply be irritated that it has to pay Qualcomm patent   royalties when it doesn't actually use any Qualcomm hardware. But   more than likely, it's all about the numbers -- Meizu simply   can't squeeze out a profit in the cutthroat Chinese smartphone   market if it lowers its pricesandpays Qualcomm its desired cut.Qualcomm's lawsuits against Meizu are probably intended to   discourage other Chinese OEMs from following the defiant OEM's   example. Qualcomm already resolved a similar dispute withLGearlier this year, and it's simply taking steps to ensure that   OEMs understand that refusing to sign new licensing agreements   could lead to costly lawsuits.What this all means for QualcommQualcomm's clash with Meizu illustrates how tough it can be   for U.S. tech companies looking to collect unpaid fees or   royalties in China. It also  shows how the commoditization   of the smartphone market could eventually knock its QTL business,   which generated 98% of its pre-tax profits last quarter, off   track. As more OEMs and government regulators protest Qualcomm's   licensing fees, it will likely need to diversify its patent   portfolio into less mature markets.That's probably why Qualcomm recently agreed to acquireNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world,   for  more than $37 billion. That purchase would likely add   thousands of new automotive and secure chip patents to Qualcomm's   portfolio, breathing fresh life into its QTL business and   decreasing the unit's dependence on smartphones. Therefore, the   real story here isn't about Meizu -- it's about the actions   Qualcomm must take to ensure that its QTL business remains the   company's core profit driver for years to come.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q3 Earnings: Great Googly Moogly!;10/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe investment lesson of this decade is that cloud rules. Once you have an addictive application running inside cloud data centers, the software scales automatically and the sky is the limit on profits.Source: Google/SamsungGoogle - from the artist now known asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) - was the initial addictive cloud application.makeArticleAd();While Google didn't invent the cloud concept, itwasthe first company to take full advantage of it, virtualizing its software in scaled data centers, and using distributed computing to create vast streams of data that have made it the world's dominant computing company.The question as Alphabet announced third-quarter earnings on October 27, then, was how high could the cloud go?The consensus number on earnings for the third quarter was $8.63 per share of GOOGL stock on revenues of $22.05 billion. The hoped-for ""whisper number"" was for $8.72 per share in earnings. This compared with earnings of $8.59 per share and revenues of $20.6 billion in the second quarter.7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in     Your PortfolioIn other words, more cloud efficiency, more money on the bottom line - even if revenue soured a little.In the five days before earnings, Google shares mirrored the behavior of theNasdaq, as they frequently do, rising 2% on Monday, giving that back over the succeeding three days, but still sitting near their all-time high. While most analysts had buy ratings on GOOGL stock, Wedbush's James Dix was calling ita ""sell.""So, how did he do?The Number and Its MeaningIt was a beat. Make that a beatdown.Alphabet net income came in at $6.326 billion, or $9.06 per share, on revenues of $22.451 billion. Earnings were up 34% from a year ago, and revenues were up 20%. Cost per click fell as YouTube cut traffic acquisition costs on mobile.The initial reaction was to take shares up 2.1%, to $830, after they closed at around $817.Most of what investors saw was simply full speed ahead. Traffic acquisition costs were 21% of revenue, just as they had been in the second quarter, and the same as a year ago. The revenue rise of 20% was in line with the second quarter's 21%. The big surprise was paid clicks, up 33%, against 29% in the second quarter, meaning mobile and YouTube are now contributing strongly to earnings. Alphabet's core business had operating earnings of $6.8 billion, up from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. The board also announced another $7 billion in share buybacks.Reports that Google Fiber would cut back on its expansion plans, lay off people in many cities and look toward lower-cost ways of expanding access, instead ofdigging up my street(as they're doing now), had created bearish sentiment. Craig Barratt, who had led the Google Fiber effort, announced he is stepping down, and the company seemed anxious to see ifWebpass, acquired earlier this year, could deliver wireless technology that would reduce costs.But reining in such ""other bets"" should have investors cheering.You see, this means more of Google's earnings are falling to the Alphabet bottom line. Alphabet is dropping its efforts in robotics and fiber cable,which are mature technologies, cutting operating losses, focusing instead on things like healthcare and self-driving cars, where it can create earth-shaking innovation.Can Google Win in Hardware?Attention now turns to Christmas and how GOOGL does as a hardware company.In the past few weeks, the company has announced four important hardware products - the Google home speaker andhome control system, Daydream Viewvirtual reality headset, thePixel phoneand the Jamboardwhiteboard.The Daydream View will need to compete with a host of entrants includingFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), although the bigger threats should beSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which can tie their headsets to existing video game platforms.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Needs to Sink     Even FurtherGoogle Home is a direct attack onAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo, which created the market a year ago and still dominates it. GOOGL is hoping that great design, and its brand name, can eat into Amazon's early lead.The phone has a big opportunity, given the problems atSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) with its Galaxy Note 7. Advertising for the product has already begun, and the company doesn't have to sell big numbers right away, because the Android ecosystem already dominates the market with a 70% share.The Jamboard will take more time to reach the market, but re-imagining the whiteboard as a cloud device, something that can be shared among multiple groups, could transform the way offices work over time.The key to that is ""over time.""

It's responsible for the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE and a chunk of iPhone 7 orders.What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election?Nikkei, however, claims Foxconn lacks the technological know-how to make the glass backs for the iPhone 8. It's suggesting Chinese firmsBiel CrystalandLens Technology Co Ltdwill get the nod from Apple Inc. to make this key component for the glass iPhone.That report also suggests AAPL is planning to move from a two model lineup to three with the iPhone 8. It's not clear at this point whether the iPhone SE will continue to be offered, but it seems likely considering that the smallest iPhone 8 remains the current 4.7-inches.10th Anniversary iPhone 8 Could be a ""Smash"" HitApple has a history of offering all-glass iPhones. While most people today think of the the Apple smartphone as the one that launched the aluminum and glass look, 2010's iPhone 4 and then the iPhone 4s featured glass backs.Shattered iPhonesback then were common, which probably one reason why AAPL made the move to an aluminum back, starting with the iPhone 5.Almost all smartphone manufacturers, however, have switched to aluminum. With its 10th anniversary release, Apple Inc. wants the new iPhone to stand out from the crowd. It also wants it to look visually different from the 7 and 7 series to spur upgraders who've held onto their old iPhones because the new ones look the same.Going back to the glass front and back, held together with a metal band, would kill two birds with one stone in that respect. Apple presumably learned from the iPhone 4/4s user experience, and this time the glass back panel will be a little more resilient. Going with glass would also let Apple feature the glossy finish that has provenso popular with the Jet Black iPhone 7, without the same risk of scratches.The other interesting aspect of theNikkeistory is the move to three sizes from the current two for the iPhone 8. That would jive with earlier reports that AAPL wasmoving to a curved AMOLED display next year.In this scenario, the company would likely keep at least the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 (and possibly the 5-inch model as well) using therecord-setting LCD displaycurrently in the iPhone 7. The 5.5-inch iPhone 8 would get the pricier curved AMOLED display and carry a premium price tag to go along with it.As would be expected, none of the companies involved (and certainly not Apple) are commenting.Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Android Is at its Most     Vulnerable Right NowAs usual, we'll have to wait nearly a year to see what AAPL officially has cooked up for it's new iPhone. Even this early in the game, however, hints are starting to emerge from its supply chain. It's a safe bet the iPhone's 10th anniversary will be a big release.Launching an all-glass iPhone 8 in three sizes would certainly help to drum up interest and could takeApple stockback to those glory days when people would line up outside the Apple Store for days waiting to snag one.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Could Apple Inc.

Winners and Losers of the Galaxy Note 7 Recall;10/27/2016;"BeyondSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , the Galaxy Note 7's discontinuation will   help and hurt other players throughout the smartphone industry,   including chip manufacturers and other suppliers.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA,   discuss who stands to win and who stands to lose.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock     price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know     investors! To be one of them,just click here.This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone   market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that   were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note   owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device,   maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big   beneficiaries with this?Evan Niu:I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start   with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because   Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers.   Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the   components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party   part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might   suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within   Samsung itself.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)  probably loses a little bit because the   Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants...Lewis:Can you explain what the Snapdragon does?Niu:Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated   modem and all these things. It's one of the most part and pieces   of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have   all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung   has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I   think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no   Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix,   they've improved their chips a little bit and got more   competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and   Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit,   since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore.   But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot   intoApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7,   probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not   totally out of the picture.Lewis:Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy.Niu:Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining.   And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not   Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because   Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the   first time ever, Apple has gone toIntel-- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now,   this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel,   depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would   say certainly Apple.Lewis:Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues   around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to   think...Niu:Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares   just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this   stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear   that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already   been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every   quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're   like, ""Highest Android switcher rates ever."" I think that trend   is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest   Android OEMs hitting into this wall here.As mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel,   to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem,   they benefit.Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) , I think, is a big winner here too. They actually   just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan   semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another   change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual   sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan   Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only   brought on Taiwan semiconductor one or two years ago. But now,   supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's   exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow   to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip   manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is   going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings, it was   pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the   exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan   Semiconductor raised fourth quarter guidance, and that raised   guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones   being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even   before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their   forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday   quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders   going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're   probably a pretty big winner here.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we   get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a   general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple   reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan   Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone   business.Niu:Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me   away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said,   ""This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued,""   which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as   third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're   pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help   their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be   affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost   because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of   the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the   customer and get these things off the market. I don't think   there's going to be any damage to them.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and     recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

Apple Inc.’s Apple Pay Volume Skyrockets 500% (AAPL);10/26/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the (few) bright spots inApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) latest quarterly earnings report was Apple Pay.Source: AppleTransaction volume for Apple's mobile payment solution were up a whopping 500% year-over-year. On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced that the number of Apple Pay transactions in September alone exceeded the volume for all of 2015.makeArticleAd();That's good news. But better still is that Apple Pay could have a whole lot more runway left.Mobile Payments Are Gaining Acceptance. Apple Pay Is Gaining Ground.Go back several years, and mobile payments were a mess. Technology companies, cellular providers, financial institutions, credit card companies and retailers were all pushing the idea. But the landscape was littered with competing solutions, retailers were balking at the cost of installing terminals and confused consumers were avoiding the technology.In 2012, despite the growing number of competing services,U.S. consumers spent only $500 million using mobile payments systems. And almost all of those transactions took place atStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX), using that company's own mobile payment app.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Just Failed Its Q4     Earnings TestWith the launch of Apple Pay in late 2014, along with competing services likeSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Samsung Pay andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Pay, mobile payments began to take off. In-store mobile payments tripled in volume in 2015 compared to the previous year, and are on track for a record 2016.Business Insideris predicting U.S. in-storemobile payment transactions will hit $75 billion this year, reaching $503 billion by 2020.AAPL has taken a lead in the U.S. with mobile payments. In June,FortunereportedApple Pay accounts for three-fourths of all U.S. contactless payments.How Profitable is Apple Pay?AAPL collects a 0.15% transaction fee for every purchase made using Apple Pay. That works out to just 15 cents on every $100 spent. That seems trivial compared to the $400 or so in profit the company reaps from the sales of every iPhone 7. However, when you look at the big picture - the huge potential for mobile payments worldwide - the numbers can add up quickly.That $503 billion in U.S in-store payments in 2020 would represent more than $750 million in fees for AAPL if Apple Pay were used.That's just the U.S., and just in-store.Worldwide mobile payments are expected to hit $620 billionthis year. And then there's online shopping, where services likePayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) currently dominate.Apple didn't break out Apple Pay revenue in itsearnings report, but it falls under the Services segment. And Services saw revenue of $6.3 billion, up from $5 billion compared to the previous year.Apple Pay Has More Room for GrowthApple's Pay's 500% volume growth compared to last year is impressive. The fact that its mobile payment service saw more transactions in September than all of 2015, even more so.The company's recent move of adding Apple Pay support in Safari with the latest MacOS and iOS releases is a step that is likely to extend AAPL's financial reach. It's also expected to steal a chunk of business from PayPal as consumers shop online for Christmas gifts. Last year on Black Friday,over 27% of all online purchases on Black Friday came from iOS devices…Apple is also furiously expanding support for Apple Pay,rolling the service out to China, Canada and other countries in 2016. It has also continued to aggressively expand its network of participating retailers, banks and credit cards.Apple Inc.'s Apple Watch Sales Are a Mess     (AAPL)Apple Pay may not have the sort of lead-up and excitement of a new iPhone launch, and it's certainly nowhere near generating the same numbers. However, it's proving to be an increasingly valuable product for AAPL. It provides recurring revenue the company can count on. That revenue stream has high growth potential, and once the initial agreement is made with a vendor, there's little effort or expenditure required on Apple's part to keep the money flowing.The latest earnings report show that while mobile payments have been an elusive pipe dream for many companies, AAPL is making it work, and in an increasingly big way.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election?7 Top Stocks to Buy for Months of Red-Hot     ReturnsThe postApple Inc.'s Apple Pay Volume Skyrockets 500% (AAPL)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. to Be Only Manufacturer of Apple Inc. A11 Chip;10/26/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is among the world's most popular   smartphones. The company shipped more than 231 million iPhones   during its fiscal year 2015, and it is on track to ship more than   200 million iPhones in its fiscal year 2016.makeArticleAd();This immense scale means that investors are very interested in   which companies ultimately win contracts to supply key components   into Apple's iPhones -- and rightfully so.One such component is Apple's internally designed A-series   processors that power the iPhone. Although Apple does the heavy   lifting to design these chips, the company relies on third-party   chip manufacturers to take those designs and bring them to   life.For many generations, Apple relied exclusively onSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) to manufacture its processors. However, in   2014, Apple chose to tapTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) to build the A8 chip that powered the highly   successful iPhone 6 series of phones.The follow-on A9 processor was dual-sourced from both Samsung   and TSMC, with reports suggesting that Samsung had won most of   the orders. This year's A10 Fusion processor is believed to be   manufactured exclusively by TSMC.PerDigiTimes, Apple's next-generation processor, which is likely to be called   the A11 Fusion, will be manufactured only by TSMC.TSMC is the logical choice for A11It doesn't come as a big surprise that Apple is planning to   build all the A11 Fusion chips at TSMC. TSMC's own public   commentary around its expected market share during the   10-nanometer generation strongly hinted at this.Nevertheless, having more confirmation is never a bad   thing.To be perfectly blunt, all indications point to TSMC's having   a stronger offering with its own 10-nanometer technology than   what Samsung will have available at the time.TSMC's technology should offer better chip area density, which   means that Apple can cram more features and functionality into a   given chip area than it could on the Samsung technology.Furthermore, given TSMC's track record here, I would expect   its 10-nanometer technology to offer superior performance,   ultimately allowing Apple to deliver the same performance at   lower power or more performance in the same power envelope as an   equivalent, Samsung-built part.And finally, I have more confidence in TSMC's ability to   achieve good manufacturing yields (this impacts cost and   supply) on its 10-nanometer technology in time for the   iPhone 8 ramp than I do in Samsung's.TSMC's iPhone share should surge in 2017During the current iPhone cycle, TSMC should have the majority   share of Apple's A-series business since it has 100% of the   A10 orders and a minority allocation of the A9 orders (some   reports have pegged TSMC's share of the A9 at 30%).However, there's clearly room for TSMC to grow its share since   Samsung is likely still supplying a good portion of the A9 chips   that currently power the low-cost iPhone SE and the mid-range   iPhone 6s-series phones.If TSMC has won 100% of the A11 orders, then it could achieve   100% share of Apple's application processor orders, since the   A10-powered iPhone 7-series phones would become Apple's mid-range   offering, and the iPhone SE will probably get an update in 2017,   as well.Additional iPhone applications' processor share would   ultimately translate into higher revenues and profits for TSMC --   always a good thing for stockholders.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Two Reasons Samsung Faces an Uphill Battle After the Galaxy Note 7 Debacle;10/26/2016;"TheSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 debacle couldn't come at a worse   time, as consumer electronics companies gear up ahead of the busy   holiday shopping season.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu, CFA,   discuss this year's smartphone product cycles.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock     price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know     investors! To be one of them,just click here.This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and   returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life   cycles of smartphones. You look at a place likeChipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product   via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back   in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine   purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone   every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the   likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry   there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones,   or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to   the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're   second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might   decide to go over to something on the iOS side.Evan Niu:Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out.   Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard   over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course,   they have to get Android fromGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and they do their whole   modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try   to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't   actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good.   They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their   hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good   reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has   been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their   one strength is now being called into question...Lewis:People are going to go elsewhere.Niu:Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android,   there's tons of really good Android phones out there.Lewis:I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is   offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other   Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save   some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising   to see some flight from the brand.One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the   timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season,   and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics.   To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter   where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at   least ...Niu:And one of their most expensive, most profitable products,   too.Lewis:Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that,   as a business.Niu:Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone   makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of   their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to   the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's   bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has   established itself as the phablet leader, andApplenow has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and   doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty   comparable, as far as giant phones go.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Alphabet (A shares), Apple, and Chipotle Mexican     Grill.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock: Too Big (Momentum) to Fail!;10/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more missteps over the last year than the law of the market should allow. But GOOGL stock will not pay for them in the quarterly earnings statement due out on Oct. 27, because the momentum of its base business is just too strong.Source:Travis Wise via FlickrThe consensus on earnings, which will be releasedafter the market closes, is that Alphabet earned $8.63 per share, on $17.91 billion of revenue for the three months ending in September. That's more than 1% of its recent price of $831, and the whisper number on those earnings is an eye-popping $8.72.makeArticleAd();As its earnings week began, GOOGL stock was on fire, up over $10 a share, and with analysts now predicting it should easily clear$1,000 per share.Over the past year, the stock has advanced 15% in price, although over half of that gain came in the last months of 2015. Investors were worried about ""other bets"" like Google Fiber, its autonomous cars and its healthcare operations. Those worries were blown apart by second-quarter earnings, which came in at $8.59 per share in profit on revenue of $21.5 billion.7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to     RichesThere are reasons to worry about the company, just not enough to start worrying about Alphabet stock.Why Worry Now About GOOGL Stock?Google, whose unofficial slogan was once condensed to ""Don't be Evil,"" is now seen as the epitome of evil by many governments and by privacy rights activists.Google and its search algorithms are synonymous with the internet itself. Its advertising technology is synonymous with fears of freedom being stripped away by private and public entities. It seems to be losing its battle with Europe overthe so-called ""right to be forgotten,""giving other governments around the world the chance to censor the internet resource for everyone.Every time GOOGL expands its range of consumer services, or even tweaks them,whole industriesfeel threatened. Google's intrinsic advertising has destroyed the newspaper business, and now threatens the remainingtelecommunications and television business models.Everywhere Google turns, it is creating new competitors.Google's efforts to go beyond consumer services, into selling cloud to business, is still being hammered byAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), whichgot into the market first. The unit is now going through a re-branding underVMware Inc.(NYSE:VMW)co-founder Diane Greene, and its business services are being called the ""G Suite.""Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has worked for the last year to create discipline among what are now called the company's ""other bets,"" so investors now know what's not working. What investors have found is thatmostof those bets are not working. The Nest thermostat is not working. Google Fiber is not working. Robots are not working. And its medical efforts are alsofailing to deliver.All this has some analysts worried.Why You Don't WorryBut there are far more reasons tonotworry about GOOGL stock.Alphabet has executed its move to mobile, and more than half its ad revenue now comes fromphones rather than PCs.The company is about to add a new subscription revenue stream to YouTube, and is rapidlysigning up cable channels.Google is also becoming a hardware company, announcing the Pixel phone just asSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)suffersfrom problems withits Galaxy 7, delivering a virtual reality headset called the Daydream View and launching Google Home against the Amazon Echo, in part to improve its voice interfaces.Netflix, Inc.

Samsung's Firestorm Could Be Spreading to the Galaxy S7 Edge;10/25/2016;"One of these phones might be safe. Can you tell which one?   Image source: Samsung.You've probably heard by now thatSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 has been too hot to handle, in   the most literal sense. Following widespread reports of the   phablet spontaneously catching fire, Samsung promptly -- and, it   came to be clear, prematurely -- recalled 2.5 million units of   the Galaxy Note 7, only to watch its initial hypothesis ofwhythey were combusting crash and burn.makeArticleAd();That led to replacement phones also catching fire, and the   South Korean conglomerate subsequentlyaxed the deviceonce and for all. Anyone who has been to an airport recently has   probably seen the numerous large signs advising people that the   device is banned on all U.S. flights due to safety concerns (even   if it's turned off).Brand infernoAnother particular challenge for Samsung has been tocontain the brand conflagration, since its flagship devices all bear similar model names.   There's the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Galaxy Note 7, and   those are just the main flagships; there are plenty of other   handsets under the Galaxy umbrella.The last thing that Samsung wants is for customers to avoid   the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge for fear that those devices would   catch fire as well, particularly as those are the two remaining   phones that Samsung is actively trying to steer former Note 7   buyers toward. As it turns out, perhaps those fears wouldn't be   misplaced after all.A hot messWe're now seeing fresh reports that there have been at least   two new cases of Galaxy S7 Edge phones catching fire.Android Headlinesreports that a man in Canada was driving home from work when his   Galaxy S7 Edge caught fire. The man noticed the smoke coming from   his phone and promptly threw it out of his car window. He then   covered the phone in snow in an effort to put out the fire.Phone Arenatells the story of a customer who had received a Galaxy S7 Edge   as a replacement for his Galaxy Note 7, but the new phone caught   fire while charging overnight with the first-party charger. I   doubt he'll be buying another Samsung phone anytime soon.These aren't even the only instances that have been reported;   this is just the past week. There was another in Ohio, one in   China, and one in the Philippines -- all in September. Yet, even   after a handful of instances, there haven't been as many   incendiary headlines around the S7 Edge. Most of the media   firestorm is being focused on the Note 7.Sammy needs to figure this outAll fire jokes aside, Samsung needs to get to the bottom of   this. Beyond consumer safety concerns, the most perplexing aspect   of this whole ordeal is that Samsung is still unable to reproduce   the problems and can't isolate the technical problem. The only   thing more troubling than making phones that combust is the   possibility of inadvertently making even more of them in the   future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc.’s Apple Watch Sales Are a Mess (AAPL);10/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMarket research firm IDC just released smartwatch sales numbers for the third quarter, and there's plenty of bad news forApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its Apple Watch.Source: AppleThe latest numbers show that the smartwatch industry as a whole is suffering steep declines. But AAPL is among the hardest-hit companies; sales of the Apple Watch plunged over 70% year-over-year.makeArticleAd();The question now is: Can Apple recover?Smartwatch Sales Take a DiveIt was never clear whether there was actually widespread consumer demand for smartwatches. The whole category began to take off afterPebblelaunched its record-setting Kickstarter campaign in 2012. However, to put things in perspective,that campaign raised $10 million-plusand saw nearly 69,000 backers.In the grand scheme of things, those are minuscule numbers. Great for a startup like Pebble, but in retrospect maybe not an indicator that consumers in general were ready to embrace the new product category.Add in the challenge of fitness tracker companies that refuse to give up.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) was squarely in the crosshairs of the Apple Watch. Instead of rolling over, Fitbit released a new generation of trackers, some of which incorporate key smartwatch functionality. Namely, notifications.With consumers more interesting in tracking their health and fitness than paying a considerable premium to run apps on their wrist,Fitbit's sales have defied predictions and continued to grow.How to Trade Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock AFTER     EarningsMeanwhile, the smartwatch market is tanking.IDC's numbers for the third quarter showsmartwatch sales down by 51.6% compared to last year. Pebble - the early pioneer - saw its sales drop 54% to only 100,000 units. What's particularly telling about that number is that it still allowed Pebble to place in the top five worldwide … AAPL took a beating with its sales off by 71.6%, a miserable performance only topped(?) byLenovo(OTCMKTS:LNVGY), which dropped by a whopping 73.3% compared to last year.The two bright spots in the smartwatch market wereGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Garmin has managed to position itself as the smartwatch maker of choice for runners, leveraging that strategy to a huge 324.2% sales growth and second place in the smartwatch market. Third place Samsung saw 9% growth.Can Apple Watch Sales Recover?The big question is whether these poor sales results indicate the air has come out of the smartwatch market altogether, or if they're more cyclical.Smartwatch sales have never lived up to expectations. When the Apple Watch was first released, some ""conservative"" estimatespredicted sales in the 36 million rangefor the first year. Instead, AAPL sold roughly 12 million. Maybe the air was never really there in the first place.On the other hand, during the last quarter, the smartwatch models available for purchase were largely older models, with new versions expected soon. The Apple Watch Series 2 was only available for several weeks of Q3, so its sales don't really come into play. Pebble faced the same issue, with the new Pebble 2 arriving late in the quarter. Meanwhile,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) delayed releasing its Android Wear 2.0 operating system, resulting in some vendors holding off on releasing their new smartwatches. Samsung announced the new Gear 3, but it is not yet for sale.So consumers may have been holding off, waiting for the new products to arrive.What has become obvious is that despite the initial hype, the smartwatch market is unlikely to reach the mass market adoption levels of the smartphone. As pointed out by IDC, ""It has also become evident that at present smartwatches are not for everyone.""How Apple Inc. (AAPL) HomeKit Protects Against     DDoS AttacksPrice cuts of the original Apple Watch (now the Series 1), the arrival of the Series 2 and a renewed focus on health and fitness tracking should help Apple Watch sales bounce back in Q4. It seems likely to hold its lead as top dog in the smartwatch market for a while yet.However, it seems increasingly doubtful that the Apple Watch is going to be AAPL's next big smash hit. A steady revenue generator, sure, but not the next iPhone.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIBM Shocker: Switching to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm, Inc. Reportedly to Tap Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. for Snapdragon 830;10/25/2016;"Image source: Qualcomm.Beginning with its Snapdragon 820 high-end smartphone   processor,Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) began having its high-end smartphone processors   manufactured atSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) in a high-profile shift away fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) .makeArticleAd();Qualcomm is also expected to tap Samsung for the manufacture   of its next generation premium applications processor known as   Snapdragon 830. The Snapdragon 830 is expected to be built using   Samsung's recently announced 10-nanometer LPE technology.Interestingly, per a report from China-based publication   Economic Daily News (viaDigiTimes), Qualcomm may be planning to shift ""follow-up orders"" for the   Snapdragon 830 from Samsung to TSMC as production of the   Snapdragon 830 has ""reportedly fallen behind schedule.""Production falling behind schedule wouldn't be     surprisingAlthough Samsung made a big splash recently with its press   releasesayingthat it's now mass producing chips on its 10-nanometer LPE   process, such a schedule slip wouldn't come as a surprise (if the   report is accurate).For one thing, Samsung may have taken an immature,   low-yielding manufacturing process and thrown it into the   production facilities to meet both Qualcomm's and Samsung   Mobile's aggressive product release schedules (new Galaxy S   series smartphones, as well as other flagship mobile devices,   usually launch in the spring).If that's the case, Qualcomm might be finding itself with a   lot of chips coming off the line either dead (low functional   yield) or with chips that simply don't meet performance   specification (also known as parametric yields) and are thus are   unsuitable for sale.Indeed, generally reliable mobile supply chain analyst   Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities reported (viaMacRumors) that yield issues on Samsung's 10-nanometer process is one   reason that Samsung may not ""rush"" the Galaxy S8 series   smartphones to market.Where does TSMC fit in?Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business brought in   about $2.67 billion in revenue, perIC Insights, during 2015 while TSMC's grew to more than $26 billion in that   time. TSMC is far and away the market leader in contract chip   manufacturing, and I believe that this massive revenue base   relative to Samsung Foundry (and any other of its contract chip   manufacturing peers, for that matter) allows it to be more   aggressive about investing in research and development for future   technologies.Although I don't think TSMC's 10-nanometer yields right now   are anything to write home about (on its most recent earnings   call, management said that the first product to be built on its   10-nanometer technology has been ""produced with reasonable yield""   -- not the wording one would expect if yields were great), I   strongly suspect that TSMC is further along on this front than   Samsung is.What Qualcomm may have done is implemented Snapdragon 830 in   both Samsung's and TSMC's 10-nanometer processes, respectively.   Qualcomm clearly has incentive to build the first Snapdragon 830   chips at Samsung as the former is eager to get its chips inside   of the latter's flagship Galaxy S series smartphones.Later on in the Snapdragon 830's life cycle, though, Qualcomm   could dual-source the chips, ultimately selling Samsung-built   Snapdragon 830 chips to Samsung and some mix of Samsung- and   TSMC-built Snapdragon 830 chips to other flagship Android phone   makers.In this case, winning some of the Snapdragon 830 orders would   be a win for TSMC, since it was completely shut out of the   Snapdragon 820/821 generation.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

With the Galaxy Note 7 Off Shelves, Who Stands to Win Market Share?;10/25/2016;"WithSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 line being pulled from   shelves, which consumer tech companies might benefit?Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) new Pixel phone looks like it   could win over some burned Note 7 customers, but the search giant   lacks meaningful carrier distribution.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA,   discuss the fallout from the Note 7 recall and the smartphone   market at-large.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock     price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know     investors! To be one of them,just click here.This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of   potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat   recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table   bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going   to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for   Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google   here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a   slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them   isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly   interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are   specifically in some of these devices and not others. But   big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick   with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might   pick up some incremental business here.Evan Niu:Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of   course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole   thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally,   to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this   is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing.   It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people   that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the   Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock   Android without all the third-party software and all this   stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms   of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL   or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about   distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in   the way that most companies in the space do.   They're partnering withVerizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that,   they're selling it online through the online store. But,   it might surprise you how many people, when they need a   new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the   retail store.Lewis:It becomes kind of a default decision, right?Niu:Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's   where they have the most selection, they can deal with all   their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things   online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier   distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone   maker. People that already know which phone they want   they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of   people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like   any other product in their lives, versus people like you and   me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's   just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of   people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade,   they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For   the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not   going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves.   It's harder for Google to get these carrier   relationships going, because the carriers want more control.   It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never   been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I   think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is   their lack of distribution.Lewis:It sounds like the rundown for investors here is,   Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that   might really see some importance swings in what goes on with   their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like   you talked about,Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to   keep the bad PR and negative brand association   contained to the Note line, then this won't be something   that's really awful for them long term. If it does start to bleed   into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like   that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a   long time.Niu:Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is   going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone   next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis   altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it   out, there's reason to think that there might be another   one.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know   exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might   see a nice rally in Samsung sales.Niu:They can't replicate this in their labs!   It's just crazy.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Alphabet (A shares), Apple, and Verizon     Communications.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Will Samsung's Note 7 Fiasco Hurt Facebook's VR Efforts?;10/24/2016;"Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recently discontinued the  Note 7 phablet   after replacement units for the original device, which overheated   and caught fire several times, were found to have the same flaws.   Macquarie analyst Daniel Kim estimates that the debacle could   result in 3.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) in losses during   Samsung's fourth quarter, which would likely wipe out the entire   mobile division's quarterly profits.Gear VR. Image source: Samsung.makeArticleAd();The damage to Samsung is obvious, but the Note 7 fiasco could   also hurtFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus VR. That's because the Note 7 was one of   the few Samsung devices that worked with the Gear VR headset,   which was co-developed with Oculus and tethered to Facebook's   Oculus Home ecosystem. In response to the Note 7's   discontinuation, Oculus recently disabled the  Gear VR app   on those handsets.The Gear VR is expected to reach a wider mainstream audience   than higher-end VR headsets like the Oculus Rift andHTCVive, since it has a lower price tag and doesn't require a   high-end gaming PC. Could Samsung's big blunder also impact Gear   VR sales this year and in turn throttle the expansion of the   Oculus Home ecosystem? Let's crunch the numbers to find out.A closer look at the Gear VRSamsung offered the Gear VR, which usually costs $99, for free   in various promotions to customers who purchased the S7, S7 Edge,   and  Note 7 earlier this year. The Gear VR is also   compatible with older flagship devices like the Note 5, S6, and   S6 Edge.SuperData estimates that the Gear VR will have an install base   of about 2.3 million by  the end of this year, making it the   second most popular VR headset afterSony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation VR, which is expected to hit 2.6   million.Facebook is only expected to sell 360,000 Oculus Rifts. That   anemic interest was confirmed by a recent Steam survey, which   found that a mere 0.1% of the  respondents owned a Rift. As   a result, Facebook will still depend heavily on Samsung's devices   to expand Oculus Home's reach for the foreseeable future.Oculus Home on the Rift. Image source: Oculus VR.Gauging the Note 7 impactBack in August, Hyundai Securities estimated that shipments of   the Note 7 could hit  12 million this year. Meanwhile,   Daishin Securities estimated that Samsung could sell up to 25   million S7 and S7 Edge devices this  year. Based on those   estimates, we can assume that Note 7 users would have accounted   for about a third of the new Gear VR-compatible user base by the   end of the year.But that doesn't necessarily mean that the Note 7's demise   will reduce Gear VR sales by a third. Many Note 7 customers   already received the Gear VR as a free gift that they can still   use with other flagship devices. Sales estimates for the S7 and   S7 Edge could also rise as the Note 7 disappears, in spite of   the reputation-beating the brand has taken. Lastly, users of   older flagship devices who don't own a Gear VR yet might buy the   headset this holiday season without buying a new phone.Therefore, I believe that the Note 7's failure should just be   a bump in the road for the Gear VR, and probably won't cause the   headset to fall behind its pricier PC-based rivals.What does this all mean for Facebook?This whole incident reveals how much Facebook still depends on   Samsung in the VR market. Facebook needs Oculus Home to reach   more users, because it retains a 30% cut on all VR content sales.   This next-gen app store is basically Facebook's forward-thinking   answer toAlphabet's Google Play.Without Gear VR, Oculus Home would have a hard time gaining   momentum outside the Rift's core demographic of affluent,   hardcore-gaming early adopters. However, Samsung and Facebook   could soon face tough competition in the mobile VR space when   Google's Daydream, a similar VR ecosystem, arrives on more   Android devices.Since Daydream is essentially a VR expansion for Google Play,   it could marginalize Oculus Home out of the mobile market by   spreading to Samsung devices. The companion headset, the Daydream   View, is also cheaper than the Gear VR at  $79.The key takeawayThe real danger to Facebook's VR ambitions isn't the Note 7's   fiery flop. It's the company's dependence on Samsung to retain a   foothold in the higher-growth mobile VR market. Google is trying   to drive a wedge between the two companies with Daydream. If it   succeeds, Facebook could find it very difficult to expand its   Oculus Home ecosystem without the backing of a major mobile OS   like Android.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good.Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about   the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host,   Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech   specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?Evan Niu:It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a   longtime Samsung skeptic.Lewis:We're bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been   comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not   going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right?Niu:It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone   blowing up.Lewis:On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's   been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last   month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone   segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which   companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and   the recall of the Galaxy Note line.Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little   timeline on what's been going on?Niu:Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part   of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market   on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in   September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the   timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible   to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly,   because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference   could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung.   I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they   cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just   weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we   started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or   catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In   general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When   you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that   can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official   chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be   using.So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They   think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced   in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they   do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that   have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start   replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or   two, the replacement phones are now catching on   fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now   they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether.   That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this   bad.It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take   this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about   an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in   years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated   incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking   about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing   happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably   thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they   haven't. It's kind of crazy.Lewis:Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I   think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically   coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed   like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the   smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to   go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance.   So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the   financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the   company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating   profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is   roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8   trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there.   Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now   expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous   guidance of 49 trillion won.Niu:I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is,   Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They   cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New   York Times report that their engineers are still trying to   replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot   of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get   the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it.   But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question   mark. It really calls to question all these other things about   their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had   this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure   this out and definitively say, ""This is what caused it, and we   have a solution ... ""This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had   washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw   that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung   makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines,   and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different   thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the   phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with   everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too?Lewis:To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons   why this is a little bit different than your average product   recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen   withChipotleorJack in the Boxin the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to   diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence   in the other products they have out there.I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion   in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering,   frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They   intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to   keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're   seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and   which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I   forget which product, but it was one of their newer and   higher-priced phones, that --Niu:It was the regular S7.Lewis:Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people   who held those in their hands, if they were reading this   notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but   when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the   headlines are ""Galaxy 7,"" and they're trying to distill it down   to something like that ...Niu:Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as   closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy   something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7   A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all   part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into   building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this   brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly   botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not   uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing,   advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that,   than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and   now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down.   They're trying to contain this thing, like you said,   notifications saying, ""Your phone is safe."" It sounds exactly   like the phone is not safe. But, ""The phone is safe, don't   worry.""Lewis:I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and   returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life   cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast   casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via   coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in   restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine   purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone   every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the   likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry   there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones,   or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to   the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're   second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might   decide to go over to something on the iOS side.Niu:Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung   is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the   past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have   to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications   and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to   differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually   good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're   really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is   having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to   buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been   incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one   strength is now being called into question ...Lewis:People are going to go elsewhere.Niu:Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's   tons of really good Android phones out there.Lewis:I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is   offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other   Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save   some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising   to see some flight from the brand.One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the   timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season,   and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics.   To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter   where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at   least ...Niu:And one of their most expensive, most profitable products,   too.Lewis:Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a   business.Niu:Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes   all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their   flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the   iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's   bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has   established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has   the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't   have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty   comparable, as far as giant phones go.Lewis:Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was   expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It   looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about   15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that   into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million   and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this   is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying   to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their   product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I   don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize.Niu:I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes   from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like   India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making   a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps   them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you   mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a   non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those   are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones --   that's where these companies make their margins. I think it   has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms   of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating   profits.Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's   business, in terms of revenue and operating profit,   roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of   things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment   itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile   segment if you look at the margin profile within their   mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in   terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of   volume, but considering that Samsung is largely   a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to   someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to   their platform like Google or Apple would be.   They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't   have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think,   again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for   the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on   right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger   thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if   it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's   lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a   long time.Lewis:I think that's why you've seen market reaction to   this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take   the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we   look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the   volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've   seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this   story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or   5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this   is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines.   They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If   those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of   the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a   little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the   different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an   idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of   revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT   and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over   50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and   display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is   the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a   high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price),   being removed, might lead to some margin compression there.   But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this   muted reaction from the market makes sense.Niu:Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they   can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think   it's a good thing to kill those phones,   definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on.   You have to bite the bullet.Lewis:Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit   briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as   Samsung goes into crisis mode.But before we do, what if you could help combat   global climate change, and make money at the same time?

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good.So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of   the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some   consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe   they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity   to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android   device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with   this?Niu:I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start   with the loser list, I think it's a little bit   shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in   terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated   that it makes most of the components that go to its phones.   It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as   far as supply relationships go that might suffer from   reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung   itself.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820   is inside the U.S. variants --Lewis:Can you explain what the Snapdragon does?Niu:Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has   integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most   important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what   they do is they have all these different variants   for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to   ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year,   they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this   year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix,   they've improved their chips a little bit and got more   competitive. There's some variance for different   geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll   lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be   selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a   hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If   people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably   incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out   of the picture.Lewis:Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy.Niu:Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a   silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you   get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in   the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive   modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has   gone toIntel-- well, first time not   including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year,   Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and   Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure   winners, I would say certainly Apple.Lewis:Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products   issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly   seems to think --Niu:Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now   the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016   highs because of all this stuff that's going on with   Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people   are probably going to try. And we've already been   seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every   quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter   they're like, ""highest Android switcher rates ever."" I   think that trend is going to continue, particularly   with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall   here.As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So   Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with   their modem, they benefit.Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) , I think, is a big winner here too.   They actually just released earnings that were pretty   strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10   Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior   years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip   manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan   Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only   brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But   now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're   getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for   them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry   business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more   chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They   just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in   above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the   important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor   raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised   guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other   phones being discontinued. So they were already super   bullish, even before factoring in the Note   7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think   they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple   sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make   these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a   pretty big winner here.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the   commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into   the iPhone as a general baseline for how that   segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're   seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably   bodes well for the iPhone business.Niu:Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what   blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they   literally said, ""This does not include any impact if the   Note 7 is discontinued,"" which it has been. So, it looks   really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or   retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent.   They're just trying to do their best to help their   customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going   to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of   cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this.   So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's   right for the customer and get these things off the market. I   don't think there's going to be any damage to them.Lewis:I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as   well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they   released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major   potential competitor off the table bodes well for people   giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that   meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think,   when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung   falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of   the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's   thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the   component manufacturers that are specifically in some of   these devices and not others. But big picture, if you   like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy   solely on the idea that they might pick up   some incremental business here.Niu:Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course,   it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing.   They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC.   But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first   time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks   like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that   are not getting the Note 7 might consider the   Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock   Android without all the third-party software and all this   stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms   of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL   or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about   distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in   the way that most companies in the space do.   They're partnering withVerizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that,   they're selling it online through the online store. But,   it might surprise you how many people, when they need a   new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the   retail store.Lewis:It becomes kind of a default decision, right?Niu:Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where   they have the most selection, they can deal with all their   plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I   think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an   incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People   that already know which phone they want they'll just go and   buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and   they still like to shop around, like any other product in   their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so   loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I   going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their   phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to   the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other   than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google   is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get   these carrier relationships going, because the carriers   want more control. It's harder for Google to   negotiate because they've never been a big player in   the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing   that's going to hold them back is their lack of   distribution.Lewis:It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple,   Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might   really see some importance swings in what goes on with their   numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you   talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is,   for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR   and negative brand association contained to the Note   line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them   long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products   they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell   trouble for their mobile segment for a long time.Niu:Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going   on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next   year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering,   two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's   reason to think that-there might be another one.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly   what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see   a nice rally in Samsung sales.Niu:They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just   crazy.Lewis:Anything else before I let you go, Evan?Niu:No, I think we hit it all.Lewis:Awesome. Well, listeners, that does it for this episode   ofIndustry Focus.

Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Debacle Could Hurt Best Buy's Momentum;10/23/2016;"Earlier this month,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) finally pulled the plug on its Galaxy Note 7   phone, after failing to fix battery-related problems that caused   some phones to spontaneously catch fire. Samsung is now recalling   all Galaxy Note 7 phones at great cost to itself. It expects the   total cost of discontinuing and recalling the Note 7 to be at   least $5.3 billion.Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 could have been a big seller. Image   source: Samsung.makeArticleAd();However, Samsung may not be the only casualty from this   scandal. Samsung's retail partners will also share in the pain   without the Galaxy Note 7 to drive sales this fall.Best Buy(NYSE: BBY) could be particularly hard hit.It could have been a huge successUpon its initial release two months ago, the Samsung Galaxy   Note 7 won high praise from pundits. The Verge called it   ""Samsung'sbest device ever, and arguably the best big phone ever made.""In an environment where smartphone sales have been hurt by   lengthening replacement cycles, the Galaxy Note 7 was compelling   enough to spark upgrades. Now that it's out of the picture, fewer   people may choose to buy a new phone this fall. Furthermore,   early adopters of the Galaxy Note 7 might just go back to using   their previous devices rather than trading in their recalled   phone for a newApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) or Android device.Back in August, Best Buy's management raised its full-year   operating income guidance and projected that revenue would return   to growth in the back half of the year. Improving phone sales   were a critical piece of that forecast. Samsung's inability to   solve the Galaxy Note 7's battery problems will weigh on Best   Buy's sales in the second half of the fiscal year.Gains by Apple won't help Best BuyBest Buy is particularly exposed to Samsung's fortunes in the   smartphone market because it has opened hundreds of Samsung   Experience Shops within its Best Buy stores since 2013. These   shops, which offer more Samsung-specific product expertise than   other retailers, have probably helped Best Buy snag a hefty share   of Samsung device sales.Thus, to the extent that consumers switch away from Samsung to   other high-end smartphone manufacturers, they may be less likely   to buy their new devices at Best Buy.Best Buy has opened numerous Samsung mini-shops within its   stores. Image source: The Motley Fool.If Apple capitalizes on Samsung's miscue, it could be even   worse for Best Buy. Apple offers third-party retailers like Best   Buy notoriously slim margins on the iPhone. Thus, retailers can   rack up a lot of revenue from selling iPhones, but unless they   can get buyers to pick up high-margin accessories or make other   purchases, they won't be making much of a profit.The recall could be costlyFinally, Best Buy is likely to incur elevated costs related to   the Galaxy Note 7 recall. All of the Galaxy Note 7 devices that   Best Buy has sold in the past two months are now going to be   returning to Best Buy stores.Processing these returns will use valuable labor, either   pulling employees away from their main job (selling products) or   forcing Best Buy to increase staffing. It's not clear whether it   will get any compensation from Samsung for its trouble.An untimely setbackBest Buy stock has rallied since August, approaching its late   2013 high. Best Buy's better-than-expected Q2 financial   performance has fueled optimism that the consumer electronics   giant can thrive despite the rise of e-commerce.Best Buy Stock Performance data byYCharts.However, it facesa new challengefromJ.C. Penneyin the appliance market, a key source of sales growth for Best   Buy lately. Meanwhile, the consumer electronics market as a whole   has been shrinking recently, partially driven by price   deflation.These days, Best Buy has to work hard just to generate modest   sales and profit growth. Apple devices aren't the reliable growth   drivers they were just a few years ago. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7   could have provided a nice sales and profit boost for Best Buy   this fall. Instead, it has become one more headwind for Best Buy   to overcome.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Reasons Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Hitting Record Highs … Again;10/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCongratulations to anyone who's been a long-term investor ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG and GOOGL shares reached new all-time highs this week despite a market-wide headwind of late. GOOG stock's up 23% for the last twelve months, and is still forging its way deeper into uncharted waters.Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)The credit for the latest round of bullishness was largely given to the company's new so-called Pixel smartphone.makeArticleAd();And, it's admittedly an impressive device that was fortuitously unveiled right around the same time rivalSamsung Electronic KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) announced it wastaking its Galaxy Note 7 off the market due to a dangerous design flaw.To understand why GOOG stock seems to repeatedly prompt this ""new 52-week"" high story though, one has to take a step back and look at the company through a more philosophical lens. There are three big reasons Alphabet Inc is one of only a few truly must-have stocks.In no particular order:GOOGL Is Still a Primary Web-GatekeeperWith just a quick glance at some of the data, it would be easy to conclude Google - and by extension, Alphabet Inc - is perpetually en-route to weaker results. The amount of revenue it collects every time someone clicks on one of its ads has beensteadily sinking since 2012, largely reflecting the rise of smartphones, where text and banner ads aren't as fruitful.16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Donald     TrumpThe flipside of that trend is that what GOOGL may have lost in pricing power it has more than made up for in sheer volume. During the second quarter of this year, while its cost-per-click was down another 7%, the number of total clicks it induces was up 29% on a year-over-year basis. The downtrend in cost-per-click values simply reflects the commoditization of an internet-ad market that's still rapidly growing.And GOOG is winning a share of that market as it migrates away from computers and toward handheld devices. As of the second quarter of this year, Alphabet Inc's Android operating system was on arecord-breaking 87.6% of smartphones shipped that quarter.That OS is essentially free to users since it's more valuable to GOOGL as a platform to sell other products, like ads and apps.Alphabet Inc's Innovations ImproveCalling a spade a spade, while the Nexus line of smartphones thatfirst debuted in 2010(positioned as a Google product, but actually made by HTC) was a respectable player in a tough arena, none of its iterations were truly a match for the far more popular iPhone series, fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). As yours truly has mentioned more than once over the years though, it's only a matter of time before competitors meaningfully copy a proven technology.Enter the Pixel smartphone, from GOOG.The reviews are in, and thesmartphone experts love it- even the ones who usually love to love the iPhone and love to hate Google. It may well have the very best camera ever put on board a smartphone, and the built-in Google Assistant takes dead aim at Apple's Siri. It's being (legitimately) posed as a potential iPhone killer.Here's the thing … it's not just the smartphone that Alphabet Inc tweaked and tweaked until it came up with something awesome: That's how it sees and treats many of its products and services.GOOG Is Not Afraid to Enter New ArenasBack in 2012, when GOOGL first started to lay its own fiberoptic cables to deliver super-high-speed internet services to select cities, some felt the company was wasting time and money. Broadband was already ubiquitous. It was never about operating a profitable ISP though. The investment wasmore of a message to existing internet service providersto step up their game and offer a service that ultimately benefits Alphabet Inc (and boost the value of GOOG stock) in other ways.However, it's not just fiberoptic service - just as it's not a smartphone for the sake of selling smartphones.GOOGL is working on several seemingly unrelated and unfruitful projects, including drones, self-driving cars and even medical technology, perhaps without even knowing fully where those efforts are headed. It simply knows the future won't look like the present, and there's value in preparing for multiple contingencies.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a     Long-Term PowerhouseCase in point? While the Google Chromecast television-watching tool was always interesting, it was never especially well-received relative to Apple TV or the Roku.

3 Big Stock Charts: KB Home (KBH), Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY) and Depomed Inc (DEPO);10/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsThe market is set to move sideways after hitting its first   streak of two day wins for October. Traders will be eyeing theS&P 500at 2,140, as this is a key support level for the market. A break   above this level will give stocks a boost. Meanwhile,Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings results are casting a shadow on the tech sector, but   not enough that we're not finding plentiful opportunities among   the technology sector. Remember, tech stocks are the strongest   group for performance from October through December each   year.Today's Big Stock Charts examinesKB Home(NYSE:KBH) andCypress Semiconductor Corporation(NASDAQ:CY) as stocks that are being affected by sector news. In addition,   we take a look atDepomed Inc(NASDAQ:DEPO), which is drawing an interesting short-term pattern that   suggests that traders will be able to grab DEPO shares at   lower prices within the next few weeks.makeArticleAd();KB Home (KBH)Housing data continues to show a decline in the market that is   tricking down, or up as it would be, to homebuilders like KB   Home. KBH shares have been trading in a range between $15.50 and   $16.50 for the last three-months with the occasional dip below   the $15 range here and there.Furthermore, KB Home stock has been trading with a lower   valuation and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13, leading some   investors to believe that KBH stock is a ""deal"", but that is   not the case if the price is preparing to break down.16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Hillary       ClintonThe recent consolidation has started to roll over a bit,   flashing a warning sign of lower prices as it has caused a   decline in momentum. The kicker here will be the next move below   $15.50.A move below this ""trigger price"" will see KB Home shares move   to the $14.50 price point on an increase in selling volume based   on the momentum for the stock building to the downside. This will   lead to another make-or-break scenario for the stock, as this is   the site of KBH shares' 20-month moving average. Simply put, a   move below this will offer a move to $14 before the end of the   year.Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY)Setting up for a short-term bounce, Cypress Semiconductor   shares are testing the same support levels used in June and July   this year. The recent decline in CY, blamed on theSamsung Electronic KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) disaster, has firmly pressed Cypress Semiconductor stock into   technical oversold territory. On this alone, CY stock is likely   to see a 10% to 20% rebound in short order.From a longer-term perspective, Cypress Semiconductor shares   maintain a bearish outlook because the shares are breaking   back below their 20-month moving average. But for the time being,   CY stock should see some support from short-term traders looking   to scalp quick returns.As it stands now, Cypress Semiconductor shares have 9% upside   potential with a target of $11.50 before they run into overhead   resistance.Depomed Inc (DEPO)Depomed shares have done a great job of building technical   strength and leading the market higher. DEPO shares are trading   30% higher year-to-date and more than 15% higher over the last   year. While the intermediate-term outlook for Depomed shares   remains positive, we're seeing a pattern develop that tells us   we'll see a chance to buy the shares at lower prices over the   next month or so.While DEPO stock is breaking below its short-term 20-day   moving average, its pattern is drawing a short-term   head-and-shoulders pattern with the neckline at the at the $4   price level. These patterns are interesting as they   show investors locking in profits after failing to rally   after hitting highs, which is what happened with Depomed shares   since peaking in early October.For now, traders should take a cue from a break below $24 that   DEPO will make a move to $22 where the shares then become a good   bullish pickup.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Elite Information Technology Stocks to       BuyThe 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Every       Retirement PortfolioThe post3 Big Stock Charts: KB Home (KBH), Cypress   Semiconductor Corporation (CY) and Depomed Inc (DEPO)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

This High-Growth Business Is a Massive Opportunity for Apple;10/18/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) depends heavily on the iPhone when it comes to   sales and earnings, but the services division is becoming an   increasingly important growth engine for the company. Both from a   quantitative and qualitative point of view, services could be a   powerful return driver for investors in Apple going forward.makeArticleAd();A huge and growing businessWhen looking at Apple's financial statements, the iPhone   generates the lion's share of revenue. The company made over $24   billion in sales from the iPhone during the third quarter of   fiscal 2016 (the quarter ended in June of this year), accounting   for a massive 57% of total revenue.However, services are rapidly gaining ground. The services   division includes revenue from the iTunes Store, the App Store,   Apple Pay, Apple Music, and other services. This business   generated almost $6 billion in sales last quarter, and it's now   the company's second-biggest division behind the iPhone,   accounting for nearly 14% of total revenue.To put these numbers in perspective,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) generated $6.2 billion in sales during the second   quarter of 2016, andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) has recently reported $2.1 billion in total   revenue for the third quarter of the year. This means that   Apple's services division is nearly as big as Facebook, and   almost three times bigger than Netflix.Even more importantly, the services division is firing on all   cylinders, with revenue growing 19% versus the third quarter in   fiscal 2015. The App Store was a particularly strong driver last   quarter, with revenue growing 37% year over year. Apple produced   $23.1 billion from the services business in the 12-month period   ended in June, up by $4 billion during the past year. According   to management, the services segment is on track to becoming the   size of a Fortune 100 company next year.In stark contrast, revenue from the iPhone and the Mac   contracted by 23% and 13% respectively, and iPad sales grew by a   modest 7% year over year last quarter. This means that services   are outgrowing the rest of the business and gaining participation   in the overall revenue mix.Hardware sales are typically quite volatile, as they depend on   new product launches and other product-cycle considerations.   Performance in the iPhone business could easily improve going   forward, especially since Apple launched its new iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus models in September, and the company could   materially benefit fromSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) discontinuing the Galaxy Note 7.Nevertheless, even if other segments will probably improve in   the coming quarters, everything indicates that the services   segment will continue outgrowing other businesses over the   midterm, and this should have a positive impact on overall   revenue growth.Apple does not disclose profit margins for specific business   segments, but services are typically more profitable than product   sales. Based on data for 2015, investment bank Piper Jaffray   estimates that Apple's gross margin in services could be above   60%, substantially higher than the gross profit margin that Apple   typically makes on a whole-company level (it's in the   neighborhood of 40%).Beyond the numbersOne of the main uncertainty factors affecting Apple is lack of   growth visibility. Hardware companies are typically valued at   considerable discounts versus the overall market because demand   in the industry is quite unstable and cyclical. Besides, the   iPhone market is maturing and market penetration levels are much   higher than in the past, so Apple can't be expected to generate   from the iPhone the same kind of performance it produced when the   device was still an emerging technology.Services are a whole different story, though. Revenue in this   segment depends on the size of the installed base, not so much on   product sales over a particular quarter. For this reason, it   makes sense to expect a smoother growth trajectory from Apple in   services than in other business segments related to product   sales.In addition, services play a key role from a competitive   perspective. As customers become entrenched in Apple's ecosystem   of services and applications, they are more likely to remain   loyal to the company's products. If you are actively engaged with   Apple Pay and Apple Music, chances are you will go for another   iPhone when it's time to replace your smartphone.The iPhone will most probably remain Apple's biggest segment   over the coming quarters, but the services division is growing at   full speed and gaining participation in the overall revenue mix.   This is not only important from a quantitative perspective, but a   larger share of revenue and profits coming from services would   make overall financial performance more stable and easier to   predict going forward. Investors in Apple have a lot to gain if   the company can sustain rapid growth in the services business   over the years ahead.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

No, Apple Inc.'s OLED Plans Aren't on Hold;10/18/2016;"Image source: Getty.Over onSeeking Alpha(free membership required), contributor Nikhil Gupta offered up   some commentary around a recent article in Nikkei, particularly   as it relates toApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) display sourcing plans. The Nikkei piece   said that Foxconn and Sharp, the former having recently taken a   large equity stake in the latter, will begin mass production of   organic light emitting diode, or OLED, displays for smartphones   in 2019.makeArticleAd();Current Apple iPhones use liquid crystal displays, or LCDs,   but the iDevice maker is expected to be actively working to make   sure the technology and supplier infrastructure is in place for a   transition to OLED displays. Apple is expected to adopt OLED   technology on a premium model that sits above the 5.5-inch iPhone   Plus model in the company's 2017 product lineup, per aprevious reportfrom Nikkei.So what does this have to do with Gupta's comments? In his   article, he argues that ""with the recent fiasco ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, and with   reasons still unknown, Apple would not risk procuring OLED   displays from Samsung.""The implication, then, is that if Apple has to wait for   Foxconn and Sharp to get their act together in OLEDs, Apple's   plans to release a premium iPhone next year with an OLED display   may be in tatters.That's not going to happen; here's why.Displays don't explodeIt's very likely that the Galaxy Note7's issues are, in some   way, related to the batteries inside. After all, itisthe batteries that are exploding. The problem may not be due to   faulty battery packs themselves, but perhaps there is an issue   with the design of the phone and how it interacts with the   battery that caused those problems.I don't think it's reasonable to blame the display itself.Using Samsung-built displays should be fineThe reality of the situation is that Samsung Display is one of   the only companies, if not the only one, capable of building OLED   displays that can be used in high-volume smartphones today. Even   LG, a major manufacturer of displays, still uses LCDs in its   flagship smartphones -- thoughLG Display(NYSE: LPL) isreportedlymaking significant investments to enable a shift to flexible   OLEDs at some point.Not only should Apple be fine with using Samsung-built OLED   displays, but if Apple wants to ship an iPhone with an OLED   display during the second half of 2017, it might not have any   choice but to source -- at least initially -- from Samsung.Apple won't be tied to Samsung forever, thoughApple is unlikely to be happy to be tied to Samsung fortoolong, particularly given that the two companies are fierce   competitors in the world of smartphones. The iDevice maker is   surely going to work to enable other display manufactures, such   as Foxconn/Sharp, as well as longtime LCD supplier Japan Display,   to become important OLED display suppliers over time.Indeed, it's pretty telling that Apple reportedly plans on   only adopting a curved OLED display in a single ultra-premium   model rather than across the board. With so few viable suppliers   of mobile OLED displays today, the prices that Samsung can charge   are likely substantially higher than what Apple's mobile LCD   suppliers can.This means that from both a margin perspective, as well as   simply a supply availability perspective, Apple probably can't   transition its entire iPhone lineup to OLEDs until later on.Once all of the major mobile display vendors are able to   successfully produce mobile OLEDs to Apple's specifications,   pricing on mobile OLEDs should come down -- a positive for   display buyers such as Apple and a potential negative for   Samsung's mobile OLED margins and/or share at Apple for the   longer term -- though the market opportunity is likely to be much   larger as the supplier base grows.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Just for calendar year 2016, the stock is up 36%. This is happening despite the fact that the consensus on upcoming earnings is for a loss of7 cents per share.Hirai has been fighting against his company's own corporate culture, which made him keep ailing consumer electronics units well past their sell-by date, and the slow pace at which it responded tochanges in the market.Hirai sold some slow-moving lines and let go of 10,000 people, but has been unwilling to jettison its TV and mobile phone lines, which continue to drag on results.Hirai's Plan for SNE Stock Is SynergyHirai came from the company's video game unit, its one bright spot, representingnearly four-fifths of the company's profits.While rivalMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) works to tie its competing Xbox to the Windows operating system, Hirai's strategy is to tie his Playstation to other consumer products and services.9 Best Stocks to Buy Amid Market TurmoilSo instead of launching a streaming service, Sony launched Playstation Vue, a streaming servicewith gaming. The company has extended the hardware line with avirtual reality headset.Hirai chose not to sell the company's TV or phone lines, but the company is getting faster to market. Sony's latest TV is gettingstrong reviews, as is its latestpocket cameraand its latest phone is said to have impressive technology, a positive as Android makers look to take market share fromSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).Entertainment Grow or Sell?The bigger problem may be malaise in the company's Sony Pictures and television unit, which was number one in studio market share in 2012 witha 16.1% shareand is now down to number five with a 9.1% share.The studio had a winner last month withThe Magnificent Sevenand its big October release,Inferno, is hoping to earn $42 million this weekend, based on the past record of sequels.For 2017, SNE stock is moving ahead with a movieabout emojis, a live-action version of the Chinese tale of Mulan (dueling with another live-action version made byWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), which created the animated filmMulan)anda marketing partnershipwith China'sWanda Films, aimed at cracking that market.When will the company start mining its video game library for movie hits?

Apple Inc. Is Giving Siri a Helping Hand (AAPL);10/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its early lead with Siri slip as competing personal digital assistants get smarter. Its rivals have invested heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and that has paid off.Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashBut Apple hopes to rectify that, hiring its first director of AI research in a bid to boost Siri's capabilities.makeArticleAd();Siri Helped Take AI Mainstream, But Fell BehindApple didn't create Siri, but it did purchase its digital assistant as an app.Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) actually bought the latest AI company from the Siri developers, but that'sanother story.Once in the AAPL fold, Siri was baked into iOS and released in 2011 as a tentpole feature of the iPhone 4s. Since then, Apple has continued to improve the Siri experience and rolled it out to all its iOS devices, the Apple TV, Apple Watch and Mac computers. But those improvements have been incremental - Siri's capabilities haven't taken a great leap forward.As one of the early examples of mass market artificial intelligence, Siri did well, but AAPL's personal digital assistant has been falling behind.Apple CEO Stands Up for Gay Rights in the Work     PlaceRivalsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and especiallyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have invested heavily in AI, machine learning and the massive server infrastructure needed to support advancing the field.As a result, in the time since Siri first appeared, Apple's personal digital assistant has in many ways been left behind by the competition: Cortana, Alexa, Google Now and the latest, Google Assistant. Apple continues to set the standard in seamless integration, but the artificial intelligence advantage the others hold has begun to pay off with the ability to answer more complex questions and predictive capabilities.Google has really thrown down the gauntlet with its newPixel smartphone, which incorporates Google Assistant as a key, exclusive feature.Carnegie Mellon Professor Becomes Director of New AI TeamYesterday,Russ Salakhutdinov tweeted that he was joining Apple as a director of AI research. In the same tweet, he invited applications to work with his new team at AAPL. The job posting is for research scientists in machine learning with a PhD. The new AI director is clearly looking to assemble a high profile group.There are two significant points in this news.Apple obviously is ramping up its investment in   artificial intelligence. Less than two months ago,   AAPL made headlines for a machine learning acquisition   andformation of a devision with Apple dedicated to   the technology. It's not immediately clear how closely integrated the new AI   team will be with that machine learning division, but it only   makes sense that they will be working closely together.The second is the choice of Salakhutdinov to fill the   director of AI role. Based at Carnegie Mellon University -   recognized as being a leader in artificial intelligence research   - he specializes in neural networks and deep learning. AsCNETpoints out, his focus has led to being at the forefront ofresearch on enabling AI to learn from raw   data.Successfully applying this sort of artificial intelligence research to Siri could result in a super-charged personal digital assistant that leapfrogs the competition. Outside of Siri, there also are applications for Apple services. For example, song recommendations based on user listening patterns on Apple Music.Bottom LineApple's hire of Salakhutdinov is a signal that it's serious about artificial intelligence. The payoff for Siri is that Apple is laying the groundwork to make the leap from being the company that took personal digital assistants mainstream, to being the company with the ""smartest.""That would be more than bragging rights - it would be a key selling point to help move more iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs and Apple Watches.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAmazon.com, Inc.

Samsung Announces 10-Nanometer Production, Lags Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.;10/17/2016;"Image source: Samsung.In a press release on Oct. 17,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) announced that it had begun mass production of   its first system-on-chip based on its 10-nanometer LPE (""low   power early"") technology. The company boasts that this technology   delivers an ""up to 30% increase in area efficiency with   27-percent higher performance or 40-percent lower power   consumption.""makeArticleAd();Although this press release might initially be viewed as a   positive for Samsung, it really demonstrates how behind its main   competitor --Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd(NYSE: TSM)  -- Samsung is.Less than a full generation shrinkNotice that Samsung claims that its 10-nanometer process   delivers ""up to a 30% increase in area efficiency"" -- that's far   less than the typical 50% shrink that a new manufacturing   generation is supposed to bring. I suspect that Samsung   sacrificed area scaling in order to hit a more aggressive rollout   schedule.TSMC, in contrast, is claiming that its own 10-nanometer   technology delivers a 0.52x scaling factor relative to its   prior generation 16-nanometer FinFET technology (viaEETimes). The company says its 10-nanometer process will generate   revenue in the first quarter of 2017 -- likely in support ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)A10X chip.Although TSMC's 16-nanometer technology was slightly less   dense than Samsung's 14-nanometer technology to begin with, TSMC   should still wind up with its 10-nanometer technology solidly   ahead on this front relative to Samsung's using the gate pitch   times minimum metal pitch metric (a common proxy for process   density).Company14/16nm Density (nm^2)10nm Density (nm^2)Samsung4992~3494TSMC5760~2995Source: Various.Technology gap further widens in a yearSamsung also said in its press release that its next stop   after 10-nanometer LPE would be a process technology known as   10-nanometer LPP -- a higher performance version of its   10-nanometer technology. Although performance should improve,   there is unlikely to be any area/cost reduction.In contrast, TSMC is planning for mass production on its   7-nanometer manufacturing technology in early 2018. TSMC's   7-nanometer technology isn't expected to deliver a full   generation area shrink relative to its 10-nanometer process, but   the company is saying that it expects 7-nanometer to deliver   1.63x the density of its 10-nanometer technology (viaEETimes).It would appear that when performance, power consumption, and   area are all factored in, TSMC will open up a lead over Samsung   that could very well be permanent.TSMC's confidence not surprising... for     SamsungOn a prior earnings call, TSMC claimed that during the   10-nanometer generation, it would capture more than 70% market   share. Then,recently, TSMC's executives said that at the 7-nanometer generation, the   company expects to enjoy share ""higher than"" what it's predicting   for the 10-nanometer generation. I expect TSMC's lead in   terms of technology to be a critical factor in achieving these   share goals.TSMC's confidence doesn't exactly bode well for Samsung's   efforts, considering that it is currently TSMC's only viable   competition at leading edge manufacturing technologies in the   world of contract chip manufacturing.Samsung's future as a foundry looks     questionableOver the long term, I have serious doubts that Samsung will   continue to invest in trying to be a leading-edge logic   semiconductor manufacturer. According to IC Insights (via   EETimes), Samsung is expected to generate just $2.79 billion in   revenue from its contract chip manufacturing efforts.TSMC is, according to analyst consensus, on track to hit   nearly $29 billion in sales this year -- more than an order of   magnitude greater than Samsung's contract chip revenue.Assuming a gross profit margin of 40% and an annual research   development budget related to these efforts of about $1 billion   (half that of TSMC's), Samsung's foundry business would barely be   breaking even. Barring a substantial uptick in revenue, the   increasing research and development intensity that this business   necessitates may simply make it an unattractive one to the   company longer-term.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

178 Billion Reasons to Buy Apple;10/15/2016;"Image source: The Motley Fool.According to the recently released 2016 Best Global Brands   Ranking from Interbrand,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuable brand in the world, with an   estimated market value of $178 billion. These kinds of rankings   and value estimates are always a matter of discussion, but it's   hard to argue the fact that Apple is world-class brand, and this   has important implications for investors in the company.makeArticleAd();The value of a brandInvesting in companies with strong brand value can be a   powerful strategy for superior returns over the long term. When a   company has a differentiated brand, this means customers are   willing to buy that company's products over products from the   competition offering a similar price and quality. This protects   the business from competitive pressure, and it can also mean   above-average pricing power, which has a positive effect on the   company's profit margins.Interbrand implements a holistic approach that includes both   quantitative financial data and subjective considerations for   valuing a brand. Financial analysis incorporates variables such   as after-tax operating profits, minus a charge for the capital   used to generate the brand's revenue and margins. Interbrand also   includes other aspects such as the portion of the purchase   decision attributable to the brand, as opposed to factors like   price and product features. When it comes to measuring brand   strength, the consulting firm also evaluates the brand's ability   to to create loyalty and sustained demand in the future.On the other hand, the Forbes Brand Ranking puts more weight   on financial considerations than Interbrand. According to Forbes:   ""We measure the value of a brand by looking at the financials   instead of fuzzy consumer surveys. The most valuable brands are   ones that generate significant earnings in industries where   branding plays a major role.""Forbes also considers Apple the most valuable brand in the   world, with a calculated value of $154 billion. Interestingly,   both Interbrand and Forbes put competitorAlphabet's Google(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) brand in the second   position among global brands. Interbrand estimates that the   Google brand is worth $133 billion, while Forbes has a more   conservative valuation of $82.5 billion for Google.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is another top player in the industry, even if   the company is facing a massive blow after theSamsung Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which will probably take a considerable toll on Samsung's brand   value. Interband puts Samsung in the seventh global position,   with an estimated value of $51.8 billion. When it comes to the   Forbes Brand Ranking, Samsung is ranked in the 11th place, with a   brand value calculated at $36.1 billion.How brand value benefits investors in AppleThe consumer electronics industry is notoriously challenging   and competitive, and most companies in the sector operate with   razor-thin profit margins. Global smartphone demand is slowing   down thanks to market saturation across the world, and research   firm IDC has recently cut its growth forecast for the industry to   an anemic increase of 1.6% in shipments during 2016. In this   context, many smartphone manufacturers are aggressively cutting   prices to protect market share, which is hurting profit margins   across the board.However, you wouldn't have guessed that by looking at Apple.   Even if the company is facing declining revenue, the business   still generates enormous profitability for investors during   challenging times. According to data fromMorningstar, Apple produced an operating profit margin around 28.5% of   revenue during the 12-month period ended in June of 2016. This is   more than double the 12.8% operating margin produced by Samsung   in the same period, and the profitability gap will probably   increase over the coming months because of the problems Samsung   is facing with the Galaxy Note 7.Based on data from financial services company Cannacord   Genuity, Apple captured a staggering 75% of all operating profits   in the smartphone industry during the second quarter of 2016.   This is in spite of the fact that the company accounted for a   relatively small 11.7 % smartphone unit sales during the period.   Because Apple launched the new iPhone 7 in September, and because   Samsung is suffering a major setback, chances are good that Apple   will grab an even larger share of profits in the industry.It's hard to objectively calculate how much a brand like Apple   is worth, so investors need to take these estimations with a   grain of salt. However, the main point to consider is that brand   value is a crucial return driver for investors inApple stock.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc.'s Surprisingly Strong Mid-Range iPhone Offering;10/15/2016;"Image source: Apple.WheneverApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) releases new flagship smartphones, the   prior-generation models are usually discounted by $100. This   effectively makes last year's Apple flagship into this year's   mid-range offering, allowing Apple to participate at a wider   range of price points than it would have otherwise been able   to.makeArticleAd();This strategy has worked reasonably well for Apple as its   flagship devices tend to be advanced enough to successfully   inhabit those mid-range price points but not so advanced so as to   diminish the value proposition of the flagship model.Although the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were disappointing   sellers as flagships (Apple saw its first-ever iPhone sales   decline during this product cycle), as this year's mid-range   offerings, they are probably the most competitive products that   Apple has ever had at these price points.iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus still competitive with Android   flagshipsIn prior generations, it'd have been hard to make the case   that Apple's previous generation phones were, in meaningful ways,   superior to flagship devices from major Android-based   competitors. However, this year it's not a hard case to make at   all.The A9 processor inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus   offers better single/dual core CPU performance than what can be   found in any other Android smartphone according to the Geekbench   4 performance test (Android flagships have the A9 beaten on   multicore performance, but per-core performance is generally more   important for the user experience).Both the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus also incorporate   Apple's 3D Touch functionality. Similar technologies have begun   to pop up in a few Android smartphones, but the major flagships   from well-known brands such asSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , LG, and HTC have yet to incorporate a   similar feature (though I suspect they will in due time).Apple also wisely opted to increase the amount of storage that   it offers in these price-reduced iPhone 6S devices. The base   iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models now come with 32 gigabytes of   storage and 128 gigabytes in the higher price tier.Those storage increases, coupled with the price cuts, should   dramatically improve the value propositions of these   former-flagships-turned-mid-range phones.The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus aren't ahead of current   Android flagships in every respect, though. The iPhone 6S and   iPhone 6S Plus are behind in terms of display resolution,   cellular performance, and the cameras.That being said, the fact that Apple's year-old flagships are   as competitive as they are could help the company gain some share   at lower price points against the Android makers.iPhone 7 and 7 Plus should hold up extremely wellI believe that this year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are much   more competitive as flagship devices than the iPhone 6S and   iPhone 6S Plus were when they were Apple's top devices. Assuming   that Apple's competitors don't advance their phones at a quicker   pace than they did in between the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, then I   could actually see the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus holding up even   better against Android flagships post-iPhone 8 launch than the   iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are now.And, for Apple, gaining smartphone share while keeping its   average selling prices healthy (Apple's mid-range phones start at   $549) is critical to allowing its iPhone business to deliver   profitable growth. Increasingly strong mid-range offerings should   allow Apple to do just that.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. Stock Rests On iPhone 7 Demand (AAPL);10/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock has been on a nice tear of late as analysts have harped   onSamsung's(SSNLF) trash (the exploding Note 7) as Apple's treasure.The iPhone maker's sharesfinally had a tough time on Thursday, but they bounced back quickly on Friday as the countdown to the   next earnings report is on. iPhone 7 sales will be a key   component ofApple stockover the next several months.makeArticleAd();Apple Stock Target UppedThe September quarter has just a short time covering iPhone 7   sales. This is pretty typical of September quarters, although   this year's quarter has more sale days for the newest handsets   compared to the year-ago quarter with the iPhone 6s. While there   are always differences in iPhone unit estimates among analysts,   this year there seems to be an exceptionally wide berth where   headlines are concerned.Morgan Stanley(MS) analyst Katy Huberty bumped up her price target for Apple stock   by $1 per share to $124 per share based on better-than-expected   iPhone 7 demand. While she said that their higher iPhone   estimates in the near term are already mostly baked into Apple   stock, she added that she's getting more confident that the   iPhone 7 cycle will drive ""meaningful"" revisions to estimates and   push the shares toward her $162 bull case.Indeed, the headlines here fall into one of two categories:   ""iPhone 7 sales are better than expected"" or ""iPhone 7 sales are weak."" Of course Huberty falls into the former category and has for a   long time.Apple's Estimates Also IncreasedThe analyst increased her estimates for Apple's fourth fiscal   quarter, as she believes the features of this year's new phones   are ""compelling enough"" to result in a ""record number of   switchers and decent number of refreshers"" off Apple's current   installed base of more than 600 million iPhones. She believes   that the dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus and ""to a lesser   extent,"" Samsung's Note 7 recall are shifting the iPhone mix   toward the larger of the two phones, thus boosting the average   selling price and margins.10 Stocks That Every Investor Should OwnHuberty estimates that every 10-point increase in iPhone 7   Plus mix will add $20 to the average selling price, raise the   gross margin 15 basis points and add 1 or 2 cents to Apple's   earnings per share. She believes the company will come in toward   the high end of guidance because iPhone 7 demand appears strong   but supply is limited. As a result, she bumped up her iPhone unit   estimate from 43 million to 44 million and moved her average   selling price estimate from a decline of 7% to a decline of 3%   due to greater demand and better mix.However, she cut her iPad unit estimates. She now pegs Apple's   September quarter at $47.2 billion in revenue, $1.65 per share in   earnings, and a 38% gross margin, which are in line with   consensus. They're also close to the high end of management's   guide for $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion in revenue and 37.5% to   38% gross margin. While she sees this year as shaping up well   already, she called fiscal 2018 the real supercycle.While Apple bears are relatively few compared to the general   bullishness that has surrounded the company for some time, they   do exist. One such example isForbescontributor Bert Dohmen ofDohmen Capital, who said that iPhone 7 sales are so poor that Apple didn't even   release first week sales as it has in the past.However, the company has said that supply is the problem   rather than demand, although this is something we won't know   until we see unit numbers for the September and December quarters   (but mostly December).Dohmen argues that Apple won't end up being themain beneficiary of Samsung's Note 7 debaclebecause he believes that consumers who have had a Galaxy phone   won't return to the ""Apple 'eco-jail.'"" He also noted that a   ""relatively small number of people"" use the Note, which is also a   very large device.The Love Story Is Over for Twitter Inc       (TWTR)As a result, he suggests that Note 7 users may be more likely   to turn to other Android devices such asAlphabet Inc's(GOOGL) new Pixel phones.Apple stock edged upward by as much as 0.28% to $117.31 during   regular trading hours on Friday, and closed ahead 0.56% at   $117.62 per share.The postApple Stock Rests On iPhone 7 Demand, Earnings   Even More Nail-bitingappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. May Have Just Confirmed Apple Inc. A12 Win;10/14/2016;"Image source: TSMC.Back in 2015, it was revealed thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had decided to source the A9 applications   processor that powered the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus from bothTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .makeArticleAd();This was viewed as something of a blow to TSMC, as the company   was previously the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's A8 chip.Since then, TSMC's execution appears to have improved. It is   widely believed to be the sole manufacturer of Apple's A10 Fusion   chip inside of the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.   It is also expected to be the sole manufacturer of next year's   A11 processor, particularly in light of management's comments   that it will have in excess of 70% foundry market share at the   10-nanometer node.Based on commentary from TSMC's third-quarter earnings call,   it looks as though it might have won the entirety of Apple's A12   orders as well.TSMC expecting substantial share at 7     nanometersWhen an analyst asked TSMC's executives about what kind of   share the chipmaker expects to have during the 7-nanometer   technology generation, co-CEO Mark Liu had the following to say,   according to a transcript fromSeeking Alpha [sign-in required]:High. We'd say high. Higher than 10-nanometer. We want to do     every node higher than the previous node.Based on this comment, and assuming that the A12 chip will be   manufactured in a 7-nanometer process rather than a 10-nanometer   one (and I believe this is a safe assumption to make), it stands   to reason that TSMC has won the entirety of the Apple A12   contract.Additionally, since the 7-nanometer node is expected to be   TSMC's leading edge technology until around 2020 (when it rolls   out its 5-nanometer technology), Apple will likely build the A13   on TSMC's 7-nanometer technology as well.And, given that Apple is responsible for a substantial amount   of revenue and unit shipments on a given technology node, it   would be very hard for TSMC to have ""higher than 10-nanometer""   share if it weren't the exclusive manufacturer of the A13.Impacted businessesFor TSMC, this is likely good news for a couple of reasons.   First of all, Apple doesn't tend to reduce the sizes of its chips   much, instead opting to use the additional chip area that new   manufacturing technologies bring to add features/performance.   Given that 7-nanometer wafers will almost certainly be more   expensive than 10-nanometer wafers (which in turn are likely to   be more expensive than 16-nanometer wafers), I expect TSMC's   dollar content from the applications processor within future   iPhones to continue to move upward.Beyond that, though, to the extent that Apple's iPhone unit   shipments grow, so too should TSMC's revenue from Apple.The main loser here isSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which is a competitor to TSMC in contract   chip manufacturing. Apple used to be a major anchor customer for   Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business, but it would   appear that this business is gone in the near-to-medium term --   and potentially for good.Further, if TSMC's share projections are accurate, Samsung   foundry customers likeQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) might be planning to jump ship -- in whole, or in   part -- to TSMC at the 7-nanometer node.Fortunately for Samsung, contract chip manufacturing is a very   small part of its nearly $40 billion chip business (IC Insights   estimated Samsung's contract chip business at less than $3   billion in revenue during 2015), let alone its total business, so   losing out to TSMC isn't really a ""game changer"" for Samsung's   business or its stock price.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Sales: Don't Be Misled;10/14/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a lot riding on its recently released iPhone 7   smartphones. The company's iPhone product category isby far its most important, and after seeing year-over-year shipment and revenue declines   during the iPhone 6S cycle, the company needs the iPhone 7 to do   well.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, there have been several reports claiming that   Apple's iPhone 7 shipments during the second half of 2016 might   actually come in lower than shipments of the iPhone 6S in the   prior year.That might make it seem as though sales of the iPhone 7 are   actuallyworsethan what the iPhone 6S was able to deliver last year. However,   investors need to realize that this isn't necessarily the case at   all. Here's why.Apple over-shipped last time; Apple seems supply constrained   this timeWith the iPhone 6S, Apple likely built and shipped iPhone 6S   devices under the assumption that the then-new device would sell   better in the marketplace than the prior generation iPhone 6.   When it was clear that the end-demand wasn't there, Apple wound   up cutting iPhone 6S production and reducing the number of phones   that it shipped to its channel/distribution partners.That channel inventory reduction led to Apple meaningfully   reducing its own iPhone 6S shipments during the first half of   this year.The initial build plans around the iPhone 7 were likely   informed by Apple's experience with the peak sales of iPhone 6s.   It's not surprising, then, that Apple had originally planned to   build fewer iPhone 7 units during the second half of 2017   relative to what it built of iPhone 6S units in the second half   of 2016.Those initial build plans don't really say much about end   demand.What is telling, though, is that in light of the reduced   builds year over year, Apple doesn't appear to have reached   supply-demand equilibrium; instead, many models -- particularly   the iPhone 7 Plus models in black and jet black finishes -- are   still difficult, if not impossible, to find at Apple retail   stores (and shipping times on Apple's online store are very long   for these models).My bet? iPhone 7 will do better than iPhone 6SAlthough it's too soon to say for sure, I have a suspicion   that the iPhone 7 series of smartphones will do better than the   iPhone 6S did when it was Apple's flagship. Not only are the new   phones more competitive than their predecessors were in terms of   features and component performance, but Apple also has the   benefit of many of those iPhone 6 owners (and given how   successful this phone was, there were likely a lot of them)   potentially being in the market for upgrades.There's also the fact thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , arguably Apple's toughest competitor,   recently canned its Galaxy Note 7 line of smartphones, which   would have competed with Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Some analysts   think that Samsung's stumbles here could lead to unit shipment   upside for Apple, though that remains to be seen.The iPhone 7 seems like it is good enough to allow Apple to do   well over the next year while the company prepares what it widely   expected to be a ""revolutionary"" next-generation iPhone 8.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Samsung Is Desperately Trying to Contain Its Brand Fallout;10/13/2016;"Can you guess which Galaxy device is this? If not, that's a   problem for Samsung. Image source: Samsung.Strong brands can turn out to be a double-edged sword when   things go sideways. That's the lesson thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is grappling with right now, even as the South   Korean conglomerate has its hands full with the logistics of a   global recall for its Galaxy Note 7. Over the years, Samsung has   investedtens of millions of dollarsinto marketing. The world of advertising is similar to the world   of politics: Money matters. A lot.makeArticleAd();A Galaxy phone by any other name would not be as   flammableThe company has built up its Galaxy brand, differentiating its   devices from the rest of the Android camp. Over time, it expanded   the lineup into different sub-brands, each catering to specific   use cases such as the recent Galaxy S7 Active that is intended   for -- you guessed it -- physically active users. There are   literally dozens of other examples.The trouble now is that the Galaxy brand is significantly   tarnished, and many average consumers may not be able to   distinguish among all the different sub-brands, particularly in   the face of all the negative publicity. It doesn't help that many   of these models often share the same numerical generation in the   model name. People keep seeing explosive headlines about a   Samsung phone with ""Galaxy"" and ""7"" in the name. That may concern   customers who own a Galaxy S7 or a Galaxy S7 Edge.Some Galaxies are safeIn an effort to proactively contain the brand fallout, Samsung   has begun sending push notifications to customers that own these   other seemingly related but safe devices. For example, aTechnoBuffalostaff member received the following message: ""Your Galaxy S7 is   not an affected device. The Galaxy S7 is not subject to recall.   You can continue to use your device normally.""It's not clear if Galaxy S7 Edge owners are receiving the same   message. In contrast, Galaxy Note 7 owners are receiving messages   urging them to return and exchange their devices. All Galaxy Note   7 customers should heed these warnings considering the safety   concerns associated with a carrying a device in your pocket that   risks spontaneously combusting.How much is your loyalty worth?Samsung is willing to pay for loyalty, too, as it is now   offering $75 if customers opt to trade in their fiery devices for   a different Samsung model. That's on top of a $25 bill credit   that some carriers are offering for the exchange, which brings   the total rebate to $100. But that $25 is available even if   customers switch to another brand, so Samsung is really trying to   buy loyalty for just $75.Loyalty is a rare commodity within the Android camp, as there   are plenty of other Android phones that are just as good -- if   not better -- than Galaxy devices. The peace of mind of buying a   non-exploding phone should be worth more than $75.Time may not heal all woundsThere's already evidence that the Galaxy brand is suffering.Business Insiderreports that YouGov BrandIndex is already seeing measurable   declines in two important brand metrics. The number of people   that recommend the brand to friends and family has gotten crushed   over the past couple of months, while purchase intent has   simultaneously trended lower among respondents.The real question will be whether or not Samsung can salvage   the Galaxy brand that it has worked so hard to create, which only   time can answer.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc.'s Got a Big Watch Problem;10/13/2016;"Image source: Apple.Just a few months ago,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made a couple of announcements around its Apple   Watch product category. In a nutshell, it released a new Apple   Watch Series 2 device with improved internals, a better screen,   water resistance, and integrated GPS. It also updated the   internals of the original Apple Watch to include the same   processor as the one found in the Apple Watch Series 2 but kept   the design and the display largely similar.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, according to an Augustreportfrom Bloomberg, Apple wants to include cellular connectivity in a   future Apple Watch, but one of the challenges it faces is keeping   battery life in check.Indeed, Bloomberg says that ""current cellular chips consume   too much battery life, reducing the product's effectiveness and   limiting user appeal,"" citing ""people with knowledge of the   matter."" In response, Apple has reportedly ""begun studying   lower-power cellular data chips for future smartwatch   generations.""This all seems very reasonable, but I believe that it   highlights a key weakness within Apple's chip teams that the   iDevice maker will need to remedy at some point down the   line.Integrating a cellular modem would probably helpAs of today, Apple has yet to release a processor with an   integrated cellular modem. In its iPhone and cellular-capable   variants of its iPad products, Apple uses standalone applications   processors paired with standalone cellular modems sourced fromQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .Other companies that develop processors for mobile use have 3G   and 4G cellular modem technology in house and are able to   integrate that technology into the same silicon die as the main   applications processor. This is generally leads to better power   efficiency and, ultimately, battery life.For example,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recently announced a chip targeted at wearable   devices known as the Exynos 7270 that integrates a 4G LTE modem   on the same die as the processor. Qualcomm, too, offers a chip   known as the Snapdragon Wear 2100 that also includes an LTE modem   on the same die as the main processor.I suspect that if Apple had the capability in-house to   integrate a cellular modem into a future smartwatch-oriented   processor, this would be very helpful for tackling those   potential battery life issues.Apple may very well be working on itThere has been plenty of evidence that Apple has continued to   build out teams to work on wireless chips. For example, Apple put   up a job listing on Sept. 21 looking for someone to work ""as part   of a silicon design group responsible for designing   state-of-the-art wireless"" systems on a chip.It's hard to know exactly what this might be for, but it could   very well be in service of an in-house cellular modem effort for   integration into a future Apple Watch processor.Apple will figure it out, one way or anotherAlthough it would appear that Apple is currently at a   competitive disadvantage with respect to the integration of   cellular modems inside its Apple Watch-bound processors, it's   important to note that Apple is extremely technically competent   and spends significantly on research and development in support   of its key product categories.The Apple Watch appears to be something that Apple is planning   to invest in over the long term, and as a result I expect that   one way or another it will be able to figure out how to get   cellular connectivity inside a future Apple Watch. The question   isn't really ""if"" but ""when"" -- and that's something that will   become clear in time.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone Business: 3 Things Investors Need to Know;10/13/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fundamentally redefined the concept of the   smartphone with its 2007 introduction of the original iPhone. In   the years following, the company has led the way in bringing   significant, even game-changing features that have helped   transform the smartphone into arguably the most important -- and   most used -- computing device category in today's world.makeArticleAd();The iPhone, unsurprisingly, is far and away Apple's most   important product category from a business and financial point of   view.Today, I'd like to go over three key facts about Apple's   iPhone business that current and potential investors in the   company should be keenly aware of.Most of Apple's revenue and profits come from iPhoneIn the company's last fiscal year, the iPhone brought in   approximately $155 billion in revenue out of a total of roughly   $234 billion. This means that more than 66% of the company's   revenue that year came from sales of iPhones .Moreover, Apple's dependence on the iPhone has actually   increased over the last couple of years, jumping from 53.4% of   revenue in fiscal year 2013 to a whopping 66.3% of revenue in   fiscal year 2015.Additionally, as the iPhone is widely believed to be a   higher-margin product than the company's iPad or Mac lineup, it   seems likely that the iPhone makes up an even larger portion of   Apple's operating profit, and therefore net income.It's this dependence on the iPhone that leads many investors,   analysts, and investment commentators to focus so much on the   performance of this product category for Apple. If the iPhone is   doing well, Apple's financials and share price should do well. If   iPhone does badly, then the company's financials and share price   should largely follow suit.Apple's iPhone average selling prices eclipse its   competitors'One of the reasons that Apple has seen such financial success   from the iPhone is that it sells a lot of iPhones at average   selling prices (ASPs) that are well above what its competitors   are able to command. In fiscal year 2015, for example, Apple   brought in around $155 billion in revenue from iPhone on unit   shipments of about 231 million, implying an ASP of $665.To put this into perspective, during the second quarter 2016,   Apple's chief rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) reported overall mobile revenue of   approximately $23 billion. Market research firm IDC estimates   that Samsung shipped approximately 77 million smartphones in that   quarter.Even if we assume that all of this mobile revenue came from   smartphones, we're looking at smartphone ASPs of approximately   $298 -- less than half of Apple's. Note that this is an upper   bound, as Samsung's mobile business includes revenue from tablets   and smartwatches in addition to smartphones, including low-end   smartphones.In terms of average revenue and gross profit per smartphone,   Apple is way out in front relative to its competition. This is   viewed as both a strength (Apple currently has pricing power,   allowing it to capture much of the profit in the smartphone   industry), as well as a potential liability (Apple is at risk of   being undercut on pricing, for example).Apple's iPhone business is currently growth-challengedThrough fiscal year 2015, Apple's iPhone business always   managed to deliver some level of revenue and unit growth.   However, Apple is currently expected to report its first-ever   annual decline in iPhone unit shipments and revenue in fiscal   year 2016, following the first quarterly declines that were   recently reported.Clearly, given that Apple's revenue and profit depend so   substantially on iPhone sales, this has been a key tenet of the   bearish thesis around the company's stock. If the iPhone   continues to decline, then Apple's revenue and profits are set to   suffer, particularly as it will be very difficult for Apple's   other businesses -- large in their own right, but in aggregate   still much smaller than iPhone -- to pick up the slack.However, if the iPhone 7 helps return the iPhone category to   growth in the coming fiscal year, then the company could be   looking atcouple of good years of iPhone growth, particularly as Apple is expected to make some dramatic changes   with next year's iPhone that could further fuel demand   growth.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Disaster: Apple Inc. May Not Be the Biggest Winner;10/12/2016;"Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 has been recalled and discontinued.   Image source: Samsung.Shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are on a tremendous run. Over the last three   months, shares of the consumer electronics company are up   approximately 21% versus the S&P 500's gain of 2%. Even with   the recent outperformance, Apple still trades at a   price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5, approximately half the valuation   of the greater S&P 500's P/E ratio of 25.makeArticleAd();In the last month, Apple's returns have been turbocharged due   toSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) struggles. In September, Samsung issued a   voluntary recall for 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to   a ""minor flaw in the battery manufacturing process"" that led to   phones exploding. Samsung's situation took a turn for the worse   when the company recently announced it would cease Galaxy Note 7   production after replacement units proved no safer than the   initial models.Conventional wisdom states any loss for Samsung is Apple's   gain, and that's most-likely true in some aspect. In the end,   however, the biggest beneficiary of Samsung's struggles may be   the company that provides Samsung's ecosystem:Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Ecosystem is important as device and switching costs are   increasingA base analysis of smartphones typically compares on-device   features and specifications. While things like processing clock   speed, camera megapixels, and design are important, in many cases   the differences between premium smartphones are so minuscule   they're unlikely to drive the buying decision on their own.What does drive the buying decision is the ability to quickly   access photos, emails, and purchased content and to understand   the device layout. The simple truth is the ecosystem -- the   seamless experience between hardware, operating system, and   content -- is becoming the true differentiator between   smartphones more so than device specifications. And when it comes   to ecosystem, the operating system is the key differentiator.While both Apple and Android-powered phones have taken steps   to encourage cross-OS switchers, it's increasingly difficult for   an Android user to become an iOS user, and vice versa,   due to the increasing switching costs from cloud storage,   purchased content (music, movies, and TV shows), and other   OS-specific applications. Ecosystems have become so key to the   buying decision that many smartphone users refer to themselves as   ""iOS-only"" or ""Android-only."" Against that backdrop, it's likely   Samsung's stumbles benefits other high-end Android smartphone   vendors.Alphabet's new Google Pixel smartphone. Image Source:     AlphabetSamsung's Note 7 disaster is good news for AlphabetSamsung's stumbles could not have occurred at a better time for   Alphabet. The company's recently announced Google Pixel   smartphone is a major step in Apple's direction. The company   always had control over the operating system, but took a page   from Apple by essentially taking control of the Pixel's hardware   and software design to control the user experience.Why analysts have typically compared Samsung and Alphabet to   Apple, the bigger risk for these Android partners is internal. A   few years agoThe Wall Street Journal[subscription required] reported Alphabet (then Google) was so   scared of Samsung's Android dominance it actively encouraged   other hardware partners to manufacture Android devices. On the   other hand, Samsung is actively involved with its Tizen OS and   even runs the company's smartwatches off of the Android   competitor.More recently, apprehension between the two has ameliorated as   a combination of Samsung market share losses (particularly at the   low end) and Tizen's inability to gain a large following has   resolved earlier concerns. Alphabet's Pixel smartphone appears to   be a strong offering and should win over Samsung smartphone users   that are looking to upgrade to an Android-powered smartphone.   It's likely Apple will benefit from Samsung's struggles, but   Alphabet's smaller-scale smartphone business will most likely get   a larger boost.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc. Stock Is Finally Getting Some Respect;10/12/2016;"Oct. 10 was a banner day forHP(NYSE: HPQ) shareholders as the stock hit a 52-week high of   $15.88 a share before easing by the end of trading. Still, with a   30% jump in value year to date, HP is riding high. What was the   impetus for Monday's stellar run?It appears that some of the analysts who've been on the HP   fence or were bearish due to the ""dying PC market"" have finally   decided that the rampant gloom and doom was overblown. The good   news is that there are multiple reasons for pundits and investors   to like what HP CEO Dion Weisler and team are accomplishing.There is a caveat to the recent good tidings,   however. Wall Street's recent upgrades of HP stock are still   overly conservative, which should be music to the ears of growth   and income investors.makeArticleAd();Image source: HP.Earning respectHP analysts chimed in with either upgrades, raised price   targets, and/or reiterated positive recommendations on Monday,   and it's about time. As HP demonstrated last quarter, and is   expected to do again this quarter, it's hitting on most cylinders   and even an area of concern for some -- total sales -- has been   more than made up for by strength in other areas.Yes, HP's total revenue declined 4% last quarter to $11.9   billion, but it obliterated the bearish analyst expectations of   just $11.44 billion, as did earnings per share of $0.48 compared   to the $0.44 pundits had forecast. But HP's slight revenue hiccup   was easy to overlook when investors dig a bit deeper,   particularly margins, expenses, and non-GAAP (excluding one-time   items) net earnings from operations.Thanks in large part to HP shaving $600 million in expenses   year over year, its net earnings from continuing operations   actually climbed 20% before taxes to $843 million last quarter,   before it took a hit for ""discontinued operations."" Weisler's   strict expense management efforts are also boosting margins   across the board.HP's personal systems division reported margins of 4.4% las   quarter, up from just 2.8% a year-ago and nearly a full   percentage point higher than the previous quarter. Printing, HP's   Achilles' heel -- though its issues are being addressed -- grew   margins to a sky-high 20.4%, well above last year's 17.4%.Still underappreciatedThough HP has earned a nod from industry analysts of late,   their target prices don't reflect quite as much confidence as   Oct. 10's positive stock price movement might indicate. Most of   the targets are around the $16-a-share range, which HP stock is   nearly at already. If printing is the concern, which it very well   could be given its woeful performance last quarter, that   shouldn't dissuade investors because HP has a plan.Last quarter's $4.42 billion in printer sales was a 14% drop   compared to 2015's $5.16 billion. Much of the revenue decline can   be attributed to HP's supply segment. HP fans have likely heard   about its recent $1.05 billion deal to acquireSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printing and copier business, which includes   some assistance for HP's printing supply woes as well.Bringing Samsung's printing business in-house will not only   ramp up sales thanks to its cutting-edge printer-copier lineup   utilizing multifunction printer (MFP) technology, the deal also   includes the Korea-based giant's supply business and a portfolio   of more than 6,500 patents. Weisler's strategy of targeting   specific niche markets, just as with HP's surprisingly strong PC   division, will also play a key role in turning around its   printing results.The new Sprocket pocket-sized printer is the most recent   example of HP's targeted approach. At $130, the Sprocket isn't   likely to make a dramatic impact on sales in and of itself.   However, its smartphone compatibility and targeting of the   world's social media and selfie photogs is right up HP's   strategic alley. And with an expected 2.5 trillion pictures   snapped this year, those inexpensive Sprockets will require a lot   of supplies.PCs are soaring -- HP topped the U.S. sales list last quarter.   HP also boasts a stellar 3.2% dividend yield, is running a   leaner, meaner operation, and printing is being addressed. A   price target of $16, even with an analyst's ""buy"" recommendation?   The grudging respect is nice, but HP warrants more.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL): The Luckiest D*mn Company on Earth;10/11/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot to make light of what has been a somewhat dangerous situation for some consumers, nor to celebrate a corporate-level disaster, butApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) might be the luckiest company of the year so far. You can see it in the glow inApple stockafter the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone fromSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) yet again demonstrated amajordesign flaw.Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashHow lucky is Apple, and by extension, how lucky are owners of Apple stock?makeArticleAd();They're as lucky as the owners of the Galaxy Note 7 devices thatrecently caught fireareunlucky.There's no official tally yet. Not all incidents stemming from a design problem are publicly reported. It is safe to say, however, that there were more incidents than the dozen or so that have been confirmed, and that was more than enough to prompt Samsung to halt sales of the Galaxy Note 7 until it can figure out exactly what's causing the batteries in the device to overheat, and what to do next.Not Just a Battery ProblemIf this all seems vaguely familiar, it may be because the problem actually surfaced in late August. By early September,all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones were being recalled by Samsunga mere month after it had been released, as some of the phones had caught fire while charging.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of     2016At the time, it was believed to be the batteries used rather than the device itself, and although a simple swap-out of the battery would have sufficed, the company offered an outright exchange for a different device if a customer wished it. As it turns out, the problem doesn't appear to be faulty batteries; it's the device itself.This past weekend,several of the Galaxy Note 7 phones with a replaced battery overheated and caught firejust as the previous ones had.With the design of the device clearly flawed, Samsung has opted to discontinue sales of the device, and to stop making the Galaxy Note 7 altogether.Apple, Alphabet Win at Samsung's ExpenseThe overheating issue has been limited to the Galaxy Note 7, considering it was a design/quality problem and not just a battery issue. But it's not a stretch to say Samsung's reputation has been damaged. That will adversely impact sales of other Samsung phones, funneling consumers to alternative phonemakers like the newGoogle Pixel, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)The real winner here, however, are those who've patiently held onto their stake in Apple stock even though sales of the company's flagship smartphone. Apple's iPhone 7 is the only device that effectively contends with the Galaxy Note 7, and Samsung's device was just disqualified from competing.This couldn't have come at a better time for Apple, either. Although the hoopla surrounding the iPhone 7 was as loud as it usually is for the release of other iterations of the iPhone,credible reports of weak iPhone 7 saleshave spooked Apple stock holders. Now Apple's phone won't have to compete with its biggest threat.The upside to Apple isn't exactly clear, but Standard & Poor's analyst Angelo Zino thinks the Samsung debacle could translate into an additional 14 million to 15 million iPhones sold this quarter. The pros had been expecting sales of 60 million units of the device.It's not just a hollow assumption or hopeful logic. A recent poll performed by CNET found that48.5% of the site's readers would opt for the iPhoneif they had to replace their current Galaxy Note 7.Bottom Line for Apple StockI've made a point in the past about thedangers of putting Apple stock on a pedestal. But I've never denied Apple makes the highest-quality products found in the consumer-tech market.Up until now it didn't matter. Samsung's and Google's hardware quality was ""good enough"" to compare it to the functionality of Apple's devices. The Galaxy Note 7's problems weren't rooted in a logic-oriented design decision though. It was a design flaw, and a dangerous one at that. All of a sudden, Apple's obsession with over-engineering things is paying off in spades.10 Hot Stocks That Made Millionaires in 10     YearsThat is not a reason in and of itself to buy AAPL, but it certainly doesn't hurt the bigger bullish case - even if it was mere luck that put Apple back in the positive spotlight.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.The postApple Inc.

Samsung's Nightmare May Not Be Apple's Dream Come True;10/11/2016;"Image source: Samsung.It looks like it's the end of the line forSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) ill-fated Galaxy Note7. The mobile giant is   halting production of the device after a few flame-bursting   handsets resulted in a recall. Samsung is now asking wireless   carriers and retail partners to cease sales and exchanges,   opening the door for rival handset makers.makeArticleAd();Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is being played up as a huge beneficiary here. The   stock is shooting higher, and a couple of Wall Street pros see   the class act of Cupertino scoring millions of incremental iPhone   sales in light of the calamity at Samsung.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White feels that Apple stands to   score at least 8 million more iPhone units this quarter. That   would be more than half of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxy   Note7 handsets that White was expecting Samsung to ship this   year, though Credit Suisse feels that this will cost Samsung to   miss out on 19 million units.S&P analyst Angelo Zino is even more aggressive. He sees   Apple picking up 14 million to 15 million iPhone sales as a   result of the Note7 fiasco. This would translate into Android   relinquishing 1% of the market share to Apple's proprietary iOS,   based on the roughly 1.5 billion smartphones that industry   trackers expect to ship this year.Another bite of the AppleThings obviously bode well for Apple in this scenario, and the   stock has been shooting higher as Samsung stock takes a hit.Apple stockhit a 10-month high today on the news. However, it's also   important to have realistic expectations here. Apple is going to   benefit from the blazing death of the Galaxy Note7, but let's not   get too ahead of ourselves here.Samsung is going to have a hard time getting back on track.   This is just one of the many devices in its wide product line,   but the Samsung and Galaxy brands are going to get tarnished.   That's clearly good for Apple, but it's probably even better for   many other makers of Android devices.Android remains the mobile operating system of choice,   commanding 87.6% of the market during the second quarter   according to industry researcher IDC. It's far easier and cheaper   to replace an Android device with a rival Android smartphone. If   someone deliberately chose Android over iOS in singling out the   Note7, it's a fair bet that those reasons are still in play.We also get to the unfortunate timing of the event. Apple just   rolled out the iPhone 7 last month, but there's an inventory   shortage of the larger iPhone 7 Plus models. That's going to be a   problem. Buyers of the Galaxy Note7 were likely drawn to the   5.7-inch display. This would make the iPhone 7 Plus and its   5.5-inch display a clearer replacement choice than the iPhone 7   with its 4.7-inch display.Unfortunately for Apple and iPhone 7 Plus seekers, new orders   for Apple's largest (and priciest) smartphone won't be filled for   another three to four weeks. If you own a Note7, are you really   going to risk a fire or go without a smartphone for nearly a   month? If you bought the gargantuan-sized Note7, you will   probably move to a bigger Android device before opting for the   relatively puny iPhone 7.Apple is going to make out like a bandit here, but it may not   be as big a winner as bulls and some Wall Street pros expect it   to be. It's great to see Apple stock surging back into market   fancy in recent months, but we've seen what unrealistic   expectations have done to the stock when things don't play out   just right.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Top Apple Suppliers to Buy Right Now;10/11/2016;"As one of the most successful companies in history, if notthemost successful,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has lifted the fortunes of many of its suppliers   over the years.That's why investing in Apple's suppliers has been   a successful strategy. However, given the iPhone maker's tendency   to squeeze its vendors, succeeding in this strategy requires a   detailed analysis of the companies that help create the innards   for the Mac maker's products. Here are a few of the   best-positioned Apple suppliers today.Company NameMarket CapitalizationmakeArticleAd();Broadcom Limited(NASDAQ: AVGO)$69.2 billionTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM)$152.6 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance.This data provides only a superficial snapshot of these Apple   suppliers, so let's investigate the investment thesis driving   each of these names today.Image source: Broadcom.Broadcom: Apple's diversified chip vendorIt's hard to look at the newly combined Broadcom and not love   what you see. Today's company is the result of last year's   megamerger between semiconductor giants Broadcom andAvago. An active pick in at least one of the Fool's premium services,   the new, post-merger Broadcom has emerged stronger and better   positioned to thrive in our increasingly mobile and connected   world.Apple contributes over 10% of Broadcom's sales -- before the   merger, 14% of Broadcom's and 10% of Avago's sales came from   Apple. But Broadcom is by no means reliant on its Apple vendor   business to drive its financial results. Its diversified chipset   lineup includes radio frequency, wireless combo chips, broadband,   and storage and networking chips, each catering to long-term   secular growth markets in tech. That's why analysts expect   Broadcom's sales to increase 91% this year and 22.8% next year.   (The number is especially big this year because of the merger.)   From a longer-term view, the company is expected to grow its EPS   at an average annual rate of 14.5% over the next five years,   making it one of the most appealing Apple suppliers to own for   the near future.Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,   Ltd.Taiwan Semiconductor: the A10's sole chip     supplierIt's been a great time to be a Taiwan Semiconductor   shareholder. The company now serves as Apple's exclusive   fabrication partner for the powerhouse A10 chip in the iPhone 7,   and the chip fabrication house's shares have surged in reaction   to the news.TSMdata byYChartsThe reaction is understandable. As my Foolish colleague Ashraf   Eassanotes, not only does TSM figure to see revenue rise by virtue of   winning a greater percentage of Apple's business, but it should   also enjoy an additional revenue tailwind by virtue of the A10's   larger silicon footprint. What's more, TSM has also reportedly   won the fabrication contract for the A11 chip that will power   next year's reportedly radically redesigned 10th-anniversary   iPhone. These developments should give TSM a continued boost to   sales, though an increased reliance on Apple deserves some   caution as well.However, although Apple wants to keep its chip foundry   business out the hands of rivalSamsung, it's also shown a willingness to reward its South Korean   frenemy with its chip-vendor deals if it believes Samsung can   produce better results than TSM. Case in point: After TSM   produced the majority of A8 chips, Apple reportedly contracted   with it for only an estimated 30% of its A9 chips.Reports say that Apple comprised only 8.2% of TSM's sales as   of last year, so that number figures to increase dramatically as   a result of winning all of Apple's A10 business. Not that TSM can   rest on its laurels, especially with mention ofIntel's interest in further scaling out its own third-party chip   foundry services. An Apple-Intel alliance has already been   mentioned as a distinct possibility in either 2018 or 2019,   though they remain just rumors for now.Apple has a deserved reputation as a tough customer for its   suppliers. Just ask the now-defunct GT Advanced. The billions in   sales Apple can offer a potential vendor have historically come   with their own costs, and anyone looking to invest in the   companies within Apple's massive supply chain need to understand   the risks.

Google Re-enters China Through The Back Door;10/11/2016;"ByPeter Fuhrman:The end is in sight for Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) seven wilderness years in China. With none of the theatrics that accompanied its voluntary withdrawal from the country due to web-search censorship in January 2010, Google is now firmly on a path not only to return to China but also to potentially seize a spot alongside Apple (AAPL) as one of the most profitable tech companies there.This is a likely outcome of Google's announcement last week that it is entering with full force the global consumer hardware industry. Google Pixel mobile phones, Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled speakers, Google Daydream View virtual reality headsets - these will be the engines of Google's revival in China. Based on what Google has so far revealed - including pricing - these products may find a large market among Chinese consumers.The company has made no specific mention of plans to re-enter China. China's government will not likely strew the ground with rose petals to welcome Google back.makeArticleAd();Instead, Google can rely on China's enormous grey market for electronics hardware to bring its products into China's on-and-offline retail network. Hong Kong is usually the main transshipment point, not only because prices are lower than in the PRC, but the quality of hardware sold there is considered to be higher.There is a precedent here. Apple took six years after the iPhone's launch to ramp up its official sales channels in China by doing a deal with the main carrier, China Mobile (CHL). By that point, an estimated 30m to 50m grey market iPhones were already in use in China.Mobile phones running Google's Android system already dominate the Chinese market, with about 300m sold this year. Most are sold unlocked without carrier subsidy. None can freely access Google search, storage or maps. The Google Pixel will likely have similar limitations.But Pixel will have huge advantages no other Android phone can match of closely integrating the operating system and device hardware to optimize the performance of everything else on the phone.All of China's many Android brands will be impacted, but none more so than the current market leader, Huawei. It now dominates the high-end Android market in China, even more so with Samsung's (SSNLF) recent woes. The Pixel will be priced to compete directly with Huawei's flagship models.It is not only in its home market of China that Huawei may get battered. It has also set great store on becoming the world's leading Android phone brand in Europe. That will certainly be far harder to achieve now.As it happens, Google's announcement came at a time when just about everyone at Huawei, along with everyone else in China, was enjoying a week-long national holiday. They return to their desks this week to find the tech world disrupted. No one quite predicted Google would amp up its hardware strategy to this level.Google had toyed around before, selling small volumes of its outsourced Nexus-branded mobile phone to showcase more of Android's features. Huawei was one of the companies making Nexus phones. Google also bought Motorola's mobile phone business in 2011 and unloaded it two and a half years later to China's Lenovo (LNVGF) (LNVGY), a deal that has not worked out at all well for the Chinese company.But this time, Google says it is not dabbling. It defines its future strategy as becoming, like Apple, a fully vertically-integrated hardware and software business, but one with the world's most powerful system of proprietary voice and text-enabled artificial intelligence.Google introduced three hardware products last week. More are certain to follow, including perhaps a mid-priced phone that will take aim squarely at China's Xiaomi (XI) (among others), already reeling from falling sales and an inability to crack the more lucrative higher-end Android market.Google's advantages run so deep they can seem unfair. Not only does it own and develop the Android software its competitors except Apple rely on, it also already has one of the world's best and most recognizable brands. Also worth noting, Google now has about $70bn in cash, mainly sitting outside the US, looking for new markets to conquer.As for the other new Google hardware products - the home speaker and virtual reality ((VR)) headset - the market seems ripe for the taking. Despite billions of government dollars invested into Chinese companies working on machine-learning, artificial intelligence and VR, none has come to market in any significant way.Even if they now do, none can match Google's enormous breadth, capability and experience in human-machine dialogue.Though a success in the US, Amazon's (AMZN) Echo home speaker, which is capable of interacting with the human voice, is a non-entity in China. It does not understand spoken Chinese. Google, on the other hand, is quite adept at Chinese. While Google Maps, Gmail, Drive are all blocked in China, Google Translate is not.Indeed, the Chinese government quietly stopped blocking it about a year ago. It's the only one of Google's major online offerings that can be readily accessed in China. The reason: Google Translate has become an essential tool for Chinese companies active internationally, as well as for many of the 150m middle class Chinese now vacationing abroad each year.If Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, is correct, the world including China is moving from a ""mobile-first to an AI-first world."" Google is already miles farther down this path than any Chinese company. It need not reestablish its search engine business in China to be a major force there.As for China's government, however it chooses to react to Google hardware products sweeping into China, its own aspirations to nurture globally-competitive indigenous tech companies probably just got a lot harder to achieve.In the seven years since Google departed, China became in many areas even more of a tech Galapagos. Poised now to reenter China by the back door, Google should like the way the competitive landscape looks there.If Google takes just 1 percent of the China Android market - and my prediction is it will do markedly better - it will have $2bn of annual revenues in China, a business larger, more valuable and unassailable than when it pulled out.Peter Fuhrman is Chairman & CEO of China First Capital, a   boutique investment bankAs published in the Financial TimesDownload PDF versionSee alsoAmerican Express: Re-Rating Has Begun And Will Drive The Stock To The $90son seekingalpha.com"

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Shouldn’t Fear Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG) Pixel … Samsung Should;10/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfterAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) big event earlier this week, the natural assumption was that Google is gunning forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).Source: Google/SamsungThe new Pixel smartphone is certainly a worthy competitor to the iPhone 7, and by controlling the hardware design and the software, Google is definitely emulating Apple's approach. But it's actuallySamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) that should be worried.makeArticleAd();It's Tough to Get Consumers to Switch PlatformsThe fight for mobile domination has been a long one and a tough one. Android won the battle for top spot long ago, but Apple's iOS is comfortably in second place. And while iPhone sales have been slipping, that's more indicative of a maturing of the market than declining popularity.Despite prominentswitching campaignsand undercutting the iPhone in price, Android manufacturers haven't had much success in knocking Apple's market share down significantly.The new Google Pixel smartphones are going to run into the same challenges. They may win over new buyers who pick between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel as their first smartphone. But the same obstacles remain when it comes to convincing longtime iPhone loyalists to make the switch: they're comfortable with iOS and the iPhone, and they have an investment in iOS apps.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of     2016Despite the new Apple-like approach of controlling every aspect of the Pixel phone - from hardware design to software integration - Google isn't yet a threat to Apple's iPhone empire.Pixel Is Bad News for Samsung and Other Android OEMsWhere the Google Pixel stands to be a serious threat to steal market share is competing against its fellow Android smartphones, especially those from Samsung.Samsung is at the top of the Android smartphone food chain, best known for its premium Galaxy smartphones. They are perennially the best-selling Android flagship devices and practically the only smartphones that make any profit of note - outside of AAPL's devices.The premium design and price of the Google Pixel signal that it is aimed squarely at Samsung's Galaxy S7. Google is taking on Samsung in both hardware design and features, with the goal of being the best Android smartphone on the market.But it's not a level playing field.Key to the Pixel experience is Android Nougat and tight integration with Google Assistant, the supercharged AI-powered successor to Google Now.Google Assistant is a Pixel exclusiveand Google is also offering Pixel buyers unlimited online photo and video storage. Like Samsung, Google is also now selling a new VR headset accessory - theDaydream View- the Pixel can be plugged into.Google has pledged to ensure its Pixel smartphones will receive future Android updates, something that's a serious weak point for the platform. Even though the latest version of Android has been available for nearly two months, it's on less than 1% of devices. The most widely installed version of Android is currently Lollipop, at over 35% of devices. And Lollipop is two years old …Compare that to the AAPL equivalent, iOS 10. Released several weeks after Android Nougat, it wason over 48% of all Apple mobile deviceswithin two weeks.GOOGL vs SSNLFSmartphone shoppers looking at a premium Android smartphone now have a big choice to make.They can stick with Samsung and its Galaxy S7, put up with Samsung's TouchWiz UI, wait for Android Nougat to eventually to be released for their device and hope that the powerful Google Assistant someday makes its way into a general Android release … which they will then have to wait for.Or, they can choose the attractively built Google Pixel, with Android Nougat and no OEM interface cluttering it, tightly integrated Google Assistant, free unlimited photo storage and assurance that Google's smartphones will continue to receive timely Android updates.The price is the same.Not good news for Samsung. And making the situation even worse is the timing. The Google Pixel is launching just as Samsung is being roasted in the media over exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7.Eventually, by adopting the iPhone model of designing the Pixel in-house and developing Android around it for seamless integration between hardware and software, Google could well be a threat to AAPL. However, at the moment and for the foreseeable future, Samsung is the smartphone make that should be very worried about this whole Pixel thing.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Top Stocks to Buy for October10 Biotech Stocks to Put on Your Radar This     QuarterThe 10 Best ETFs on the PlanetThe postApple Inc.

Samsung (SSNLF) Buys Apple Inc. (AAPL) Linked AI Startup, Viv;10/6/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's easy to forget thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't create Siri - the company's personal digital assistant - in house. Instead, the company bought Siri in 2010. But the Siri co-founders left and launched Viv, a powerful, next-generation AI platform. Now, AAPL rivalSamsung Electronics KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has acquired Viv.Source: VivAt the time Apple bought Siri, it was an app that acted as a virtual mobile assistant when installed on an iPhone. While the theory at the time was that AAPL's acquisition was about mobile search, Siri became much more.makeArticleAd();Today, Siri is Apple's entry in the increasingly important role of personal digital assistant. It competes against the likes ofMicrosoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana andAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) latest effort, Google Assistant.However, after Siri was integrated into iOS, becoming a key feature of the iPhone 4s,the company's founders left Apple. Since then, Siri has continued to evolve and to expand (it's now found on the Mac desktop), but that growth has been incremental.Viv and the Importance of AIArtificial intelligence - or AI - is becoming increasingly important to tech companies. Among other things, AI means those personal digital assistants can get a lot smarter.Google's big hardware eventfrom a few days ago showcased this new reality.10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday     Shopping SeasonThe common theme running through its new Pixel smartphones, Google Home connected speaker and even the Google WiFi mesh routers is AI. Artificial intelligence powers Google Assistant, taking it beyond the capabilities of Siri. And AI is always working in the background to make Google's products more effective.The creators of Siri - Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham - left Apple and in 2012 founded Viv, an AI startup. At the time, Kittlaus wrote a post forTechCrunchtitled ""Siri is Only the Beginning"" that hinted at the team's goals.Virtual assistants were going to get a lot smarter than Siri, backed by the power of AI.There were hopes that Apple would buy Viv, bringing the Siri creators back into the fold and incorporating the new AI technology to blast past Cortana and Google Assistant with a next generation Siri.Instead, Samsung has acquired Viv.Why Samsung?The reasoning behind the Viv acquisition makes perfect sense for Samsung. The company has no virtual assistant of its own. Its smartphones and tablets mostly run Android. Google's move into Pixel smartphones that compete against Samsung's Galaxy lineup was a wakeup call. Pixel phones are built around Google Assistant and integrated in a way third party Android manufacturers like Samsung could never pull off. In fact, Google Assistant is aPixel exclusive, at least for now.With Viv, Samsung gets the technology for its own AI-powered virtual assistant. Samsung could also integrate Viv's AI smarts into its other connected products, including smart appliances.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tracks Everyone You Chat     WithWhy would Viv go with Samsung? When asked the question byTechCrunch'sMatthew Panzarino,Viv's Dag Kittlaus cited the desire for his company's AI technology to be everywhere: ""They ship 500 million devices a year. You asked me onstage about what our real goal is, and I said ubiquity.""What Does This Mean for the Future of Siri?Samsung's Viv acquisition has disappointed Apple watchers who were hoping for reconciliation and resulting quantum leap in Siri's capability. Viv going to AAPL was only apossibility, though, far from a given.In the meantime, not all the Siri team left with the creators and Apple has continued to improve its virtual assistant. The company has also begun to ramp up its AI investment,creating a Machine Learning division and snapping up startupsin that space. Siri will get better as this AI technology is rolled in, it's just not the fairy tale ending that integrating Viv offered.Where things could really get interesting is in theGoogle versus Samsung struggle, which has been ongoing for years. Viv taking on Google Assistant is just the latest arena where the two ""frenemies"" are poised to go head-to-head, and Google's new Pixel smartphones have thrown gasoline on that fire.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:What Is This Apple Inc.

Why the iPhone 7 Is the Best Phone Nobody Needs;10/5/2016;"iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE.   Apple's latest iPhone looks a lot like the previous model. Image   source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has set the bar so high with the iPhone that the   company has trouble topping itself.makeArticleAd();In fact, since it added Siri in the iPhone 4s in 2011, you   could argue that the company has not made any truly revolutionary   changes. You could also argue that Apple Pay, which was first   released in 2014 with the iPhone 6, meets that threshold, but   certainly nothing on the 6s or 7 models does.It's not that these are not fabulous phones. Every single   iPhone improves upon the last with a faster processor along with   other improvements. The 7 and 7 Plus models have better cameras,   double the storage space on the entry-level models from the   previous standard, marginally better battery life, and a slightly   improved look.The problem is that for most consumers these changes are like   adding five miles per hour to the top speed of a Ferrari. It   sounds nice, and it counts as being better, but very few people   will ever take advantage of the improvements.iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may be the best phones ever created, but   for the most part, the improvements over the 6s and 6s Plus they   replace won't be noticed by most users. The previous-generation   phones were so good that nothing short of adding revolutionary   new functionality should make upgrading worth it.That's not a problem unique to Apple.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) faces it, too, when it releases new versions   of its Galaxy Phone. Better has become ho-hum and even bad phones   are so good that it has become very hard to impress people.Hands-on with the iPhone 7 PlusAs an avid iPhone user who covers the technology space, I   consider upgrading my phone each year for work. And while I was   happy when my order of the iPhone 7 in the new black color   arrived, actually using it was a bit underwhelming.Physically, aside from the change in color from my previous   phone's space grey, the two units look and feel nearly the same.   The new home button and the simulated click work well -- perhaps   even a little better than the old one. In addition, Force Touch,   which I found completely useless on my previous phone, now works   better, making it now just mostly useless.The improved processor and camera may well be as revolutionary   as Apple says they are, but after a week or so of use (and dozens   of pictures of my cats), it's hard to notice that anything has   changed. Battery life is anecdotally better as on my last iPhone,   a full workday of email, pictures, and playingPokemon Gooften left me sub-20% by 5 p.m. Now, after similar usage, I end   up closer to 40%, but it's also worth noting that my past   experience has shown that batteries tend to perform better when a   phone is new.And while I like the new iPhone because it has double the   storage of the previous model -- 32GB versus 16GB for the iPhone   6s Plus -- I'm actually more annoyed by the lack of a headphone   jack than I expected to be. It's not that the included Lightning   headphones don't work and it was nice of Apple to include a   dongle/adapter so people can use old ones, but there are   unexpected issues.The problem is that I almost never use headphones, but I do   plug into my car stereo using the aux port in my vehicle and the   headset jack on the iPhone. I can still do that via the dongle,   but it's mildly annoying to have to carry the adapter with me or   buy a second one to leave in the car.Apple has itself to beatThe problem for Apple (and to a lesser extent, Samsung) is   that its phones are so great that even an iPhone 5 does more than   most people need. This has not been a huge drag on Apple, but   iPhone replacement cycles are lengthening, according toresearchfrom Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), which   said:In the year ending with the June 2013 quarter, 66% of old     iPhones were either under one year old or from 1-2 years old.     By the March 2016 quarter, 51% of old iPhones were either under     one year old or from 1-2 years old. The oldest retiring iPhones     (those over three years old) increased from 5% of all old     phones in the year ending with the June 2013 quarter to 12% in     the March 2016 quarter.CIRP cites two reasons for the longer replacement cycle. ""The   rate of change in iPhone features has slowed,"" wrote the company.   ""In addition, phone financing plans now encourage iPhone owners   to hold on to their current phone.""There's still a certain cultural cachet to getting the latest   iPhone or even the newest Samsung device, but there's no   performance reason for most people to upgrade every two years,   let alone every year. Incremental performance increases are   simply not that exciting or even noticeable to most users,If Apple wants to go back to the frenzy created by the early   iPhones (or Samsung wants to steal its thunder), it needs real   innovation. People will likely hold onto their iPhones longer if   the next one, be it the 7s or the 8, simply offers more of the   same but a little better.That would be bad news for a company that generates over 60%   of its annual revenue from iPhone sales. With iPhone 7, Apple has   inched the bar forward and that's just not very exciting. If that   keeps happening, consumers will likely start paying less   attention to new releases and having the latest model may become   even less of a status symbol.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc's Plan to Address Printer Woes Taking Shape;10/5/2016;"The good news isHP(NYSE: HP) stock is up 8% since announcing a surprisingly strong   fiscal 2016 third quarter on Aug. 24. The not-so-good news is   that HP shares would have really skyrocketed had it not been for   its lagging printer division.Consumer printing-related sales took it on the chin last   quarter, as did HP's supplies segment. What really hurts is that   before taxes, printing generates the majority of HP's earnings   from continuing operations. Needless to say, CEO Dion Weisler and   team have some work to do, but a few of HP's recent moves could   be just what the doctor ordered.Phase one of the planHP's saving grace last quarter were strong PC sales. Notebook   sales were particularly robust and helped HP narrow the global PC   sales gap with China-basedLenovo(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) from nearly two percentage points in the   second calendar quarter of 2015, to a mere four-tenths of one   percentage point this year.makeArticleAd();The 12% jump in notebook units sold led to the PC unit's 4%   overall improvement, despite a 6% drop in desktop sales.   Notebook's delivered a 12% gain in revenue sequentially, and 8%   year over year, which was the catalyst for its ever-so-slight   increase in total sales to $7.51 billion compared to a year-ago   $7.5 billion.As impressive as HP's personal systems unit performed last   quarter -- operating margins also soared to 4.4%, up from just   2.8% in 2015 -- it was how the division was able to engineer such   strong results that will be the impetus for Weisler and team to   turn around that ""other"" division.HP's focus on notebooks targeting the world's mobile consumer   and its recently released virtual reality (VR) ready PC OMEN   specifically designed for gamers are ideal examples of its master   plan. HP isn't trying to be all PC things to all people: It's   carving out niches within the broader market. And based on   several recent moves, it's clear HP intends to replicate that   plan to jump-start printer sales.Image source:HP.Phase two is under wayThe recent $1.05 billion deal forSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printing division is one example of HP's   strategy. The largest printing-related acquisition in HP's   history was highlighted as notable for a number of reasons, but a   few stand out.One, folding Samsung's ""formidable portfolio"" of printers and   copiers utilizing multifunction printing technologies (MFPs)   gives HP customers what is essentially an all-in-one alternative,   including secure cloud-based functionality. Second, the new MFPs,   as per HP, will come with as few as seven replaceable parts,   which translates to increased efficiency and lower cost of   ownership.Finally, the Samsung deal also includes ""more than 6,500""   printing patents, which will facilitate further innovations,   along with a bevy of printing supplies and accessories. Supplies   were HP's second largest source of revenue last quarter, behind   only notebooks, so its 18% sales nosedive last quarter really   stung.Another example of HP's printing strategy of targeting   specific needs and markets is its recently released Sprocket   photo printer. At about the size of a smartphone, Sprocket won't   replace a home or office printer. Sprocket is for the social   media and smartphone camera-happy consumers who, according to one   estimate, will snap 2.5 trillion pictures this year.At an introductory price of $129 Sprocket sales aren't likely   to pad HP's revenue coffers much. However, the trillions of   pictures taken -- the majority of which will be via smartphone --   will require not only a Sprocket to print and share, but also   ink, paper, and any future accessories. Much the way Telecoms   subsidize smartphone costs to push data plans, Sprocket could   turn out to be a means to Weisler's end: boosting supply   sales.There's also the opportunity 3D printing offers -- a market   estimated to reach $30 billion in five years -- high-end   enterprise printer-copier solutions primarily to drive supply   revenue, and the rapid global adoption of PrintOS for HP's print   service providers included in Weisler's strategy. The plan to   reinvigorate printing is taking shape, and if it takes hold, HP's   nice stock price run of late will be just the beginning.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If NXP Semiconductors NV Is for Sale, Which Company Going to Buy It?;10/5/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Rumor has it thatNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is looking for a buyer. Leaning on nameless   insider sources,Bloombergsaid thatQUALCOMM(NASDAQ: QCOM) is in ""preliminary talks"" with the company, and   that NXP is shopping around for a better offer. NXP shares have   soared more than 25% higher since the Bloomberg report was posted   last Thursday.makeArticleAd();It's a juicy rumor, but does it make any sense? Let's have a   closer look.By the numbersFirst, here is a quick rundown of NXP and its supposed   suitors:CompanyEnterprise ValueNet DebtTrailing RevenueTrailing Free Cash FlowsNXP$33.4 billion$7.6 billion$7.7 billion$0.5 billionQualcomm$93.6 billion($5.3 billion)$22.8 billion$6.5 billionBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO)$79.3 billion$11.8 billion$10.9 billion$2.4 billionIntel(NASDAQ: INTC)$189.2 billion$11.0 billion$56.6 billion$11.6 billionSamsung Electronics(NYSEMKT: SSNLF)$134.3 billion$59.1 billion$187.4 billion$16.2 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance.After combining with fellow embedded chip specialist Freescale   Semiconductor, NXP now ranks among the 10 largest companies in   the industry -- but still remains a relative minnow next to these   even larger titans. This in-between market situation puts NXP in   a tricky position. The company is large enough to move the needle   significantly, even for Intel and Samsung, but too large to be an   easy pickup for any of these peers.It's true that most of these suitors have access to more   capital than you see in the typical presentation of cash   equivalents. For example, Intel and Qualcomm could liquidate   nearly $14 billion of long-term investments in a pinch. But   that's a last resort, and a very unlikely method of funding a   major buyout.As for Samsung, the semiconductor arm of this multi-industry   colossus can't lay claim to the entire cash hoard. The Korean   company derives just 24% of its revenue and 32% of operating   profits from its semiconductor division.The only realistic way to structure NXP's combination with any   of these rivals would include additional debt and a fair amount   of stock-swapping. The company is simply too large for a purely   cash-based deal, and none of the suggested partners would make   this move on a whim.So, which company is most likely the winner?Reading the tea leaves, Qualcomm certainly looks like the most   deeply interested partner here. The company is looking to   diversify beyond the mobile communications sector that has   treated it so well over the last decade but is now running out of   steam. NXP offers a brand new slate of target markets that   includesautomotive computingand digital security tools. Both of these would fit like a hand   in Qualcomm's glove, without stepping on any of the buyer's toes   in overlapping markets.Furthermore, Qualcomm feels the itch from a large and inactive   cash pile, and could put it to good use here. The pristine   balance sheet would instantly turn toxic, but current and future   cash flows should straighten out that problem in a couple of   years. And don't forget that Qualcomm's shares are trading near   their 52-week highs, making the stock an effective tool for   cash-plus-shares takeover deals.And there's even more evidence of a pending Qualcomm bid.   According to Bloomberg, NXP hired Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst   Partners to look around for serious bidders. As it happens,   Qatalyst has a history of making big sales to Qualcomm. This was   the firm thatturned Wi-Fi chip specialist Atheros   Communications into a Qualcomm division, with a generous $3.5 billion price tag.Now, I'm not saying that Qualcomm absolutely must, will, or   even should buy NXP.Fellow Fool Leo Sun already explored that   question. But if there's an acquisition on the horizon, Qualcomm looks to   be the most likely buyer.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Pixel Is the First Step in Alphabet Inc’s Grand New Plan (GOOGL);10/5/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsOn Tuesday, Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)unveiled Pixelat an event in San Francisco. Pixel, the company's completely   in-house designed Android smartphone, arrived with a muted   response if the lack of movement in GOOGL stock (up just 0.30%   Tuesday) serves as indication.Pixel represents the ""perfect example of best of Google smarts   combining to make a great user experience,"" said Rick Osterloh,   head of GOOGL's hardware division.makeArticleAd();The market is taking a wait-and-see attitude before reacting   to Alphabet stock, which has risen just 3% this year,   underperforming the better-than 5% rise in theS&P 500index. But ignoring the long-term growth opportunity in   GOOGL stock could be a mistake.Although Pixel is its first real dive into hardware, the phone   itself is a part of the company's grand plan to enter the   smarthome market - anuntapped areawhereApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have already poured their own foundations with respective   products like the new-generation Apple TV and Echo - Amazon's   speaker-centric personal assistant.How Pixel Is a Part of the Bigger Picture""We're moving from a mobile first to an AI first world,""   Alphabet said at its I/O conference in May. Google Assistant is   the company's response to the current version of Apple's Siri. On   Tuesday, GOOGL used the Pixel unveiling to take a deeper dive   into the home by showing off its own smart speaker - Google Home.   As with Amazon's Echo, Google Home encompasses a conversational   voice assistant, which acts not only as a secretary, but also a   music hub and a smart home controller.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of       2016As with Echo, which responds to ""Alexa,"" Google Home is always   listening and users need to simply say, ""OK, Google"" and then   issue a command. Google Home can manage a shopping list and send   it to your Pixel phone. And not only can it use Google Maps to   provide traffic details about your work or home commute, Google   Home - like Siri - can also provide a tailored morning briefing   with your schedule and whatever news is important to you.The success of Amazon's Echo likely inspired Alphabet's deep   dive into the home. Reports suggest that Apple is working on its   own response in the near future. And for GOOGL, Pixel was the   perfect catalyst. Before Pixel, Alphabet relied on original   equipment manufacturers to design and sell Android phones. With   its largest OEMSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) forced to recall various versions of its Galaxy Note 7 due   to battery problems, GOOGL can no longer afford to tie itself to   poor user experiences it can't control.Bottom Line for GOOGL StockAnd while the arrival of Pixel signals Alphabet's intent to   focus on hardware, the home automation market remains its largest   growth opportunity. The fact that Pixel integrates with Google   Assistant is perhaps the most important. You'll be able to buy   Google Home for $130 starting Nov. 4. But you can buy GOOGL stock   starting today at what appears to be a discounted price.Alphabet closed Tuesday at $802.79. GOOGL shares   have a consensus buy rating and an average analyst 12-month price   target of $940, suggesting 17% premium from current levels.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Sell Now or Short Into the       Ground6 Bank Stocks That Can Come BackThe postPixel Is the First Step in Alphabet Inc's Grand   New Plan (GOOGL)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc’s Pixel Is Going Straight for Apple’s Dome (GOOGL);10/4/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) just wrapped up its Oct. 4 event,unveiling a slew of new hardware. But GOOGL stock holders are likely to be focusing most on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones.Source: GoogleGoogle is leveraging its machine-learning smarts to take the battle directly to its primary competitors in multiple areas, all at once.makeArticleAd();Here, we take a look at the products Alphabet just unleashed, including its Pixel smartphones, Daydream VR and Google Home.Pixel Smartphones Go Upscale and UpmarketAlphabet is taking charge of the fight for flagship smartphone leadership with new Pixel smartphones, both branded with the ""G.""The two smartphones are aimed atApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) dual iPhone 7 lineup andSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. Google is no longer competing on the discounted Nexus concept, and has priced the Pixel smartphones as premium devices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Launch 3 New iPad Pro     Models in 2017Both new Pixel smartphones feature the following:Qualcomm, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:QCOM) latest Snapdragon 821 processorIntegrated Google AssistantAMOLED displays12MP camera32GB base storageUSB-CA fast-charging batteryAndroid NougatRounded metal design that bears more than a passing   similarity to the iPhone 7.The smaller Pixel is Full HD resolution while the 5.5-inch Pixel XL gets an upgrade to Quad-HD.Google is claiming test show the Pixel's is the best smartphone camera, ever -no camera bump needed. It's also including unlimited free Google Photos cloud storage. (Take that, Apple!)By choosing the Pixel name, GOOGL is hoping you won't think of these new flagship smartphones as re-badged Nexus devices, helping to avoid awkward pricing questions. The name also aligns with previous Google-branded premium hardware like the Chromebook Pixel.Daydream VRVirtual reality is a big deal, and Alphabet's involvement up to now has largely been limited to one-off projects like its Cardboard VR headsets. ButFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) Oculus is in a lead role as the technology starts to take off, and Google is launching a more serious challenge.Daydream is Alphabet's new virtual reality platform. GOOGL has already signed up over 50 partners for games, educational and entertainment content.The Daydream View is Alphabet's new VR headset. Like Samsung's Gear VR, it uses a smartphone for processing and display. But it's made to be more comfortable, with cloth construction instead of plastic. A standalone hand controller is part of the setup.The Pixel smartphones are the first Daydream-ready phones, by the way.Google HomeWhile the Pixel smartphones are designed to take on Apple and Samsung, Google Home -first announced at Google I/O 2016- is going to be doing battle with theAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo.The Echo has been surprisingly successful in its stealth role as a smart home hub. Despite its acquisition ofNest Labs, Google hasn't been able to gain the same sort of foothold or third party support that Amazon has.Google Home is designed to kneecap the Amazon Echo by offering the same basic premise -an attractively designed streaming music speaker, with always-on microphones, connectivity to Google Assistant for queries and the ability to interact with other smart home products (including its Nest gear). It also incorporates Chromecast functionality, so it can be used to stream video to a TV. The basic hardware can be customized, with three colored fabric bases and three metal options.Alphabet will kick-start Google Home adoption by undercutting the Echo's price by $50.Google WiFiGoogle already released its first crack at home routers, the OnHub line, in partnership withTP-LinkandAsus.Google WiFi is a new line of inexpensive mesh routers that work together to automatically optimize Wi-Fi coverage through your home. Do you have a big house? No more fiddling with extenders, then. Just throw another Google WiFi at it and let the mesh do its magic.4K Google Chromecast UltraAnother piece of hardware unveiled today is a significant upgrade to Chromecast, the cheap dongle that took over the living room.Well … it didn't quite take over, but Chromecasthassold very well. As in 30 million plus sold to date. And now that Chromecast is getting a 4K upgrade option (Google Play movies will also go 4K), it can take on the competition from Amazon andRoku.It can also leave Apple TV fans wondering why Apple's much more expensive streamers are still stuck at 1080p.Pricing and AvailabilityThe smaller Google Pixel is priced at $649, while you'll have to shell out $749 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both smartphones go on pre-order starting today.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of     2016Google Home can be pre-ordered today for $129 (with 6-months of free YouTube RED).

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Plans to Launch 3 New iPad Pro Models in 2017;10/4/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to be going all in on the ""Pro"" strategy to boost slumping iPad revenue, if not actual sales numbers. A report from Japan'sMac Otakarahas a trio of new iPad Pro models being released in spring, 2017.Source: AppleThe move may not actually sell any more iPads than Apple does now, but even if it doesn't, AAPL stands to boost its iPad revenue thanks to the premium pricing on the iPad Pro.makeArticleAd();iPad Sales SlideRevenue from iPad sales still represents a considerable chunk of AAPL's bottom line. In the last quarter, it was $4.88 billion on sales of 9.95 million units. That's just over 10% of the company's total revenue for Q3 2016.However, that number has been sliding for three years. In Q3 2013, iPad sales numbered 14.6 billion. This isn't an Apple-specific issue.Tablet sales worldwide declined 12.3% in Q2 2016, and AAPL actually did better than many competitors.10 Biotech Stocks to Put on Your Radar This     QuarterHowever, iPad sales are a more important revenue generator for Apple, than they are for, say,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), who doesn't even bother to release numbers for its Kindle Fire tablets.iPad Pro to the Rescue?In the latest quarter, the average new iPad sale for Apple was roughly $490. But in Q3 2013, when the sales numbers were much higher, the average price per unit works out to about $436.That difference in average selling price can be attributed to the iPad Pro.Since Apple first released the iPad in 2010, the base price of the latest new iPad had been $499. The exception was the release of the iPad Mini in 2012 for $329. But in 2015, AAPL shook things up with a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro at $799.The bigger move (no pun intended) was 2016's 9.7-inch iPad Pro at $599. This time, Apple decided to sit out updating the aging iPad Air 2, so rather than a new iPad at $499 this year, the latest new iPad was $599.AAPL to Go All-In on iPad Pro in 2017Apple has been expected to ditch the iPad Mini sooner rather than later. It was introduced to fight off cheap, 7-inch Android tablets introduced by Amazon,Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and others. With the popularity of the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus - seen as cannibalizing its sales - the iPad Mini's days seemed numbered.However,Mac Otakara(a blog which was first to predict the iPhone 7 would ditch the headphone jack, gain a new Home button and be offered in two black color options) is predictingAAPL will release three new iPad Pro modelsnext spring.According toMac Otakara, the 12.7-inch iPad Pro will be back, as expected. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro will grow slightly to 10.1-inches. And, the iPad Mini will become a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro, complete with Smart Connector, 4-speaker audio and True Tone display.Increasing the size of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 10.1-inches is a relatively small tweak, but makes it more friendly to business users and is a symbolic break from the past. The original iPad was 9.7-inches, a size Apple always maintained was optimal. But AAPL is now chasing professional that want a larger display for text and numbers, not consumers…And by not jettisoning the iPad Mini altogether, but instead making it an ultraportable iPad Pro, AAPL can consolidate all its new iPads under the ""Pro"" umbrella. Ultimately, that simplifies the product line-up.Is Twitter Inc a Poison Chalice? (TWTR)It also leaves one tablet that's current and affordable for consumers, in the 7.9-inch iPad Pro. And, it jacks up the average selling price for an iPad - despite consumer resistance to pay more - boosting revenue.If Apple could actually sellmoreiPads instead of less, combined with that increased selling price per unit, the tablet business could continue to be one of AAPL's revenue pillars. And while that scenario seems unlikely based on the past three years, at least some people thinkiPad sales are near to reaching bottomand due for a rebound.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace6 Bank Stocks That Can Come BackThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of     2016The postApple Inc.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.'s Deal With Samsung Is a Win-Win;10/4/2016;"Much of the news coming out of theHP Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) camp of late has revolved around CEO Ginni Rometty's   bold spinoff and merger agreements, and rightfully so. Combined,   the agreements to spin off and then merge its struggling   enterprise services unit withComputer Sciences Corp.(NYSE: CSC) and do the same with much of its software division   with U.K.-basedMicro Focus(NASDAQOTH: MCFUF)  have a total value estimated at $17.3   billion.In addition to unlocking value from the soon-to-be-former   divisions, a critical component of Whitman's spinoff plan is to   take ""another important step in achieving the vision of creating   a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company."" The   spinoffs will leave HP Enterprise better aligned with its core   competencies of providing secure, hybrid IT solutions including   software-driven infrastructures for the world's data centers,   delivered via the cloud.Included in a leaner, meaner HP Enterprise is targeting the   world's telecoms, many of which are still utilizing outdated   infrastructures and networks not based in the cloud. Now, with   the assistance of longtime partnerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , HP Enterprise is tackling this skyrocketing   market with an industry-specific suite of solutions.makeArticleAd();Image source:HP Enterprise.Welcome aboardIn December of last year, HP Enterprise introduced its OpenNFV   Solution Portal, which is comprised of an open network functions   virtualization (NFV) platform to provide the world's   communication service providers (CSPs) with what amounts to a   one-stop shopping alternative. At the time, HP Enterprise already   boasted ""more than 60 Open NFV [network functions virtualization]   partners.""The goal is to offer CSP customers an easier, more cost   effective means of ""accelerating their (CSCs) journey to the   telco cloud"" by implementing NFV and virtual network functions   (VNFs). VNFs are essentially integrated apps on an NFV   foundation. The OpenNFV gives developers access to the platform   to add new innovations, which are then tested and verified by HP   Enterprise. After a CSC opts for one of the many NFV   alternatives, HP Enterprise facilitates the implementation.Now the 60-plus existing OpenNFV partners can count South   Korean-based tech giant Samsung among HP Enterprise's bevy of   solution providers. Samsung brings a lot to the OpenNFV table,   including an existing carrier network, a ""commercially proven NFV   solution"" introduced in 2015, and its long history of expertise   in the telecom industry.The two sides have agreed that Samsung will ""take the lead"" in   offering VNFs to mobile networks -- something it knows a little   something about as the world's leading smartphone manufacturer --   while HP Enterprise will manage the NFV transition. Finally, the   partners plan to work on a joint marketing strategy to deliver   ""ready-to-install"" third-party alternatives for CSCs.What's the big deal?The effort that HP Enterprise and now its partners including   Samsung are focusing on the telecom NFV market may seem a bit   overblown given it generated a meager $2.7 billion in revenue   last year. However, according to one NFV industry report, the   telecom industry is nearing widespread adoption of solutions like   HP Enterprise's and those of its partners.The shift in the telecom industry from a hardware to a   software focus is driving the expected change to NFV platforms,   which will result in a whopping 42% compound annual growth rate   (CAGR) between now and 2020. By then, the market will have   mushroomed to an estimated $15.5 billion in sales.With Samsung joining the NFV team, particularly the joint   marketing and sales efforts that are planned, HP Enterprise is   poised to jump-start its Enterprise Group sales. After adjusting   for divestitures and currency, HP Enterprise's key unit reported   flat revenue year over year last quarter.Considering its plans to spin off and merge Enterprise   Services with CSC and the ""non-core assets"" of its Software unit   to Micro Focus, the growth of its Enterprise Group isn't a   nicety. Rather, it's a necessity. Thankfully for shareholders, HP   Enterprise's latest deal -- particularly thanks to its   industry-specific approach -- is another step in the right   direction.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Will Poor Battery Life Hurt Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 Sales?;10/3/2016;"It's only natural for the most anticipated phone of all time to be scrutinized through a fine lens.  Apple'sAAPLiPhone is the most popular phone on the market, and iterations of the product have been closely critiqued and examined after each release.The iPhone 7 has some neat new features like water resistance and stereo sound, but it is no stranger to scrutiny.  Many have been complaining about the latest iPhonelacking a headphone jack and physical home button, but there now seems to be something else folks can complain about.Two tests conducted byWhich?have revealed that the iPhone 7's battery life doesn't last as long as its 3 major competitors' smart phones, which include the SamsungSSNLFGalaxy S7, the HTC 10, and the LG G5.  One of the tests measured how long the phones would last making calls, and the other measured battery life when browsing the web.  The iPhone 7 was the poorest performer in both of these tests.Does this stand to hurt Apple's iPhone 7 sales?The results need to be assessed before judging whether or not these findings can negatively impact the iPhone's revenue potential.  The HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 lasted about 31, 26.3, and 24.9 hours respectively.  The iPhone 7 performed much worse, logging in just 11.9 hours of call time on a full charge.  While its peers have greater longevity in this test, the iPhone 7 will still give more than enough battery life to most users who make lots of calls on a daily basis.  This test's results shouldn't be a deal breaker for most consumers who are thinking of buying an iPhone 7.  It also shouldn't be a deal breaker for those who are considering offloading AAPL shares.The next test showed is probably more important since it measured how long phones lasted while browsing the net.  The HTC 10, Galaxy S7, and LG G5 lasted 13.2, 11.3, and 10.7 hours respectively.  The iPhone 7 came in last place again, but it did so by a smaller margin.  The phone's battery provided web browsing for about 10.2 hours.  The phones that logged second and third place didn't beat the iPhone 7's battery life by much more than an hour, so it seems like Apple's flagship phone is still competent compared to its rival phones' battery lives when using the internet.Bottom LineBTIG Researchbelieves that the iPhone 7's sales will see higher than expected demand because of extended shipping dates which are longer than when the iPhone 6 was released.  The demand is high, and store checks across the globe have leadCitigroup to revisethe number of iPhone 7s it expects Apple to sell in its first fiscal quarter.  The results of the battery life test are probably not what Apple would like to see, but battery life from the phone is still good enough for most users who are mulling over a potential purchase of the iPhone 7.The Zacks Rank is a truly marvelous trading tool.

PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Is on the Rise — Pay Smartly to Cash In;9/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsGrowth initiatives and a strategic price chart suggest   investors are about to get paid in online payments processorPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL). For bulls, though, a long call spread in PayPal stock may   be a less costly way to process that order. Let me   explain.There's no doubt PayPal is in a competitive market niche. Tech   heavyweightsAppleInc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andSamsungElectronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) are all vying for market share in the secular, up-and-coming,   digital wallet space.makeArticleAd();A PayPal stock investor need only consider Apple Pay   to realize the threat. With a massive customer base and   fingerprint technology, it's not a stretch to think Apple could   be asubstantial disruptor.Nonetheless, don't make the mistake of counting PayPal out as   an investment just yet.The 10 Best Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy       for Q4The fact is PayPal is the long-standing leader in   the technology-based payments space. What's more,recent strategic partnershipswithVisa Inc(NYSE:V) andMasterCard(NYSE:MA), plenty of cash (plus growth) already in hand and now, a   supportive chart add up to getting paid in PYPL as a bull.PayPal Stock Daily ChartIn late June, the PayPal stock chart was telling us something   wasbearishly awry.Shares of PYPL had broken key support, with a bearish descending   triangle and small flag pattern hinting of lower prices to   come.That's no longer the case.Bears did manage to eke out several percentage points in   PayPal stock, but ultimately the downside price action proved   short-lived. Since hitting a summer and post-Brexit low of $34,   shares of PYPL have muscled their way higher in a volatile but   bullish base.I'd personally define PayPal stock's last six or so months as   either an irregular cup-shaped or inverse head-and-shoulders   formation. Our view is the technical interpretation is more or   less semantics.More important, both patterns confirm decent upside.   Conservatively and despite modest pressure Wednesday, a price   target of $45 to $47 in PYPL over the next couple months appears   reasonable.PayPal Stock Long Bull Call SpreadIn reviewing the PayPal stock options board, the Jan $41/$45   bull vertical spread is attractive.A Breakout Looms for Stratasys, Ltd.       (SSYS)Priced for $1.59 as shares of PYPL trade near $41, the trader   is in position to gain $2.41, or nearly 160%, if PayPal stock   rallies about 9% through January expiration. That's a nice blend   of risk to reward and gives ample time for the required move to   occur.Also of benefit, the bull call spread shaves over 35% off   the cost of a standalone January $41 long call. That's courtesy   of the $45 strike call positioned at the low end of our price   target range for PayPal stock - and bottom-line, it's a spread   payment worth the purchase price.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

BlackBerry Stock Pops on Surprising Fiscal Q2 Earnings Report;9/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market could have easily interpreted the glass as being half-empty for struggling smartphone makerBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY). But investors chose to see the glass as half-full, sending BlackBerry stock up as much as 6% inpremarket tradingon Wednesday following a surprise earnings beat.Source:WEi WEi via FlickrLast quarter - the company's second fiscal quarter of 2017 - the Canadian smartphone and mobile software makerlost 71 cents per share of BlackBerry stock, though when stripping out one-time costs the company broke even. The top line rolled in at $352 million. A year earlier, the company lost 13 cents per share on sales of $490 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents per share of BBRY stock this time around, on $394 million in revenue.makeArticleAd();CEO John Chen commented, ""We are reaching an inflection point with our strategy. Our financial foundation is strong, and our pivot to software is taking hold.""To that end, BlackBerry's software and service revenue grew 111% on a year-over-year basis, reaching approximately $155 million, or 44% of the company's total revenue.But that growth is coming at the expense of other segments.The 10 Best Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy     for Q4Service access fees accounted for 26% of last quarter's revenue, or $91 million, while mobility solutions (devices) made up 30% of fiscal Q2's sales. That's approximately $106 million worth of business for its waning hardware division. BBRYsold $201 million worth of smartphones in fiscal Q2 2016. Service access fees dropped more than half, from $211 million in the same quarter a year earlier.BlackBerry Quits the Hardware Business … KindaIn response to weakness in its hardware unit, Chen has finally decided to move forward with a long-discussed plan to get out of the hardware business … at least directly. BlackBerry will completely outsource this function to partners, meaning BlackBerry-branded devices will remain on the market. Chen added, ""This allows us to reduce capital requirements and enhance return on invested capital.""The once-iconic phone maker known as Research In Motion Limited established the smartphone business by unveiling the device that would eventually become its moniker (the BlackBerry) in 1999. They were wildly successful within the business community. But once theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone was introduced in 2007 and Android devices began to be unveiled shortly after that, not only did BlackBerry continue to struggle in the consumer market, it started to lose ground within the enterprise market.BlackBerry stock has reflected the demise of the company's market share, with BBRY shares losing95% of their valuesince peaking in mid-2008.What's Left?In an effort to capitalize on its remaining strengths, last year, Chen has refocused the company on enterprise mobility and security, acquiring organizations that would give it new tools to that end. Most recently, it hasteamed up withZimperiumto sell a mobile security app, though the app isn't available on devices that run BlackBerry's operating system. It will only function on Android and iOS devices, underscoring the notion that its own hardware is taking a backseat to its other software and service ventures.While BlackBerry may be scaling back its phone business (though perhaps it would be more accurate to say a lack of demand is forcing a scale-back), it's exploring other uses for its IP portfolio.The company recently announced it had sold its first devices that help companies keep tabs on fleet vehicles. Just called BlackBerry Radar, thetechnology not only tracks a vehicle's locationbut can also monitor things like a trailer's temperature and whether or not its door is open.BlackBerry andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) also recently debuted asuper-secure tabletthat's aimed at government agencies and enterprise customers.Looking Ahead for BlackBerry StockAs for the future, Chen said:""We remain on track to deliver 30 percent revenue growth in software and services for the full fiscal year. We are revising upward our non-GAAP EPS outlook to a range of breakeven to a five cent loss [per share of BlackBerry stock], compared to the current consensus of a 15 cent loss. This reflects increased confidence based on improving margins and reduced interest expense from the recent refinancing of our debt, as well as planned investments in growth areas.""Analysts are expecting sales of $1.51 billion for the current year, down 6% from last year's top line.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBank of America (BAC) Stock Gets Some Help You     Can TrustThe 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of Q3 20167 Debt-Free Stocks That Will Survive the Coming     Bear MarketThe postBlackBerry Stock Pops on Surprising Fiscal Q2 Earnings Reportappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Better Buy: Sierra Wireless vs. InvenSense;9/28/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.BothInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) andSierra Wireless(NASDAQ: SWIR) have taken a beating over the past year, with   their stock prices down 20% and 33%, respectively. But both   companies still have lots of potential in their respective   markets.makeArticleAd();Let's look at the problems facing both companies and what   they're doing to fix them, and decide which company might be the   better buy for investors.SWIR,INVNdata byYCharts.The case for Sierra WirelessSierra Wireless' stock hasn't exactly been an easy one to   watch. In the second quarter of this year the company beat Wall   Street's estimates, but posted a quarterly decline of 1.1%.   That's not all that great, of course, and revenue for the   company's OEM solutions unit (its main revenue driver) fell by 4%   year over year.Part of the decline from OEM was from investments in new   customers that should pay off down the road. Management said on   the second-quarter earnings call that two new design wins in the   China OEM market, along with new wins in transportation, smart   metering, networking and industrial segments, will help long-term   growth. But the company also added that OEM revenue may still be   weak in the short term.Additionally, Sierra Wireless increased revenue from its   second-biggest business segment, Enterprise Solutions, by 10%   year over year. Part of this growth came from sales of two new   products, the RV50 industrial gateway router and the MP70 rugged   mobile router. The company also said new products are launching   in the second half of this year that should continue to grow   enterprise revenue.Another bright spot for Sierra Wireless comes from its recent   purchase of GenX Mobile. The company believes the purchase will   not only help it scale some of its enterprise products, but could   also lead to more sales in the company's cloud and connectivity   segment by bundling GenX Mobile devices with cloud services.And despite its overall revenue losses, Sierra Wireless   continues to hold onto its dominant position in revenue market   share (currently 33%) of the embedded machine-to-machine (M2M)   module business.The case for InvenSenseInvenSense's story is one full of possibilities, but also not   without its pitfalls. The company is best known for making motion   sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers) for the mobile market,   and boasts bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsungas customers.That was all well and good when both smartphone makers were   seeing sky-high device sales, but the overall smartphone market   has cooled as of late.Smartphone shipments were flat in the first quarter of this   year, rising just 0.2% year over year compared to growth of 16.7%   in the first quarter of 2015. According to IDC, first-quarter   2016 growth was the smallest year-over-year smartphone growth on   record, and it's not expected to get much better. IDC expects   growth todropto just 0.2% between 2015 and 2020 in developed smartphone   markets.InvenSense receives 46% of its total revenue from Apple, and   with iPhone sales seeing consecutive year-over-year declines   (16.3% in Q2 2016 and 15% in Q3) that dependence has hurt   InvenSense. In fiscal Q1 2017, InvenSense's revenue came in at   $60.6 million, representing a 43% drop year over year.The company knows better than anyone that it can't continue to   rely on Apple for such a large chunk of its revenue. That's why   InvenSense is diversifying some of its revenue away from its   mobile segment. A year ago, InvenSense brought in 72% of total   revenue from component sales from its mobile segment, but that's   since fallen to 63%. Meanwhile, its ""Internet of Things and   other"" segment has grown from 12% to 25% of total revenue.Selling components to other markets outside of mobile will be   the key to the company's future stability. Smartphone sales could   bounce back, of course, and if Apple pulls off blockbuster sales   of its new iPhones, then InvenSense should definitely benefit.   But diversifying its customer portfolio is certainly on the top   of InvenSense's to-do list.The verdictI think Sierra Wireless' dominant M2M embedded module position   and its growth from its enterprise and cloud services segments --   along with new customer growth in its OEM business -- are putting   that company in a very strong position.Between Sierra and InvenSense, Sierra's business appears to be   much more stable. Its revenues are growing faster than   InvenSense's, and the company has no customers that account for   as large a percentage of revenue as Apple does at InvenSense. For   now, Sierra gets my pick.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Intel Corporation Likely to Maintain Process Density Leadership at 10 Nanometers;9/27/2016;"Microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has long been known for its chip-manufacturing   prowess relative to competitors. Its manufacturing technologies   have often offered better performance than the competition, and   it has usually been able to bring denser technologies -- that is,   technologies that allow chip designers to pack more functionality   into a given area -- to the market sooner than its   competitors.However, in recent years, Intel's chip manufacturing peersTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been working to try to narrow the   gap.During the next couple of years, Intel is certainly going to   face something of a public relations/perception nightmare as its   chip-manufacturing peers transition to technologies that they   refer to as ""7-nanometer"" -- usually smaller is better -- around   the time when Intel will be in production on a technology that it   calls ""10-nanometer."" Although there's more to a   chip-manufacturing technology than density, it's a relevant   metric that has a direct impact on the capabilities that these   companies can, cost-effectively, put into their chip designs.makeArticleAd();A question that's worth pondering, then, is the following:   Will Intel be able to maintain chip-area leadership with its   10-nanometer technology even as competitors transition to their   ""7-nanometer"" technologies? I think the answer to that is   ""yes."" Here's why.Comparing TSMC's public statements with     Intel'sI consider TSMC to be Intel's fiercest and most capable   competitor. It's the world's most successful contract chip   manufacturer, and over the last several generations, it has   executed brilliantly in ramping new manufacturing technologies   into production in support ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) A-series processors.In contrast, Samsung has lost Apple's business, and is even   reportedly activelyshifting focus awayfrom contract chip manufacturing in favor of display   manufacturing. In light of this, I think the most   interesting discussion is one in which we look at Intel's and   TSMC's public statements head-to-head.A metric that Intel uses (publicly) to compare the relative   densities of two manufacturing technologies is gate pitch   multiplied by cell height. (A visual representation can be found   below.)Image source: Intel.Intel says that, using this metric, its 10-nanometer   technology offers ""close to a full generation lead in logic   density,"" as illustrated in the slide below:Image source: Intel.Intel also claims that its 10-nanometer technology provides   better than its historic 0.46 times scaling factor relative to   its 14-nanometer technology, though the chipmaker doesn't specify   by how much.In the table below, I show the gate pitch multiplied by   minimum metal pitch -- a similar metric that Intel and others   have used in the past in place of gate pitch multiplied by cell   height -- for several Intel and TSMC technologies, as well as my   projections. This is based on Intel's and TSMC's public   statements for what future technologies will bring:IntelTSMC14nm/16nm3640576010nm<1674~28807nmN/A~1766Data sources: Intel and TSMC.At the 14/16-nanometer generation, Intel had a clear lead over   TSMC in terms of density. TSMC says (viaEETimes) that it will go into mass production on its 10-nanometer   technology by the end of the year, and that it will provide a 50%   area reduction compared to its 16-nanometer technology. TSMC's   10-nanometer technology should be superior to Intel's   14-nanometer technology in terms of chip area, and it should be   in mass production before Intel's 10-nanometer technology.At 10 nanometers, Intel should see a scaling factor of   something smaller than 0.46 times, per its own statements,   resulting in the <1674 figure given in the table above.   According to EETimes, TSMC claims that its 7-nanometer technology   will offer a 1.63 times the density of its 10-nanometer   technology -- an implied scaling factor of ~0.613 times.Intel should have a slight area leadBased on the analysis above, Intel's 10-nanometer technology   should have aslightarea lead over TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. What this   means is that Intel's marketing claims that it's almost a   generation ahead of TSMC are virtually worthless because TSMC's   10-nanometer technology should be in mass production before   Intel's.In fact, in terms of timeline, TSMC's 7-nanometer technology   is expected to go into mass production in the first quarter of   2018 -- approximately two quarters after Intel begins mass   production of its 10-nanometer technology. (Intel's first   10-nanometer chips should go on sale in the fourth quarter of   2017 according to leaks, implying mass production starting in the   third quarter of 2017).The reality is that, in terms of chip area scaling, Intel is   likely to have a roughly six-month lead over TSMC. This, in the   scheme of how long these technologies are expected to remain   leading edge, is just not all that long.The good news for Intel is that, contrary to the marketing   labels that TSMC (and other contract chip manufacturers) assign   to their technologies, it won't actuallyfall behindits competition in terms of chip area scaling. The days of Intel   having a substantial leadership position in this metric, though,   are likely long gone.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Survey Shows Consumers Are Happier With Their Personal Computers;9/27/2016;"Desktop computers still rate surprisingly well. Image source:   Apple.Personal computers have stopped a three-year slide in customer   satisfaction by climbing 1.3% to a 78 on the latestAmerican   Customer Satisfaction Index(ACSI) Household Appliance and Electronics Report.makeArticleAd();Desktop computers continue to rank the highest on the ACSI   survey, which uses a 100-point scale, remaining unchanged from   last year at 81, while tablets and laptops have improved for the   first time in four years. Tablets climbed 4% to a score of 78,   inching ahead of laptops, which gained 3% to 77.""In an increasingly mobile world, smartphones are the biggest   threat to PC sales, and tablets have not been the long-term   panacea the PC industry was hoping for,"" said ACSI Chairman Claes   Fornell in a press release.And while it seems odd that consumers prefer the somewhat   outdated desktop form factor, ACSI Managing Director David   VanAmburg explained why in an email to The Motley Fool.""Consumers like the convenience and mobility of laptops and   tablets, but the user experience can't hold up to desktops on   many levels,"" he wrote. ""Larger monitors, better speakers, and   more powerful processors are a factor. Also, desktops are   typically connected to the Internet via a landline as opposed to   Wi-Fi, which may contribute to a better quality online experience   than laptops and tablets can offer.""Image source: ACSI.Which manufacturers are on top?When it comes to PC manufacturers -- which includes desktop,   laptop, and tablet makers -- consumers remain enthralled withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which equaled its score from last year at 84.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) climbed by 6.4% to snag second place at 83,   whileAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , which only makes tablets, jumped 2.6% to 80 for   the No. 3 slot.Acer,ASUS, and Dell all tied for fourth at 78 andHP, despite finishing down the list, gained 5.5% to 77.LenovoandToshibaalso gained while the  combined score for all other, smaller   PC manufacturers dropped 3.9% to last place.""Interestingly, the two companies that lead in smartphone   satisfaction also lead the PC industry, although they have very   different strategies regarding the future of tablets,""   said Fornell. ""Apple is targeting business customers on the   go with laptop-like features for its iPad, while Samsung tablets   occupy their own space as devices for entertainment and browsing   -- not laptop replacements.""Image source: ACSI.Overall, consumers continue to rate design (size, visual   appeal) as the strongest aspect for PCs, although that number   dropped from 84 last year to 83. On the positive side, ease of   operation climbed from 80 to 81 while ability to keep crashes to   a minimum inched up from 79 to 80.Satisfaction with availability of software, apps, or   accessories and with processor speed all dropped from last   year.What does this mean?While it's unlikely that desktop PCs will ever stage a major   sales comeback, it's clear that laptops and tablets may have a   hard time completely replacing them. IDC reported in July that PC   shipments -- including desktops, portables, ultraslim notebooks,   Chromebooks, and workstations -- in the second quarter totaled   62.4 million units, a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which was   better than the forecast of a 7.4% decline.Even as the other devices become more useful, with better   technology, and the line between the two continues to blur, it's   obvious that consumers still want the power and monitor size   possible with a desktop.Those advantages may dim going forward, but for now, even   though sales have fallen, desktops still make the most sense for   some of us.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Why Apple Inc.

Niles said that ignoring the fact   that the company ""burns 3.6 billion"" in channel inventory, it   only really needs to grow revenues about 1% sequentially.""Over the last four years, it's been 6 to 7 percent that   they've averaged in September,"" he said.Second, carriers are again subsidizing iPhones, and this,   Niles believes, would make many customers upgrade. Lastly, thevaluationis great.""Apple gets a nice combination of defense with a nice, big   yield.""In other Apple news, the rivalry between Apple andSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) is set to intensify further as the U.S. firm is planning to   open a new Apple Store very close to Samsung's HQ in Seoul, South   Korea, according to aWall Street Journalreport.10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio       Right NowThis indeed is really close, and according to people familiar   with the matter, this move can prove very beneficial to the   iPhone maker.

Has Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 Lost Its Shine in Just a Week? (AAPL);9/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been in stores for one week now, and it has been a roller-coaster ride - for the phones' reputation andApple stockalike - ever since.First the iPhone 7s were dismissed as being dull incremental updates. Then they were surprisingly good. But as consumers got their hands on them, iPhone 7 issues started popping up, and now the list keeps growing.makeArticleAd();The latest is a complaint that phone-call sound quality is distorted.Source: AppleIs the iPhone 7 losing its unexpected shinealready?iPhone 7 Surprised ManyThe early expectations for the iPhone 7 weren't great. The new iPhone looked almost identical to the old one and the one before that. All the cool stuff - a curved OLED screen and no buttons at all on the front - wason hold for the iPhone 8. And there was considerable anger over the decision to ax the headphone jack.But as reviewers got their hands on the new iPhone, the narrative began to change.Facebook Overestimated a Critical Video Metric     for Years (FB)Subtle tweaks Apple made to the iPhone 7, like re-routing the antenna band to make it less obvious, added up. The new Jet Black finish option was gorgeous. And with theSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note exploding battery crisis, maybe Apple was right to have kept a proven design rather than to take risks by pushing the envelope.The water resistance worked even better than expected. Thedisplay was a work of arteven if it was just LCD. The A10 Fusion CPU was a performance monster, and the dual-camera optical zoom of the iPhone 7 Plus was pushing out some incredible images when given to pro photographers.Add in the boosted base storage - 32GB up from 16GB - and the iPhone 7 was turning into a sleeper hit.The List of iPhone 7 Issues is Adding UpHowever, in the week since actual consumers got their hands on the new iPhone, the list of complaints has been growing. Most are minor issues, but many are the sort of thing you simply wouldn't expect from Apple.Among the iPhone 7 issues currently being tracked:Extreme and excessive scratching of the Jet Black   version.New solid state Home button complaints that ""Taptic Engine""   feels unnatural, and the buttondoesn't work with many touch-enabled winter   glovesand protective cases.Consumer Reportsreleasestest results of iPhone 7 camera, says ""So far, we've found no major leap in camera performance   from the iPhone 6s models.""Lightning EarPods remote failingwith the iPhone 7.Reports that some iPhone 7 Plus owners are experiencing loud   hissing noises from their smartphone - also known as ""Hissgate.""And the latest, which started popping up on user forums over the past few days: Some iPhone 7 users are experiencingpoor or distorted audio when taking voice calls.Yes, people do still use smartphones for making calls, so this is a problem.Did Apple Drop the Ball Despite Playing It Safe?None of these iPhone 7 issues is anywhere near the severity of those exploding Galaxy Notes. Most of the technical issues like the hissing affect a relatively small number of users and only under specific circumstances. The scratchy finish? Appledidwarn buyers up front that the Jet Black scratches easily. The camera testing is refuted by many professional photographers, and evenConsumer Reportsadmitted the iPhone 7 Plus scored a noticeable zoom improvement with that second lens.The reality is what looks like playing it safe with the iPhone 7 actually involved some very significant technical leaps by Apple. The A10 Fusion CPU is the company's first move to a quad-core processor in an iPhone. The Home button is step one in eliminating the button altogether. The dual-camera system is expected to kickstart the feature in smartphones in general.Overall, though, there's a growing sense that AAPL is slipping when it comes to quality control.The ""old"" Apple probably wouldn't have released an iPhone that can become very noticeably and permanently marred after one day of use. It would have caught the EarPods that keep crapping out, especially given the sensitivity over forcing people to go the Lighting route instead of the headphone jack.Perhaps worse, the growing list of issues has the potential to take the shine off the iPhone 7 and even slow its sales.Bottom LineThere are two major takeaways for the company and Apple stock holders out of this past week:First, Apple needs to get on top of the issues. Replace any defective iPhones, nail the cause and fix any related components or production issues.  Second, it needs to learn from the iPhone 7 launch and double down on quality control for the iPhone 8.Apple Inc. (AAPL): McClaren Would Be a Good Fit     for Apple CarThis year, with low expectations and a flailing rival in the background, Apple got a break. But if the iPhone 8 has a similar list of woes, 2017 will be an iPhone 10th anniversary that Apple won't much enjoy celebrating.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio     Right NowApple Inc.

How Long Do Android and iPhone Owners Keep Their Phones?;9/22/2016;"Every time a newApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone gets released, it seems like everyone who   has chosen iOS overAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Android immediately orders   one.In reality, however, not every consumer trades in his or her   phone just because a new model comes out. They may want to, but   leasing cycles, payment plans, and other factors influence   whether people swap out their iPhone or Android phone after a new   model is released.On the Apple side, consumers are actually holding onto their   phones slightly longer, while with Android, the replacement cycle   has been steady for the past three years, according to data fromConsumer Intelligence Research Partners(CIRP).makeArticleAd();""Our earlier analysis of iPhone age indicates that the average   age of an upgraded iPhone increased by more than three months   over three years, while the age of upgraded Android phones   increased by less than one month,"" said CIRP founder Josh   Lowitz.People are holding onto their iPhones longer according to a   new study. Image source: Apple.Why are iPhone users waiting longer?It's important to note that there are some key differences   between iPhone and Android phones. The most notable is that only   Apple makes iPhones and the company has stuck to a rigorous   upgrade cycle for the past few years. It releases a new model   every year around September, but only issues a major refresh   every other year.In the Android world, there are dozens of manufacturers making   phones. That makes it possible that an Android user might be   tempted to switch due to new features on a more regular basis (or   maybe just because having the latest thing is cool).""We identified two potential reasons why iPhone upgrade timing   has slowed: more incremental changes in features, and phone   financing plans,"" said Lowitz ""Only the latter of these factors,   phone financing, would apply similarly to Android phone upgrade   timing. Other factors, including the ability to switch between   manufacturers and remain within the Android operating system, the   variety of features offered by different manufacturers, and the   price competition that comes with multiple options, appear to   lead to earlier upgrades.""What does this mean for manufacturers?For Apple, a company that makes roughly 56% profit from its   phone line, longer upgrade waits directly hit the bottom line. In   recent years, the feature and appearance upgrades from model to   model have been small enough that an increasing percentage of   users are waiting. That has been especially true during the ""s""   years when the company simply upgrades its existing phone rather   than introduce a new one.In the Android world, faster upgrade cycles create   opportunity, but the competition between brands is intense.Among the various Android brands, loyalty varies greatly,""   said CIRP co-founder Mike Levin. ""Since the June 2013 quarter,   Samsung leads in loyalty, with 77% ofSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) consumers activating another Samsung phone.   Loyalty trails significantly for other leading Android handset   brands, ranging from 39% forLGto 25% forHTC.""For Apple, it's not time to worry too much, but a slowing   replacement cycle is a concern. The challenge, now that even   low-end Android phones offer some pretty fancy features, is   making a new phone with features people are willing to spend more   money to have. That's a very high bar that may not be met by a   new color, faster processor, or the other bells and whistles   offered on the iPhone 7.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Samsung’s Explosive Problem Could Be Good News for Apple Inc.;9/21/2016;"Samsung Galaxy Note7. Image source: Samsung.The timing ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) voluntary recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note7   smartphones could not have come at a better time forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which just released the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.   Let's take a closer at what led to the recall and the boost this   could have for iPhone sales.The exploding smartphoneAs far as brand image goes, it doesn't get much worse for a   company than having one of its flagship devices burst into flames   all over the country, especially when it's something that many   customers keep in their pockets and hold up to their heads on a   regular basis.makeArticleAd();Unfortunately for Samsung, that's exactly what happened with   the Note7, released in mid-August. In the ensuing weeks, the   media reported dozens of cases where the lithium-ion batteries in   the Note7 have spontaneously caught fire and exploded. While   this is a small number relative to the 2.5 million units sold   worldwide since the release, Samsung didn't want to risk further   incidents and decided to halt sales and issue a voluntary recall   of the phone. Depending on where customers purchased the device,   they can receive a replacement phone with a new battery directly   from Samsung, a refund, or an exchange for a different model.And Samsung's problems keep getting worse. There were reports   over the past weekend that a 6 year-old boy in New York suffered   burns and was rushed to the hospital after the Note7 he was   playing with exploded in his hand. This news follows earlier   reports from around the world of explosions that have led to   fires in homes, hotel rooms, and cars. Samsung's stock is   down a little over 5% since the recall was announced -- wiping   out a over $10 billion of market value and resulting in shake-up   of leadership at the company.The impact on SamsungThe Note7 recall has been a major blow to Samsung's efforts to   gain market share in the competitive smartphone market and could   have a lasting impact on its brand image. Third quarter results   are expected to take up to a $900 million hit as a result of lost   sales and recall costs.Analysts are now expecting sales of around six million units   of the Note7 in the third and fourth quarters, significantly   lower than earlier estimates of 12 million to 15 million units.   The Note7 fiasco could also cast a shadow over Samsung's S8   smartphone launch in early 2017.How Apple can benefitApple's financial results are largely dependent on the success   of the iPhone. Fiscal third quarter revenue declined 15%   year-over-year to $42.3 billion, largely a result of selling 15%   fewer iPhones. Fears of market saturation for its best-selling   product and the implications from the declining revenue caused   the stock to hit a 52-week low of $89.47 in May, though it has   since recovered almost 20%. The launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus   could help reverse the falling revenue, and carriers are already   reporting strong pre-orders for the new smartphone, although   Apple hasn't released any specific sales figures.According toT-Mobilepresident and CEO John Legere, ""iPhone 7 is the biggest preorder   in T-Mobile's history, and that says a lot about our momentum and   the excitement customers have for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus!""Sprintsaid the first three days of pre-orders of the iPhone 7 and 7   Plus are up more than 375% over the first three days of   pre-orders from the previous iPhone launch. Based on strong   anticipated demand, and in the wake of the Note7 recall, Apple   reportedly increased its order for parts and components used in   the new devices' production by 10% earlier this month.If Samsung has further issues with the Note7, or future   smartphone models, it could be a devastating blow to the   company's growing smartphone business and a boon for Apple and   other competitors. It's hard to know the exact correlation   between Samsung's explosive problem and a successful iPhone   launch, but the timing was rather fortuitous and could result in   a sizable sales bump for Apple in the coming quarters.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

The company has sent out 500,000 of the smartphones, which is enough to cover about half of the devices affected by the battery recall.makeArticleAd();Samsung said that stores should have the remaining 500,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphone replacementsby the end of the month. The company also noted that 25% of Galaxy Note 7 owners have exchanged their devices and that the majority didn't choose a refund.Samsung is also releasing an update for the Galaxy Note 7 that will urge owners to exchange it whenever it is turned on or plugged in for charging. Those that do replace their smartphones with the new version will notice that it displays a green battery symbol. This was done to make it easier for customers to determine if they had a new version of the smartphone, reports Cnet.There's also a Galaxy Note 7recall pagethat owners can use to identify if their device needs to be exchanged. Samsung+ can also be used to automatically check if the device needs replaced. Select carriers are also offering a $25 gift card if users switch to a new Note 7 instead of taking the refund.The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall was announced onSept. 2.

Why the iPhone 7 Will Be a Success;9/20/2016;"Apple's(AAPL) new iPhone 7 has defied all criticism as the device is already in hot demand. So much so that Apple is struggling to meet demand. Out of all the problems that Apple could have had, failing to meet demand is probably the best thing that could have happened to the company. Apple should be able to cater to the demand soon, which is why the stock looks attractive right now.An Amazing Promotion Offer by Domestic CarriersmakeArticleAd();All U.S. carriers have started offering consumers an iPhone 7 for free in exchange for their iPhone 6 or newer. Although carriers have proposed various offers whenever a new iPhone is launched, this offer is specifically belligerent.The promotion basically proposes a $65… trade-in value for any iPhone 6 series model. Moving onward, the trade-in value promotion is based on a two year contract, so as to create lock-in. A consumer has to pay extra if they want to buy a 7 Plus with additional storage.Warren Buffett Recent BuysThe carriers attempt to steal consumers from each other by proposing various types of offers, and every year the promotions are getting progressively more belligerent. As an outcome, Apple is the major beneficiary as carriers will have to pay no matter what.Exploding Note 7 Is a Plus for Apple iPhone 7Samsung(SSNLF) is the most significant competitor of Apple. The company has introduced some astonishing smartphones such as its Galaxy S series. A few months back, Samsung launched its new flagship models Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung got huge benefits from Galaxy S7 series as both the models successfully outperformed the smartphone market and managed to become the world's top smartphones.However, the company recently launched its new flagship device Galaxy Note 7, skipping its Note 6 model, to compete against Apple's new iPhone 7, which has proved to be a thorn in its side. Shortly after the launch of Galaxy Note 7, it was found that some of the devices started exploding or catching fire. Not only will this affect Samsung's performance this year, many users will likely shift to Apple's iPhone 7 because of this.Recently, one galaxy Note 7 exploded in a man's pocket. Samsung is well aware of the problem and has declared an official recall worldwide. The company is putting in efforts to solve this issue, but this incident has badly affected the company's image, which is surely a plus point for the Apple iPhone 7.ConclusionThe trends point towards a very successful iPhone 7, which is great news for Apple investors as the company generates majority of its revenue from the flagship device. Although the stock enjoyed its best week in five years this month, I think it can easily move higher from current levels.Disclosure:No PositionStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Read More:Global Central Bank Policy in Focus for Stocks     WednesdayStrong Financial Strength Scores Lead To     Increased Value OpportunitiesRetailers Under Pressure as Food Price Decline     DeepensAbout GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to be moving to OLED technology for its next generation iPhone 8 next year. That expectation has some people sitting out the iPhone 7. However, testing shows the new iPhone matches or breaks seven smartphone display performance records, including those previously held by devices using OLED.Source: AppleMaybe there's no need to wait after all?makeArticleAd();And for that matter, should AAPL even bother with the effort of transitioning to OLED for its next new iPhone?iPhone 7 Display Shatters RecordsDisplayMateis a website with a well-deserved reputation for being the authority on display technology. Whether it's a 4K TV or a smartphone,DisplayMate Technologiestests it thoroughly and provides a detailed performance analysis.10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun GoogleAfter testing AAPL's new iPhones,DisplayMatepublished results showing theiPhone 7 either met or broke seven records for smartphone displays. Summing up the findings, the reviewer wrote:""The iPhone 7 display is a Truly Impressive major enhancement and advancement on the iPhone 6 display… and even every other mobile LCD display that we have ever tested.""TheDisplayMaterecords the iPhone 7 met or set are:Highest absolute color accuracyHighest absolute luminance accuracyAccuracy of image contrast and intensityHighest contrast ratio for IPS LCDLowest screen reflectanceHighest contrast rating in high ambient lightSmallest color variation with viewing angleTo put all that in plain English, the iPhone 7 display is as good as it gets right now for outdoors use (bright and with minimal reflection), the color is dead on, so what you see onscreen is true to life, and it looks great even when you view it from an angle.Keep in mind, many of these records saw the new iPhone 7 beat out smartphones employing OLED technology for their displays.Will Apple Still Switch to OLED (or AMOLED) in 2017?Given that the Retina LCD display in the iPhone 7 is killing it, will AAPL still gamble on switching to OLED technology as predicted for next year's iPhone 8?The answer is yes.While AAPL has been incredibly successful at squeezing impressive performance out of LED, it will be hitting a ceiling. Making a new iPhone with an LCD display that outshines the iPhone 7's is going to be extremely difficult.More importantly, OLED offers advantages that will be critical to the design of the next iPhone. With flexible OLED displays, a newiPhone 8 can offer the curvesthatSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has been adding to its Galaxy phones. In addition, OLED is more power efficient than LCD and OLED displays are thinner. Considering the value AAPL puts on visual design, shaving fractions of an inch off its iPhones and optimizing CPUs to squeeze more battery life out of them, these factors alone make the transition to OLED a no-brainer.In the meantime, consumers who purchase an iPhone 7 now will be getting one of the best smartphone displays on the planet - despite the fact that it's using ""outdated"" technology.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceiPhone 7 Reviews Are In: Apple Inc.

1 More Surprise Winner Inside the Apple Inc. iPhone 7;9/19/2016;"Image source: Getty.TheApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus officially hit store   shelves on Sept. 16, and it wasn't long beforeChipworkspublished a tear-down report showing the chips inside these new   smartphones.makeArticleAd();There is a lot of neat stuff going on inside Apple's latest   smartphones, but the Chipworks tear-down report revealed a new   design win that could be interesting for a small and relatively   unknown chipmaker.An FPGA inside the iPhoneAccording to Chipworks the iPhone 7 contains a field   programmable gate array, or FPGA, from a small FPGA specialist   calledLattice Semiconductor(NASDAQ: LSCC) .A good explanation of what an FPGA is comes from another FPGA   manufacturer,Xilinx:FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or     functionality requirements after manufacturing. This feature     distinguishes FPGAs from Application Specific Integrated     Circuits (ASICs), which are custom manufactured for specific     design tasks.Chipworks says that it found an FPGA from Lattice carrying the   model number ""ICE5LP4K.""Based on the model number of this chip, it would seem that we   are looking at the highest-end member of Lattice Semi's iCE40   Ultra family of FPGAs. According to the data sheet for the iCE40   Ultra family of FPGAs, it is ""an ultra-low-power FPGA and sensor   manager designed for ultra-low-power mobile applications such as   smartphones, tablets, and hand-held devices.""Given the programmable nature of FPGAs, it's hard to know what   exactly what Apple is using this chip for.Image Source: Lattice Semiconductor.What could this mean for Lattice?In an investor presentation accompanying its earnings call   last month, the company said that its revenue in the second   quarter ""benefited from ramping Tier 1 customer OEM win.""   Additionally, it expects ""double-digit revenue growth"" during the   current quarter driven partially by ""ramping Tier 1 Consumer OEM   wins.""It's clear that at least some of Lattice's confidence came   from the fact that it would be entering the iPhone 7 supply   chain.The good news for Lattice is that tear-downs of the   previous-generation iPhone 6s and 6s Plus didn't show the   presence of a Lattice FPGA. This should mean that the iPhone 7   and 7 Plus represent nothing but upside for the   programmable-logic specialist.It's hardly a given, though, that Lattice will be able to   maintain its spot inside future iPhones. Perhaps Apple is merely   using an FPGA as a stopgap solution until it can build a   specialized chip to perform the task that it currently uses the   FPGA for.For example, the the Chipworks tear-down of theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S5 revealed a Lattice FPGA, but its   tear-down of the later Galaxy S7 Edge doesn't show a Lattice chip   insideThe good news is that in the here and now, Lattice is poised   to benefit from the sales cycle for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.Additionally, even if Lattice's chips aren't used in the   iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple calls its next iPhone), the company   should still generate revenue from sales of the iPhone 7 and 7   Plus when they become Apple's mid-range product offerings --   though the year-over-year comparison would become unfavorable for   Lattice.On the flip side, if Lattice's chips are chosen for the iPhone   8, then the company should see revenue growth -- at least in the   Apple-related portion of its business -- from the fact that its   chips will be in both Apple's latest smartphone and its mid-range   offering.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sales Skew Toward iPhone 7 Plus;9/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) maynot be releasing official presale numbers, but that doesn't mean we're totally in the dark. Data collected bySlice Intelligencesuggests that this time around, consumers are shelling out the extra for the iPhone 7 Plus.Source: AppleSlice Intelligencecompiled data from e-receipts for new iPhone sales from online retailers during the first 48 hours of availability to prepare thisreport on iPhone 7 pre-orders.makeArticleAd();The data shows a significant shift in consumer demand, and it's one that favors AAPL stock.For the first time, the larger iPhone option is outselling the standard size, with the iPhone 7 Plus accounting for 55% of pre-order volume. In comparison, the original iPhone 6 Plus accounted for 35% of presales, and the iPhone 6s Plus took 41%.If you're hoping for black, you may have to wait a bit. The numbers suggest 69% of buyers are opting for either Black or Jet Black.More iPhone 7 Plus Sales Good News for AppleApple's larger iPhone has traditionally carried a larger profit margin for AAPL than the standard-size model. The company has priced the iPhone Plus at a slight premium, reflecting its flagship status.Apple Inc. (AAPL): The iPhone 7 Is Crushing the     BearsFor example, theiPhone 6 cost $200 to make with a $649 price tag for a 69% profit margin. The 6 Plus cost $216, but sold for $749 - a 71% margin.This time around, we don't have specific parts costs yet, but it's a safe assumption that the same basic math applies. The new dual lens camera in the iPhone 7 Plus might be bumping its production cost slightly compared to previous years. In addition, Apple increased storage on new iPhones across the board from 16GB to 32GB. However, theSlice Intelligencedata suggests 67% of all iPhone buyers to date have paid the extra for the 128GB storage upgrade, offsetting any additional expenses AAPL may have incurred in boosting base storage.This year, AAPL also boosted the starting price of the iPhone 7 Plus to $769 - likely accounting for that camera.When the numbers are crunched, expect the iPhone 7 Plus to once again carry a higher profit margin. That means the trend toward customers going big when they choose their new iPhone is good news for AAPL.Why Is the iPhone 7 Plus More Popular?Tablets sales have been steadily dropping and one of the factors blamed for this has been the use of phablets. Large smartphones - like the iPhone 7 Plus - can take the place of a tablet for many people. The increased iPhone 7 Plus sales may reflect this trend continuing, with iPhone upgraders opting to buy a smartphone that will replace both their older iPhoneandtheir aging iPad.The dual-lens camera in the iPhone 7 Plus is is the most likely culprit, though.In previous generations, AAPL has offered optical image stabilization only on the Plus. That's a nice feature, but other than that the camera systems on the two phones has been identical. In contrast, this year the iPhone 7 Plus has a dramatically superior camera with optical zoom capability - something no iPhone (and very few smartphones in general) ever offered previously.Withstunning photos taken with the iPhone 7 Plusmaking headlines, it seems likely that consumers are impressed enough to start snapping up the more expensive new iPhone.The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy     NowWhatever the reason, Apple has to be happy with the current trend. If the presale numbers fromSlice Intelligencecontinue to hold up and the iPhone 7 Plus continues to be the most popular new iPhone, that represents a nice boost to AAPL's bottom line.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to SeeApple Inc.

The iPhone's Toughest Competitor Is the iPhone Itself;9/15/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) makes more than 60% of revenue from the iPhone   segment, so competitive dynamics in the smartphone industry are   remarkably important for investors in the company, especially now   that Apple has recently launched its brand-new iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus models.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, the biggest competitor for the iPhone is   arguably not the latest smartphone fromSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) or some other industry player, but previous   versions of the iPhone itself. This can be a headwind for Apple   in terms of growth opportunities in the short term, but it also   has big positive implications for investors.Apple is one of a kindApple owns one of the most valuable brands in the world, and   Apple users are remarkably loyal to the company. The Fortune   Brands Ranking considers Apple the most valuable brand on the   planet, with an estimated value of $154.1 billion. Competitor   Samsung comes in 11th, according to the publication, the Samsung   brand is reportedly worth $36.1 billion.Even better, the competitive gap between Apple and Samsung   seems to be widening lately, as the iPhone 7 is off to a strong   start, while Samsung is facing serious problems with the Galaxy   Note 7. The South Korean manufacturer has recalled 2.5 million   Note 7s after dozens of cases in which batteries exploded or   caught fire. This is an important issue in terms of customer   safety, and it will probably inflict considerable damage to   Samsung's reputation.On the other hand, bothT-Mobile US(NASDAQ: TMUS) andSprint Corporation(NYSE: S) announced on Tuesday that demand for the iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus looks encouragingly strong. According to T-Mobile,   the iPhone 7 is the biggest pre-order in T-Mobile's history, and   Sprint said pre-orders of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are up   more than 375% in the first three days over the same period last   year.Apple has a pricing disadvantage versus lower-cost   competitors, limiting market share potential in emerging markets   where income levels are lower and the carrier subsidy model is   not as extended as in the United States. However, when it comes   to competing in the higher end of the pricing spectrum, Apple   comes second to none.The iPhone versus the iPhoneMost customers don't renew their smartphone every year.   According to a survey from Gallup, only 2% of iPhone users in the   U.S. upgrade their devices when a new model is released, while   51% of respondents renew their models as soon as the cell-phone   provider allows it, generally every two years. Based on data from   this survey, 54% of iPhone customers in the U.S. only upgrade   their devices when they stop working or become totally   obsolete.The iPhone 7 is better than previous iPhone models, and it's   also superior to most products from the competition. However, the   product is no game-changer in comparison with the iPhone 6 or the   iPhone 6s. Since many Apple customers already own an iPhone, we   could say that the main challenge for the iPhone 7 is persuading   customers to get rid of their older phones and change them for   the latest iPhone. In a sense, the iPhone is its own biggest   competitor, and Apple is a victim of its own success.The bright sideThe fact that previous iPhone models are good enough for many   consumers can be a limitation when it comes to introducing new   versions. On the other hand, this is a nice problem to have, as   its speaks volumes about the quality and resiliency of the   business.The iPhone installed base is gargantuan. Apple announced in   July that it has sold over 1 billion smartphones. Once the user   becomes entrenched in the Apple ecosystem of software, services,   and applications, chances are that such user will continue   choosing Apple products when buying a new smartphone, a tablet, a   computer, or a smartwatch.Importantly, a massive installed base of Apple products is a   major driver for Apple in the services division. This segment   includes revenue from the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Pay,   Apple Care, and other services. Apple generated nearly $6 billion   in sales from this business last quarter, with revenue growing   19% versus the same quarter in the prior year.The main problem for the iPhone 7 is not necessarily   smartphones from the competition, but previous iPhone models that   are still good enough for many consumers. This trend can limit   growth potential on a short-term basis, but it's also an   enormously valuable strategic asset for investors in Apple over   the long term.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Why HP Inc.'s Deal With Samsung Could Be a Game Changer;9/15/2016;"It may come as a surprise, given all the gloom-and-doom talk   surrounding the ""dying"" PC market, butHP(NYSE: HPQ) is more than holding its own. Last quarter was a   great example of CEO Dion Weisler and team delivering on their   strategic objective of targeting niche markets within the   struggling PC market, and HP's fiscal third quarter 2016 made it   clear the plan is on target.The same can't be said for HP's other division, printing. If   not for a woeful quarter of printing-related sales, HP would have   really surprised bearish pundits in Q3. Unfortunately, it was not   to be. But a recent move by Weisler to ""disrupt"" a stagnant   copier industry and bolster HP's bevy of printing solutions will   be an absolute game changer for years to come.A billion-dollar bargainIn an effort to ""reinvent and replace service-intensive   copiers with superior multifunction printing,"" HP recently inked   a $1.05 billion deal with longtime partnerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for the South Korean conglomerate's printer   unit. The acquisition is the largest printing-related deal in   HP's long history.makeArticleAd();According to HP, the copier market ""hasn't innovated in   decades,"" and with an estimated $55 billion in global sales   available for the taking, a printer-copier combination utilizing   today's technology, including the cloud and enhanced data   security, could turn HP's woeful printing unit on its head.Samsung's printing unit includes ""a formidable portfolio of A3   MFPs"" (multifunction printers) for the traditional printing   market, some of which have a mere seven replaceable parts. As for   sales, Samsung brought in $1.8 billion in printing revenue in   fiscal 2015, which is a drop in the bucket compared to HP's $13.7   billion so far in fiscal 2016.However, the deal involves a great deal more than simply   rebranding and selling Samsung products. HP intends to combine   its PageWide technology -- which improves quality, boosts   efficiency, and reduces user costs -- with Samsung MFPs to   develop a new generation of printers. And that's just the   start.Just as important to the deal are the ancillary assets that   come with the $1.05 billion check HP will write sometime in the   next 12 months, which is when the acquisition is expected to   close. HP will retain nearly 1,300 Samsung engineers and   researchers to bolster its own research and development   efforts.And what could prove to be the most valuable aspect of the   deal is the portfolio of ""more than 6,500 printing patents"" that   will come along with the talent and the products. Samsung   has also agreed to invest $100 million to $300 million in HP   stock purchased on the open market once the regulatory hurdles   are cleared.Image source:HP.Where to from here?HP's $11.9 billion in revenue last quarter was a 4% decline   compared to the year-ago period -- that's the bad news. The good   news is that its personal systems unit -- home of HP's PC-related   sales -- actually improved, albeit slightly, to $7.51 billion   from last year's $7.5 billion.Notebooks, in particular, performed admirably in Q3, with   sales climbing 8%, to $4.3 billion -- easily making it the   personal systems team's top revenue driver. HP's focus on niche   markets, such as its new OMEN virtual-reality-ready notebooks and   desktops, drove an increase in PC sales and the segment's share   of the overall market in calendar Q2.As for printing, the 14% drop in sales last quarter, to $4.4   billion, was led by a whopping 18% decline in supplies revenue.   But along with the Samsung deal, Weisler has a plan to address   that shortcoming. For one, HP will focus on selling high-end   enterprise printers to increase supply sales. And HP's leadership   position in both commercial and consumer 3D printing will also   give it a boost going forward.According to one estimate, 3D printing will generate $7   billion in revenue this year, up just $1 billion from 2014.   However, two years from now the market is expected to skyrocket   to $13 billion, and it is predicted to soar to $21 billion by   2020. Printing is HP's Achilles' heel today, but the Samsung   acquisition, supplies sales strategy, and a burgeoning 3D market   will make that a thing of the past.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Why Apple Inc. Didn’t Include OLED Displays on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus;9/15/2016;"Image source: Apple.With this year's iPhones,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made a number of enhancements to the displays -- a   critical part of the user experience -- relative to last year's   models. The new displays support the much wider DCI-P3 color   gamut for better color saturation and are substantially brighter   -- 25% brighter, according to the iDevice maker. These   changes imply that Apple is using an all-new liquid-crystal   display (commonly abbreviated LCD) backlight in this device, as   brightness and color gamut in an LCD are largely dictated by the   backlight.makeArticleAd();To the disappointment of some, Apple did not use an Organic   Light Emitting Diode, or OLED, display in the new iPhone. OLEDs   have a number of advantages over LCDs, with two obvious ones   being that they can deliver substantially enhanced contrast   relative to LCDs, improving image quality, and the fact that they   can be curved as inSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recent flagships.Apple is expected to use curved OLED displays on its   next-generation iPhones, but this year, Apple stuck to LCDs,   knowing full well that doing so could put it at a marketing   disadvantage relative to Samsung and other smartphone makers. And   to be blunt, Apple isn't stupid.The question, then, is ""why?""It looks like an issue of technological     readinessIt may seem as though Apple merely buys displays and has very   little involvement with the underlying technology that goes into   them. Apple's secrecy means that it doesn't talk about this sort   of thing, but the company has hired a substantial number of   display technologists. These engineers likely work closely with   the major display manufacturers to build products that meet   Apple's exacting specifications.In order for Apple to choose to adopt OLED displays, it needs   to be sure that the new displays will bring with them all of the   advantages traditionally associated with OLEDs while at the same   time not regressing in any key way relative to the best   LCDs. To be blunt, I don't think Apple could have adopted   OLEDs this year without making significant sacrifices.For example, according to AnandTech's testing, the display   found on the Note7 -- arguably the best smartphone OLED display   in the market today -- only achieves a maximum brightness of 359   nits. The iPhone 6s Plus, which Apple rates at 500 nits of   brightness, actually manages to achieve 582 nits in AnandTech's   tests.The iPhone 7 Plus' display, which Apple rates at 625 nits of   brightness, could very well achieve over 700 nits of brightness   if the delta between Apple's rating and measured brightness holds   for the iPhone 7/7 Plus as it did with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, and   even iPhone 6/6 Plus.If, with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, Apple is able to achieve   best-in-class color/grayscale/saturation accuracy (the key   metrics that AnandTech tests) combined with an extremely bright   display, then I would argue that using a similar panel to the   ones found on the Note7 or S7/S7 Edge would have been an   unacceptable regression in a number of key ways.Apple Watch 2 paints a bright picture for the 2017     iPhoneInterestingly, Apple has already adopted OLED displays in the   Apple Watch, and at its Sept. 7 product launch event, talked up   the display improvements on the second-generation Apple Watch. In   particular, the iDevice maker claims that the Apple Watch 2's   display is extremely bright and capable of emitting 1000 nits of   light. If Apple and its display partner(s) are able to scale this   technology up for use on next year's iPhones, then next year's   iPhone displays could be unequivocally better than this   year's.Implications for Apple's iPhone bizI suspect that many of Apple's competitors will increasingly   shift OLEDs in a bid to differentiate their offerings over the   coming months. Even if those displays are inferior to Apple's   LCDs in a number of key areas, those competitors will likely use   the ""we have OLEDs and Apple doesn't"" marketing angle to try to   maintain/gain share at the high end of the smartphone market.Unfortunately, this is a marketing disadvantage that Apple is   going to have to live with over the course of this product cycle.

iPhone 7 Reviews Are In: Apple Inc. Delivered in Spades;9/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPre-orders are starting to ship, the early iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus reviews are in. While it's not perfect - and the missing headphone jack continues to be a point of concern - the consensus seems to be thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has delivered two very good smartphones.Source: AppleAnd as a result,Apple stock continues to soar.makeArticleAd();iPhone 7 Reviews Are GlowingOne of the points that everyone has been talking about is the performance of the iPhone 7. Every year, AAPL touts the speed increases of the latest AX chip in the new iPhones, but the A10 Fusion in the iPhone 7 seems pretty special.Apple Insidersays: ""The A10 Fusion is a giant advance over the A9 processorin iPhone 6s"" and points out that in addition to delivering increased battery life, the iPhone 7 delivers better performance than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.Water resistance has been high on the wish list of Apple fans, and this year, the company delivered. The iPhone 7 carried an IP67 rating, good for being submerged in 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. TheWall Street Journal'sJoanna Stern went swimming for two hours with hers, shooting underwater photos and video. She reports that after three days, all is well. This might void the Apple warranty, but action camera makers likeGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) will be watching this development nervously.The iPhone 8 Will Be a 10th Anniversary     MasterpieceThe killer feature that virtually everyone agrees on is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus: its new dual-lens camera system with optical zoom.BGRsays the iPhone 7 Plus ""camera isabsolutely jaw-dropping and best-in-class."" However, in testing both iPhone 7 models deliver a big improvement in low-light photos.Battery life has improved considerably - reviewers are seeing an extra two hours or so a day. The move from 16GB to 32GB for base storage has been welcome, and the display is noticeably brighter than on previous iPhones, too.There Is Some Bad, HoweverThe Jet Black finish introduced for 128GB and up iPhone 7 models has been well received in terms of looks, but it's getting panned for easily scratching.Engadget'siPhone 7 review noted: ""It didn't even take 24 hours for the first batch of scratchesto appear on my jet black iPhone 7's back.""The Home button's switch from physical to capacitive with feedback hasn't been particularly popular.The Vergedescribes it this way: ""On the iPhone, the whole bottom of the phone just sort of 'kicks.' It's not bad haptics like you remember, with weird vibration, it's just a new kind of bad haptics. It doesn't feel like a button at all. It's a bummer.""Of course, there's that elephant in the room, the lack of headphone jack on the new iPhones.While there are plenty of workarounds - including the Lightning adapter Apple includes for free and Bluetooth - no one is particularly happy about the move. In his iPhone 7 review,Wired'sDavid Pierce is representative of the reaction. There's a lot of habitually trying to plug headphones into a jack that no longer exists, frustration when the adapter gets misplaced and annoyance over not being able to charge and listen to music simultaneously.He sums up his reaction to AAPL's move: ""I'm into the idea that wireless is the future, but getting there is going to be painful and adapter-filled.""The Big PictureMost outlets are reporting the iPhone 7 represents a big leap from the iPhone 6 and earlier. However, owners of an iPhone 6s are less likely to find it a compelling upgrade. The exception is people who use their smartphone as their primary camera, in which case the iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera system is well worth shelling out for.Analysts (and AAPL itself) seemed tentative about how well the iPhone 7 would be received. However, it seems to deliver much more than a typical incremental upgrade would. The new features, positive reviews and the negative press surroundingSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 may just combine to make the iPhone 7 an unexpected hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to SeeApple Inc.

Apple Inc. Gets an Explosive Lift to 2016 Highs (AAPL);9/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent tumult in the markets hasn't had much of an effect onApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Since the end of last week, AAPL shares have logged a hefty gain of 9%, including a 3%-plus bump today on heavy volume.Source:Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified)So maybeApple stockis a way to hedge against volatility - especially with the incessant jitters about interest rates as well as the wild presidential election?makeArticleAd();Perhaps.If anything, Apple stock is getting a big-time lift from the travails of one of its arch rivals,Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Yes, it's actually kind of hard to believe, but some of the new Galaxy Note 7 phones have apparently been blowing up (the culprit is the lithium-ion batteries). Someone even claimed his Jeep Grand Cherokeeburst into flamesbecause he charged his device in the car.10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun GoogleIt's like all this is straight out of Stephen King'sFirestarter.A Helping Hand From SamsungYet, as if things could have not gotten even worse, Samsung has been bumbling with its response. Keep in mind that just two weeks ago the company initiated avoluntary recall. But this was really just too feeble. After all, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has gone on to tell owners of the Note 7 to not use the device. Oh, and of course, airlines are also concerned, and have been telling their customers to turn off their phones.Another part of the Samsung response has been an exchange program. But for the most part, the details have been mostly a muddle of confusion for customers - probably because the process was not handled through the CPSC, which has not approved the replacement device. There is also a concern that there may not even be enough devices available anyway.In the meantime, AAPL has recently launched its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While they may not necessarily be a must-have devices, it probably does not matter. The fact is that the smartphone market is fairly mature. That is, growth is generally about gaining market share from competitors. So in light of the troubles at Samsung, is it any wonder that Apple stock is on a big run?Of course not.But the situation with Samsung could be much more than a short-term blip. When it comes to expensive devices - the Note comes at $800 - consumers can certainly be very discerning. This is often magnified when there is a loss of trust.For a perspective on this, look atBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY). Back in 2009, the company was the dominant player in the smartphone space. But because of poor product quality and recalls, BBRY eventually fizzled.Now, this is not to say the same fate will befall Samsung. For the most part, the company can turn things around. But it will definitely take time - and AAPL will not hold back on capitalizing on the situation. Even better, all this comes during the all-important holiday season.Great News for Apple StockAlready there are signs that AAPL is gaining traction. Check out the following:T-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) has reported that the new iPhone has""gone on to shatter all previous iPhone pre-order   records""at the company.Sprint Corp(NYSE:S) has announced that pre-orders are upnearly four times.It's important to note that - when it comes to Apple stock - about57% of overall revenues come from the iPhone. So an uptick can certainly move the needle.Tesla Motors Inc - How Much Worse Could It Get?     (TSLA)Besides, even with the run-up in Apple stock, the valuation is still reasonable. AAPL's price-earnings ratio is just 12 for crying out loud! By comparison,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at 17 times future earnings,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) sports a multiple of 13 andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is swapping hands at 19 times estimated earnings.There's a pretty good chance that growth will start to perk up again, meaning the upside on Apple stock could be especially roomy.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Will Be a 10th Anniversary Masterpiece;9/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsReviewers and consumers appear to be warming up to the iPhone 7 - at least according to thesurprising pre-order numbersfromT-Mobile US Inc(NYSE:TMUS). However, next year's iPhone 8 continues to shape up to be a design masterpiece forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).Source: AppleThat's because insiders say the iPhone will ditch the iconic home button, and the front will be an uninterrupted sheet of glass.makeArticleAd();iPhone 8 Will Be a 10th Anniversary MasterpieceIt's no secret that Apple's Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has a thing for glass. Whether that's in thedesign of Apple retail stores, or the front surface of your favorite iOS device, glass is a big design element. But he prefers a sweeping, minimalist look, free of obstructions.His vision for an iPhone 8 that incorporates an all-glass front has been frequently discussed. 2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, a major milestone in AAPL history. It also marks the start of a new cycle in Apple's new three-year iPhone release strategy. And the company could use a boost in sales after a year where new iPhones haven't been moving out the door the way they once did.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 7 Pre-Orders FOUR     Times Greater Than iPhone 6In other words, all the elements are in place for the iPhone 8 to make a big splash, and the centerpiece of the new design is looking to be an all-glass front.That means no Home button to disrupt the flow. The display is expected to be a flexible OLED version that's brighter than anything Apple has released to date. And, like rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), Apple is expected to offer at least one iPhone 8 version that has an actual curved display, wrapping around the sides.An iPhone 7 review in theNew York Timesincludesconfirmation from two anonymous Apple employeesthat next year's iPhone 8 will have an all-glass front. The Home button disappears, although its functionality will live on as a ""virtual button"" built into the screen.iPhone 7 Home Button Was Phase OneAs anyone who has used an iPhone or iPad knows that the Home button is a critical part of iOS. You can't simply eliminate it.However, the plan with the iPhone 8 is to change the Home button from being a physical button to a virtual one. The iPhone 7 is actually Phase One of this transition. The button itself is still there, but it doesn't operate as a physical button, Instead, AAPL employs its ""taptic engine"" technology. When a user presses the button, the new iPhone vibrates to give feedback.With the iPhone 8, AAPL would take the next step by eliminating the button altogether, instead incorporating the Home button features as a virtual button built into that glass front. It would use the ""taptic engine"" feedback being pioneered with the iPhone 7 and would have to incorporate TouchID sensors in the glass as well.Jony Ive would get his all-glass iPhone front. Meanwhile, consumers would get a win with the end of mechanical wear and tear on the most frequently pressed iPhone button, which should make the iPhone 8 even more durable.Perhaps most importantly - at least from a sales perspective - the iPhone 8 would look significantly different from all previous iPhones. That's a key selling point for consumers who want visual proof that they own the latest and greatest Apple gear.And key to Apple enjoying a killer 10th anniversary launch weekend.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to SeeLet the Stock Picks Come to YOU!The postApple Inc.

Apple Inc.: One of Warren Buffett’s New Dividend Stocks (AAPL);9/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) is ablue chip stockthat recently reinstated the dividend. Since becoming a dividend   payer again in 2012 (it wassuspendedfrom 1996-2011), they have increased the quarterly dividend by   50% from 38 cents per share to 57 cents.With a relatively low payout ratio, high returns on invested   capital, and an extremely valuable consumer brand, Apple looks   undervalued at only 13x 2016 earnings. Warren Buffet's   lieutenants certainty agree asBerkshire invested over a billion dollarsin the company this year.makeArticleAd();However, in a world where technology trendschange drastically quickly, should investors count on Apple to deliver sustainable dividend   growth?Apple's Business AnalysisApple is a global technology company with a rich history of   product innovation. In fiscal year 2015, they generated sales of   roughly $234 billion dollars. To put some context around this   colossal sales number, it islarger than the GDP of many countries.In general, the technology industry isa difficult industry to invest in for dividend   investorsdue to the speed at which trends can influence competitive   positions. The same factors that have allowed Apple to be   extremely successful could just as easily go against the company   if a competitor were to come out with a far superior product or   if a new innovation were to displace the iPhone entirely.Besides paying attention to all the usualimportant financial ratios, dividend investors need to pay attention to the sustainability   of the current margin structure, projected key product growth   rates, and Apple's capital allocation.10 Stocks to Take Profits On NOWApple operates the business through key product lines   including the iPhone (66% of sales), iPad (10%), Mac (11% ),   Services (8.5%), and Other Products (4.5%). Apple generates   enviable economics with returns on invested capital significantly   above its cost of capital driven by 30%+ operating margins.Source: Simply Safe DividendsMargins have significantly increased from around 12% in the   pre-iPhone years close to a decade ago. In fiscal year 2006,   Apple's main sources of revenue came from the Mac and iPad.   Clearly the economics of the business have changed with the   introduction of the iPhone.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSomereportsput the gross margins on the iPhone 6 at nearly 70%. This is a   huge margin and obviously helped drive up the company-wide   margins well into the 30% range.Furthermore, Apple's margin is well in excess of estimated   Android phone manufacturer (HTC,Sony Corp (ADR)(SNE),LG,Samsung Electronic(SSNLF), etc.margins of flat to 10%.The only reason Apple can generate such a superior economic   profile relative to peers has to be  due to brand power,   capturing the full economics of the phone (software and   hardware), better terms from suppliers, or a superior product. In   fact, it is likely that they benefit from all of these   factors. Given the current business mix and way the business   has evolved over the past decade, the sustainability of iPhone   margins are the key to maintaining the robust operating   profile.Clearly this could change if Apple develops a breakthrough new   product or service. After all, few predicted back in the   early-to-mid-2000s that smartphone adoption would take off like   it did and that Apple would be the one to capture the majority of   the value from the market.Assuming that the business mix remains the same, the key to   the sustainability of the current operating profile and future   dividend increases is maintaining the iPhone economics.Acurrent iPhone 6s costs $100 more(roughly 15% higher price point) than a Galaxy S7 despite the   Samsung phones having a better display and camera, more storage,   and a host of other features.If people were simply interested in the specification and   features, then purchasing the iPhone at a higher price point does   not make sense. Instead people buy based on brand and user   experience. After all, if the average person is unable to   seamlessly navigate all the features, then the features don't add   any value.Also, the way most iPhones are purchased enables very   attractive pricing. In 2015,76% of US shoppersbought phones through their carrier. This means that there wasn't   the upfront $600+ sticker shock of purchasing the phone. Instead,   the phone cost is built into the monthly cell phone bill. This is   akin to financing a car rather than paying cash up front.The most recent data point indicates that the pricing dynamic   in the market is still healthy. Apple recently released their new   iPhone 7 family, and some versions are at a higher price   point.While growth investors will be paying attention to the latest   news on iPhone shipments and product cycles, the number one   concern for dividend investors needs to be on the current margin   structure. For now it appears that the iPhone economics appear   intact.Dividend Safety Analysis: AppleWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of   fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of   a dividend. Apple's dividend and fundamental data charts can all   be seen byclicking here.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the   current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as   current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels,   free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and   more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative   dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least   60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends   had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of   their dividend reduction announcements.We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety   Scores are calculated, what their track record has been, and how   to use them for your portfoliohere.Apple's Dividend Safety Score is 95, which indicates that the   dividend is not only much safer than the average dividend-paying   stock in the market, but actually one of the safest   overall. The strong safety score is driven by relatively low   payout ratios, a healthy balance sheet, strong business   economics, and low industry cyclicality.Since initiating the dividend in 2012, Apple's free cash flow   and EPSpayout ratioshave stayed below 30%. For 2016, they are expected to generate   EPS of $8.28 and pay dividends of $2.23 per share. This implies a   very comfortable payout ratio of 27% for 2016.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsApple's balance sheet is one of the healthiest in corporate   America. As of the end of the second quarter 2016, they have over   $18 billion in cash and another $213 billion in short and   long-term marketable securities.These marketable securities are mostly composed of U.S.   treasuries, corporate debt, and mortgage and asset-backed   securities. Offsetting this cash and marketable securities   is $12.5 billion in commercial paper and a little over $72   billion in current and long-term debt.Overall, Apple has over $145 billion in net cash and   marketable securities on the balance sheet.To put some context behind just how much money sits on Apple's   balance sheetPepsiCo, Inc.(PEP),International Business Machines Corp.(IBM),Walt Disney Co(DIS),Medtronic PLC(MDT),Mastercard Inc(MA), and a whole host of other blue chip, multi-national businesses   have a market cap that is less than just the net cash and   marketable securities on Apple's balance sheet.On an annual basis, Apple pays about $12.2 billion in   dividends. This means that Apple can cover the current annual   dividend payments for around 12 years with just the net cash and   marketable securities on hand.While the majority of the cash and marketable securities is   located outside the U.S. and is not easily available for a tax   efficient payout, Apple can issue debt in the US to finance   capital returns to shareholders. We do not expect this dynamic to   change anytime soon.Recently, the European Commission announced that Ireland must   recover up to $14.6 billion dollars in taxes from Apple. If Apple   would have to pay this tomorrow, it would not be an issue for the   company given the net cash position. However, we believe the more   likely scenario is that the ruling gets tied up in court for   years.As detailed in the Business Analysis section above, Apple   generates robust economics that leads to significant free cash   flow.We expect these economics to be persistent as long as Apple is   able to maintain the pricing power and manufacturing   relationships for the iPhone. We will be closely monitoring the   situation, but dividend investors should rest easy knowing that   the Apple brand has been strong for many decades.The last piece that leads to the phenomenal Dividend Safety   Score is the historical stability of Apple's end markets.Since the iPhone (and smart phones in general) were just   gaining mainstream penetration during the financial crisis, that   time period is not a good indicator of how the business will   perform during the next recession.During the next recession, individuals will likely defer   upgrades, trade down to a cheaper phone, and/or purchase used   iPhones. This could significantly impact sales for a year or two,   but Apple's strong brand and feature additions should eventually   stimulate sales to inflect back upwards.Overall, we see very little risk to Apple's dividend over next   few years. The factors that could lead to a dividend cut or   suspension appear to be more tail risk events such as significant   brand damage and/or technological disruption. Even so,   Apple's hoard of cash provides it with plenty of flexibility to   continue paying dividends and make the right investments or   acquisitions to stay relevant.Dividend Growth AnalysisOur Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the   dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same   fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on   growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout   ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and   25 or lower is considered weak.Here's how Apple fares in this critical measure…Apple's Dividend Growth Score is 89, which indicates excellent   future growth potential. Since starting to pay a dividend in   mid-2012, Apple has grown it at around 10% per year on a   full-year basis.Within reason, Apple could probably grow their dividend as   fast as they want. The combination of a relatively low payout   ratio, extraordinarily strong balance sheet, and end markets that   should continue to grow can fuel dividend growth for many to   come.Source: Simply Safe DividendsIn reality, Apple is likely to keep up the roughly 10% per   year growth rate for some time. The company still views itself as   a growth company and is willing to invest billions and billions   of dollars into high risk, but high reward business ventures in   huge addressable markets (autonomous driving cars, payments,   etc).While iPhone sales will be a bit choppy year to year depending   on customer upgrades and new product introductions, we expect   iPhone growth to continue to be strong over the course of the   next five years.AAPL Stock ValuationApple currently trades just below 13x 2016 earning estimates.   These are relatively low expectations for a company that has an   entrenched competitive participation and participates in large   growing markets. Why are expectations so low?We believe that expectations are low because there are few   precedents for companies the size of Apple, fears over the iPhone   product cycle, and investors unsure of what will lead the company   in the next stage of growth.Very few companies in the course of history have reached the   size of Apple.Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) briefly hit a $600 billion plus equity valuation at the height   of the dot-com boom, and investors who purchased at the peak are   still down on their investment from late 1999.This brings in the all-important issue of the difficulty of   growth when you at nearly $234 billion in sales. For Apple   to grow sales by 10% from 2015 levels which represents a near   term peak, they would need to increase sales by over $23 billion   dollars.Assuming all the growth came from iPhones at an average price   point of $700, they would need to sell roughly an incremental 32   million phones. This illustrates the difficulty of growing at   this size and shows why Apple is looking at other huge markets   (autonomous cars, payments, etc).All in all, investors in Apple have potential to earn a double   digit annual rate of return from these levels.Sources of upside to this expected rate are from how Apple   allocates its capital. If they are able to successfully penetrate   other huge markets and generate favorable economics, another   growth leg will ensue.The main source of downside to this expected rate of return is   a breakdown in the economics of the iPhone.Apple Conclusion: A Safe Dividend Stock With Double-Digit   Future GrowthApple is going through a difficult stretch currently with a   lull in iPhone sales this year and investors pondering the next   growth driver for a company that generated fiscal year 2015 sales   of nearly $234 billion. However, none of these factors will lead   to adividend cutin the near term.Pandora Media Inc (P) Is Rockin', But Don't       Come A-Knockin'!Conversely, this represents an opportunity for investors to   own a high quality business that has incredible brand strength   and customer intimacy at a reasonable valuation of roughly 13x   earnings.The dividend appears to be extremely safe and will continue to   grow at a low double digit rate for the foreseeable future. While   APPL's current dividend yield of 2.2% isn't enough forretirement living, its growth is attractive for longer-term investors.Overall, Apple could be poised to deliver double digit returns   and seems to share many characteristics with the stocks in   ourTop 20 Dividend Stock Portfolio.The postApple (AAPL): Reviewing One of Warren Buffett's   New Dividend Stocksappeared first onSimply Safe Dividends.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy for SeptemberThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks in the WorldThe postApple Inc.: One of Warren Buffett's New Dividend   Stocks (AAPL)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons Why My Millennial Friends Are Not Buying the iPhone 7;9/13/2016;"TheiPhone 7 is here, but competition is steeper than ever for AppleAAPL.  SamsungSSNLFand other cell phone manufacturers are nipping at the heels of the Cupertino giant, and investors havemultiple reasons for why Apple may run into some obstacleswith regards to holding onto its large market share in the smartphone industry.Improved battery life, water resistance, more memory, and a better camera make the iPhone 7 a notable upgrade from the iPhone 6s.  However, there are reasons for why many of my iPhone-wielding friends (who are in their 20s) will be opting out of upgrading to the iPhone 7.No Headphone JackMost people have heard about this by now, but I'll say it anyways.  TheiPhone 7 does not have the standard 3.5mm audio jackthat you've been accustomed to seeing on pretty much every smartphone over the last decade.  The device does ship with wireless headphones called AirPods, and they also come with an adaptor, but it has a rectangular Lightning connector.The problem that arises with this is that users will not be able to charge their phones while listening to music (or making calls) with wired headphones that have a Lightning connector.   You could get a dongle that lets you use wired headphones while charging, but that's another $40 dollars which you'd have to shell out.Furthermore, most headphones use 3.5mm jacks to connect, and this is still a very popular way of listening to music since you get better sound quality without having to worry about the battery life of your headphones.  While Bluetooth technology can help in dodging problems associated with a jack-less iPhone 7, sound quality is often sacrificed.  This is a big deal for some of my millennial peers, and it is a viable reason for why they won't be upgrading toApple's latestflagship device.Looks like the iPhone 6Now, the iPhone 7 is a great phone across most specs and it is also a clear upgrade from the iPhone 6.  We've established this, and while the internals are different, Apple failed to give the exterior a complete makeover.  In fact, the iPhone 7's height, width, and depth are exactly the same as the iPhone 6s (5.44 by 2.64 by 0.28 inches).  The Lightning connector is in the same place, but the phone now sports a home button that's no longer physical.Apple made a bold choice by going with a design that is very similar to its last smartphone, but users stand to feel disappointed by the lack of design change.  In Naperville, a town close to where I live, everyone seems to have an iPhone.  I was hanging out with a group of my friends in Naperville over the weekend and I asked them if they were excited about upgrading to the iPhone 7.Not surprisingly, most of them were put off by the fact that the phone doesn't look like much of a sequel to the iPhone 6 on the surface.  They are hardcore Apple fans, but they worry about the phone not feeling or looking like much of an upgrade when they hold it.  Like my friends, I also appreciate the aesthetic physical qualities in any new phone or device I buy.  I also admit that when I upgrade, I do take pride in receiving something that looks like a distinctly unique product.Waiting for the iPhone 8While the iPhone 7 boasts new hardware upgrades compared to its predecessor, the device seems like more of an incremental upgrade as opposed to being a big step forward for Apple.  Some speculate that the iPhone 7's similar design to the iPhone 6 shows that Apple is planning on making bigger changes for its next phone.This could give people reason to wait longer, and this is troubling since there is an ongoing trend of smartphone users waiting longer before replacing their phones.  Apple has previously done well in getting its users to upgrade their phones to the next version available, but it may now run into a problem that many other cell phone manufacturers face.Yesterday, my friend said that she is waiting for the iPhone 8 because her iPhone 6 is already great.  The specs of the iPhone 7 didn't convince her that an upgrade was worth it, but she heard that the iPhone 8 would boast a large screen that takes up the entire front of the phone.  I have also heard this rumor and I think that this would definitely be an innovative feature since it hasn't been tried yet2017 will be the 10thanniversary of the iPhone, and many speculate that Apple will really kick things up a notch when it reveals its next phone.  Although the timeline dictates that this would be the time where Apple releases the ""s"" version of its phone, it may skip that version altogether, similar to how Samsung jumped right from the Galaxy Note 5 to theGalaxy Note 7.Bottom LineI am not saying that millennials won't buy the iPhone 7.  I am simply relaying my experiences to show the thought process behind why some younger people will choose to opt out of upgrading their iPhone 6 to Apple's latest phone.From its simplicity to its exclusivity, there are many things that millennials appreciate about the iPhone and Apple's brand.  Unfortunately, there are a few let-downs which could negatively impact how Apple's latest phone resonates with younger consumers.

1 Way the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Beats the Samsung Galaxy Note7;9/13/2016;"Image source: Samsung.WhenApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced the iPhone 7 Plus, the company said it   made the display significantly brighter and, for good measure,   added support for wide color. However, the resolution -- the   number of pixels in the display -- remained unchanged from both   the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 6s Plus.makeArticleAd();This has led some industry followers and consumers to conclude   that the newest plus-size iPhone falls behind theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note7 by this metric. Indeed, the   display on the Galaxy Note7 measures 5.7 inches along the   diagonal, at a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels.In contrast, the iPhone 7 Plus features a display resolution   of ""only"" 1,920 by 1,080 pixels on a 5.5-inch screen. Basic math   will tell you that the Galaxy Note7 will feature higher pixel   density and therefore, has a sharper display than the competing   iPhone.In this case, however, basic math is highly misleading.The dirty secret of the Note7 displayOn the iPhone 7 Plus display, each pixel is made up of three   sub-pixels: red, blue, and green. That means there are   1,920-by-1,080 each of red, green, and blue sub-pixels. Pretty   straightforward, right?On the Galaxy Note7 display, it doesn't quite work like that.   According toOLED-info, recent Samsung displays use a technology known as PenTile. The   site explains that the sub-pixel arrangement on Samsung displays   is known as a ""Diamond Pixel"". In a nutshell, this Diamond   Pixel arrangement means that instead of having each pixel consist   of a red, green, and blue sub-pixel, it is instead made up oftwogreen sub-pixels, one red sub-pixel, and one blue sub-pixel.As a result, while the Note7 display packs more green   sub-pixels in a given area than the display on the iPhone 7 Plus,   the Apple offering packs more blue and red sub-pixels per inch   than the Note7. DisplayMate calculates that there are 518 green   sub-pixels per inch on the Note7 display, while there are 401   sub-pixels per inch on the iPhone 7 Plus. But it places 401 each   for blue and red on the iPhone, against 366 each on the   Note7.So in a very real sense, the iPhone 7 Plus display is actually   ahead of the Note7 when it comes to red/blue sub-pixel   density.The display comparison between the two phones isn't so clear   cutThere are certainly areas where the Note7 display will   outperform its peer. For example, the Note7 display is an AMOLED,   while the iPhone 7 Plus display is an LCD. That means the   contrast ratio of the Note7 display will be much   superior. The Note7 also curves on the sides, while it is   unlikely that a mobile LCD would be able to replicate that   design.However, Apple claims that the display on the iPhone 7 Plus   can achieve 625 nits of brightness. AnandTech measured the   maximum brightness of the Note7 at just 359 nits, already well   below the 582 nits measured for the iPhone 6s Plus in that same   article.Given that the iPhone 6s Plus is advertised at a maximum   brightness of 500 nits, well below what AnandTech measured, I   wouldn't be surprised to see the display on the iPhone 7 Plus far   exceed what Apple officially advertises.The point, though, is that it doesn't make sense to criticize   the iPhone display simply because it doesn't measure up to   another flagship device based on some random specification,   especially one as misleading as pixel density.Apple's uphill challengeAt the end of the day, Apple has a difficult marketing hurdle   to overcome with respect to the Galaxy Note7 and other   smartphones that use high-resolution AMOLED displays with a   diamond sub-pixel structure. Consumers typically don't read up on   these details and instead rely on the numbers included in   marketing materials or in reviews.Fortunately, although Apple is currently at a   resolution/pixels per inch marketing disadvantage, my expectation   is that people who actually look at these smartphones in person   (at a retail store, for example) will find them quite   comparable.The Note7 wild cardSamsung is also suffering from a troubling turn of events that   could very well offset any perceived display advantages it   offered with the Note7 -- exploding batteries.Indeed, the company recently announced amassive recallof its Note7 phones due to this issue. Apparently, Note7   batteries have actually blown up, and the situation has   snowballed to the point that the United States Consumer Product   Safety Commission is telling Note7 owners to ""power them down and   stop charging or using the device"".Even if the Note7 sports a better display (or is simply   perceived to offer one), the iPhone 7 Plus is likely to enjoy a   robust introduction and launch, boosting Apple's share of the   large-screen smartphone market at Samsung's expense. Samsung will   be stuck dealing with the fallout of its recall until the company   launches its next generation flagship devices next year.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Some Bad News for Apple Inc.'s iPhone 7 Plus;9/13/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus   smartphones during its Sept. 7 launch event. The new phones, as   I've written about previously, appear to bequite strongofferings, with substantial improvements made across the   board.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, along with a flurry of feature improvements,   Apple also rolled out two new finishes -- an elegant-looking   black model and a glossy jet black. It would seem, however, that   Apple may have substantially underestimated the demand it would   enjoy for the jet-black variants of its new iPhones.Let's take a closer look at what's going on and what the   implications could be for Apple's business.Those long ship times ...According to Apple's website, orders placed for the iPhone 7   Plus in jet black -- whether they're for the 128 gigabyte model   or the 256 -- won't even ship to customers until sometime in   November:Image source: Apple.com.Furthermore, it didn't even take long for those ship times to   get pushed out to November. MacRumors reported at 3:32 a.m. EDT,   just 32 minutes after Apple began taking pre-orders, that those   ship times slipped to November.The good news and the bad newsThe obvious positive here is that there is very clear demand   for the jet-black iPhone 7 Plus models -- two of the most   expensive iPhones that the iDevice maker currently offers for   sale. The phone's features and technologies are compelling, but   it's also clear that the visual appearance and aesthetic of the   jet-black iPhone 7 Plus is also appealing to consumers.Moreover, it would seem that supply is tighter for the   jet-black iPhone 7 Plus than it is for the jet-black iPhone 7;   Apple's site says that orders placed for the latter today will   ship in ""3-4 weeks"" -- considerably better than ""November.""The bad news, though, is that Apple seems to have grossly   underestimated the demand it would see for this particular   variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. Barring that, Apple simply can't   make enough of these phones to meet demand in a timely fashion,   perhaps because the device is simply more difficult to   manufacture than the other versions.In the best cases for Apple, potential jet-black iPhone 7 Plus   buyers will either place their orders and choose to wait the   additional two months for the device or simply choose a more   readily available iPhone 7 Plus variant.In a not-so-good case for Apple, frustrated potential buyers   could opt to buy smartphones from a competitor. That could   account for a reasonable amount of the popularity thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is apparently enjoying.Not the end of the world, but a suboptimal situationAt the end of the day, being supply constrained on a   particular iPhone 7 Plus model is hardly cause to proclaim doom   and gloom for the iDevice maker. However, given that Apple really   needs to pull out all the stops to try to drive iPhone growth   during this product cycle -- and the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus   might be good enough to do just that -- supply constraints are   simply less than ideal.Apple's job now will be to scale up production of the   jet-black iPhones to try to bring supply in line with demand as   quickly as possible.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Samsung May Be De-Emphasizing Chips in Favor of Displays;9/13/2016;"Image source: Samsung.According to areportfrom Digitimes, consumer-electronics giantSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is ""looking to invest heavily in its OLED   business."" This heavy investment, the report says, ""will squeeze   [capital expenditures] on its other operations, particularly the   foundry segment.""makeArticleAd();For those unfamiliar, OLED is a type of display technology   used in smartphones and other consumer-electronics devices. And   ""foundry,"" in this case, refers to Samsung's contract chip   manufacturing work for chip design companies that don't own and   operate their own manufacturing plants.Digitimes' industry sources reportedly say that Samsung's   emphasis on building out its OLED display business ""could put   Samsung at a disadvantage when competing against [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) ] in advanced technologies.""In fact, Digitimes' sources even say that ""there is a chance   of Qualcomm moving back to TSMC for 10 [nanometer]."" Those same   sources, the report claims, had ""previously suggested TSMC would   win back its Qualcomm business in 7 [nanometers].""Does this report make sense? If so, what implications could it   have on Samsung and, potentially, the semiconductor landscape as   a whole? Let's take a closer look.Squaring things up with business realitiesAlthough Samsung has made quite a lot of noise around its   contract chip manufacturing business, it doesn't appear to be   particularly successful. For a while, Samsung had a large anchor   customer in the form ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and its A-series processors. Up until the A8,   Samsung was Apple's sole manufacturing partners for these   chips.However, Samsung was completely shut out of the A8, with TSMC   winning all of those orders. Samsung was back in the loop with   Apple's A9, and it even reportedly got the majority of the chip   orders for that generation, but it's believed that Apple's   recently announced A10 Fusion chip is, once again, a TSMC   exclusive.According to Economic Daily News, TSMC is going to be the   exclusive supplier of the A11 chip on its upcoming 10-nanometer   manufacturing technology -- something that jibes with TSMC's ownmarket share expectationsduring the 10-nanometer generation.From a business perspective, Samsung's decision to   de-emphasize leading-edge chip manufacturing almost seems like a   no-brainer. If Apple is gone and if Qualcomm was already planning   to ditch Samsung for TSMC at the 7-nanometer generation anyway,   then what incentives does Samsung have to continue to make the   significant capital expenditure and research-and-development   investments required to stay competitive here?In contrast, if a broad shift to OLED displays in smartphones   and other applications is imminent -- Apple is expected to adopt   OLEDs for its 2017 iPhones, for example -- and if Samsung is a   leading manufacturer of such displays, then it might make a lot   of sense to invest in capacity and technology to capitalize on   this demand and try to maintain a strong competitive   positioning.The implications for the semiconductor industry at largeIf Samsung were to effectively ""drop out"" as a contract chip   manufacturer, then this would probably prove to be a near- to   medium-term positive for TSMC. With very little competition in   leading-edge technologies, TSMC gains pricing power, which could   help it to maintain or even grow its gross profit margin, which   came in at an impressive 51.5% last quarter and is expected to be   in the range of 50% to 52% in the current quarter.Conversely, this would be a negative for companies that rely   on contract chip manufacturers to build designs on cutting-edge   chip manufacturing technologies; TSMC's gaining pricing power   could mean increased costs for these companies, ultimately   leading to lower gross profit margin for them.This could also open up an opportunity for microprocessor   giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) to try to step in and potentially fill the void   that Samsung might leave behind. However, Intel doesn't have a   track record as a contract chip manufacturer, so it might be a   while before it could be a realistic alternative to TSMC in this   market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Pre-Orders FOUR Times Greater Than iPhone 6;9/13/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExpectations for the iPhone 7 launch have been modest, to put it mildly. EvenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced it is breaking with tradition andwill not release first-weekend sales numbersfor the new iPhone. However,T-Mobile(TMUS) CEO John Legere is offering hope toApple stockinvestors, claiming iPhone 7 launch numbers are four times greater than the iPhone 6.Source: T-MobileConsideringhow well T-Mobile did in 2014 with that iPhone 6 launch, Legere's comment offers the intriguing possibility that Apple might just have an unexpected hit on its hands.makeArticleAd();T-Mobile's Legere Takes to PeriscopeNever one to shy away from making his views known, Legere used Periscope last night to talk about the new iPhone 7.During the session, he called iPhone 7 sales phenomenal, declaring:""The first four days of the iPhone 7 launch are by far the biggest ever for T-Mobile. It's four times bigger than the iPhone 6 for us, at this stage.""He also revealed that Matte Black has been the most popular color choice with T-Mobile customers, while admitting that he chose the Jet Black iPhone 7 for himself - despite Apple's warnings about a finish that is more easily scratched.Why the iPhone 7 May Exceed ExpectationsGoing into (and immediately after) theSeptember iPhone 7 event, there was considerable concern that the iPhone 7 would turn out to be a dud.10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun GoogleWith AAPL switching to a three-year design cycle, the new iPhone looked almost identical to the previous two generations. There were tantalizing rumors about a massive upgrade next year for the iPhone's 10th anniversary, including a curved AMOLED display. Then there was the controversial decision to ax the headphone jack.With Apple pre-announcing it would not be releasing launch numbers, it seemed like the company was also concerned the iPhone 7 would bomb.So why would T-Mobile be seeing record pre-sales?First, the iPhone 7 Plus and its dual camera system   haveproduced some phenomenal photos. Apple made sure to get the new iPhones into the hands of   professional photographers, who have been posting photos snapped   at pro sports events.Second, the new A10 Fusion CPU in the iPhone 7 has beenperforming exceedingly well in testing. It delivers a serious performance upgrade, along with better   battery life. Users will definitely see a difference.Third, the water resistance introduced in the new iPhone is   something that AAPL fans have been waiting a long time for. The   idea of being able to use their phone in the rain instead of   having to stuff it in an expensive and bulky waterproof case has   a lot of appeal.And finally,Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) handed AAPL a gift with therecall of exploding Galaxy Note 7s. The public relations nightmare for Samsung suddenly makes   Apple's more conservative approach to smartphone design look a   lot more appealing.It's Early for Apple Optimism, But …T-Mobile claims aside, it's early yet. And T-Mobile itself has offered incentives to upgrade that could be skewing sales. As pointed out byDigital Trends, the carrier is offering a trade-in deal on older iPhones that couldnet an iPhone 7 for free on a 24-month contract.Still, this is positive news. It could just be that after all the fuss about a meaningless release, Apple under-promised and over-delivered with the iPhone 7. That combined with the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco helping to cancel out the negative PR over ditching the headphone jack could result in the iPhone 7 turning into an unexpected win for AAPL.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlacePandora Stock Is Rockin', But Don't Come     A-Knockin'Apple Inc.

A Triple Win for This Apple Inc. Supplier;9/13/2016;"Image source: Apple.At this point, it's practically common knowledge thatTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) is the sole manufacturer ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) A10 Fusion chip inside the recently announced   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones.makeArticleAd();Today, I'd like to highlight how this is not just a win for   the Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturer, but a triple   win.Sole sourcing should help TSMC quite a bitLast year, Apple split the manufacturing of its A9 chip   between TSMC and its longtime rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . In fact, not only did TSMC wind up sharing   the A9 with Samsung -- after TSMC had won the entirety of the   prior-generation A8 orders -- but it was also widely reported   that it wound up with a minority allocation of the orders.Tough break, eh?By going from a minority supplier of the A9 to the sole   provider of the A10, TSMC stands to enjoy a nice year-over-year   boost in revenue during this iPhone product cycle, though it will   be offset somewhat by the fact that Apple's mid-tier iPhones will   go from being TSMC-exclusive to split between TSMC and   Samsung.A larger chip size should drive even more wafer salesChips are essentially ""printed"" onto silicon wafers of a fixed   diameter -- in the case of the A10 and other leading-edge chips,   that diameter is 300 millimeters or just under 12 inches. The   individual chips -- referred to as dies -- are then cut out of   those wafers and then packaged for use.Last year's A9 measured in at 104.5 square millimeters in   TSMC's 16-nanometer manufacturing technology, according to a   measurement from Chipworks.In a recent column, I estimated that the A10 measures in at   147 square millimeters -- substantially larger than the A9 chip   it replaces. The fact that the A10 is so much larger means that,   for a given unit volume, Apple will require more wafers to meet   that demand. Since TSMC sells wafers, the combination of the   larger chip size and the sole sourcing arrangement means that the   chipmaker is likely to generate alotmore revenue from this iPhone cycle than the prior-generation   one.A packaging win, tooIt isbelievedthat in addition to handling the wafer fabrication duties,   several reports suggest that the chipmaker is also providing   chip-packaging services to Apple with its new Integrated Wafer   Level Wan-Out, or InFO packaging technology.The amount of incremental dollar content from this win is   likely to be far less than winning all of the chip orders or the   significant chip die size increase in going from the A9 to the   A10, but it's additional revenue and profit dollars in TSMC's   coffers. In my book, anyway, that's a ""win.""TSMC has Apple, but the struggle continuesRight now, TSMC is arguably Apple's most important chip   partner. TSMC has clearly done a good job developing leadership   technologies and providing the right level of service that Apple   requires. The chipmaker's job now will be to try to fend off   Samsung and, if you believethe rumors,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) for future A-series processor business.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

HP Inc. Aims to Disrupt and Reinvent Copier Industry With Acquisition of Samsung's Printer Business;9/12/2016;"Personal computer and printer companyHP(NYSE: HPQ) announced a surprising move on Monday to acquireSamsung Electronics'(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) printer business in a deal valued at $1.05   billion. HP stock is trading 1.9% higher at the time of this   writing as investors digest the implications of the deal.Samsung printer. Image source: Samsung.makeArticleAd();HP's ambitions with the acquisition of Samsung's printer   business are grand. With Samsung's printer technologies under its   belt, the company wants to ""disrupt and reinvent the $55 billion   copier industry, a segment that hasn't innovated in decades,"" HP   said in a press release on Monday.But such disruption is easier said than done. While the   acquisition may better position HP to accelerate its plans to   make inroads on the copier segment, the move also comes with   meaningful risk.Here's what investors need to know.Why Samsung's printer business?HP's choice to acquire Samsung's printer segment was based on   the belief that the company's A3 MFPs, or multifunction printers,   are superior technology to copiers and can replace them.HP explained the rationale in its press release:Copiers are outdated, complicated machines with dozens of     replaceable parts requiring inefficient service and maintenance     agreements. Customers are frequently frustrated with the number     of visits needed to keep copier machines functioning. Today, HP     is investing to disrupt this category by replacing copiers with     superior multifunction printer (MFP) technology.Samsung has built a formidable portfolio of A3 MFPs that     deliver the performance of copiers with the power, simplicity,     reliability and ease-of-use of printers and with as few as     seven replaceable parts. Integrating the Samsung printer     business' products, including their mobile-first and     cloud-first user experience, with HP's next-generation PageWide     technologies will create a breakthrough portfolio of printing     solutions with the industry's best device, document, and data     security.As part of the deal, Samsung agreed to invest $100 million to   $300 million in HP through open-market purchases after closing,   demonstrating its confidence in the direction HP is taking its   business.Furthermore, the deal, which is expected to close in about 12   months, entails HP's acquisition of Samsung's portfolio of more   than 6,500 printing patents.RisksIn theory, this acquisition sounds great. As HP explained in   its press release, it creates ""new avenues for growth"" for the   company as industry sales models ""shift from transactional to   contractual."" But it's impossible to ignore the heated   competition in the copier space and headwinds in the printer   space in general.By moving into the A3 copier segment with the Samsung deal, HP   will be up against established rivals, such asXerox(NYSE: XRX) ,Canon, andRicoh. These players are unlikely to let HP come in and ""disrupt"" the   industry as easily as HP makes it sound.Furthermore, the printer segment is questionable overall as   demand declines for printers and supplies. For instance, in HP's   most recent quarter, printing revenue declined 14% year over year   and 5% sequentially. And its higher-margin supplies subsegment,   which accounts for 64% of its printing revenue, saw revenue   decline 18% year over year and 8% sequentially. And Xerox's   declining revenue in its document technology business, which is   made up of sales of printer and copier products and supplies, and   the associated maintenance and financing of these products,   doesn't help justify a case for growth opportunities in the A3   copier segment. Xerox's document technology business reported   revenue of $1.8 billion in the company's most recent quarter,   down 7% year over year.Before the deal's expected closing, in 12 months, HP investors   should carefully consider whether a move into the highly   competitive A3 copier space really makes sense.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Fitbit Inc: Why the Commoditization Risk Is Overblown (FIT);9/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt would be easier to pick a stock that could double its price   in one year than to read aboutFitbit Inc(FIT) stock without reading - for the umpteenth time - how it is   performing woefully this year.Indeed, Fitbit stock is down by about 50% so far this year on   back of worries regarding the future of the company. Put simply,   fears lurk around the investment sphere that Fitbit's products   can beeasily commoditized.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Its shrinking lead in the wearables market has not been   helping to allay such fears. IDC estimated that FIT had about 25%   of the wearables market as of the end of the first quarter. FIT   had 33% of the wearables market as of end of 2015 first   quarter.All of these have driven short interest in FIT stock up by   roughly 82% year-to-date.EvenGoPro Inc(GPRO), whose situation helped fuel fears about market   commoditization, have never seen such widespread bearish   sentiment.However, here's why investors shouldn't be so worried.Risk of Losing Leading Market Share Is OverblownAs referenced above, fears of market commoditization has   contributed a great deal to the crippled condition of Fitbit   stock. Apart from commoditization, though, the entrance ofAppleInc.(AAPL) into the wearables market through the Apple Watch also added to   the worries, as investors fear that Apple is big enough to   outmuscle Fitbit stock in no time. However, the bears are missing   some advantages that FIT stock has going for it.5 Stocks to Buy for SeptemberFirst, even though the wearables market is sincerely prone to   commoditization, Fitbit's focus on health makes a whole lot of   difference. For instance, in the corporate world, where Fitbit   stock is trying to help companies up their employees' health   through its corporate wellness program, it is in unlikely that   corporate bodies would think, ""There are cheaper options out   there, why not go for those?"" And by cheaper options, I mean   similar wearables produced by solopreneurs who just want to have   a slice of the market.Corporate bodies would rather stick with a name they know and   can hold responsible or trust for quick help especially since   health is involved, according toStarling Capital. Moreover, the bears are missing that point that the first-mover   advantage exists for any company that offers products and   services tied to healthcare.To make things more practical, consider the smartphone mobile   market. This market has been commoditized. One just needs to look   at the developing world, where smartphonescostless than $100 on the average, to understand. But that didn't not   make leaders like Apple andSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) less relevant. That's because they simply offer more than just   selling phone.In the same vein, market commoditization won't drive Fitbit   into oblivion overnight because, like Apple and Samsung, it just   doesn't make wearables. It has bundled services that gives it   more value proposition than the average commoditizer. Moreover,   it has more cash and investor support to withstand a market   commoditization.Why Don't You Just Buy Facebook Stock,       Dammit? (FB)So while, market commoditization would obviously limit the   extent to which Fitbit can penetrate the market, it is still well   positioned to stay on top. In addition, investors have to bear in   mind that Fitbit's fitness wearables market is still very much in   a nascent stage. As the market grows, Fitbit will surely get   bigger.The Bottom Line: FIT is a BargainWith Fitbit in a good position to grow its revenue by 35% this   year, following a 100%-plus increase in 2015, investors just have   to see the current depression in Fitbit stock as a buying   opportunity. Moreover, its valuation looks good, with its   one-year forward PE ratio standing at 10.40, which is better than   bigger competitor, Apple's, one-year forward PE of 11.96.   Contrary to what the bears wants to have us believe, Fitbit stockreeks of value.The postFitbit: Why The Risk Of Market Commoditization Is   Overblownappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Apple's Pacing Out Its Smartwatch Updates -- And That's a Good Thing;9/12/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced its new smartwatch last week, after a   year and a half without a hardware upgrade. Typically, Apple and   other companies update new mobile and wearable products every   year, but Apple hasn't been in any hurry. The company's managed   to outpace sales ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)  smartwatches by more than 1 million in   the second quarter of this year and is nipping at the heels of   the current wearable tech leader,Fitbit(NYSE: FIT) .What Apple upgradedTopping the list of upgrades in the newly released Apple Watch   Series 2 was a GPS sensor. It wasn't a surprising update to the   device, but it's a much-needed one. One of the most common   complaints about the current Apple Watch was its lack of   independence from the iPhone. With its own GPS sensor, runners   will now be able to track their runs more easily with their   watch.makeArticleAd();That's a small step, of course, but this is Apple. The company   enjoys entering new markets with flashy devices, grabbing lots of   market share right out of the gate, and then slowly improving its   devices over the subsequent years.After the GPS, the other major upgrade is that the popular   smartwatch is now waterproof up to 50 meters. That's a big step   up from the previous versions' splash proof description. Videos   of swimmers completely submerging their Apple Watches abounded in   the presentation, along with a presentation on how Apple   engineers repositioned the speaker on the Series 2 to push water   out after it's been dunked in water.And lastly, Apple updated some of the internals, including a   brighter display, an improved graphics processor, and a new   dual-core S2 processor that's 50% faster than the previous   generation. Apple's also upgrading the processor in the first   generation Apple Watch.Why these incremental upgrades matterNone of these upgrades are revolutionary, and almost all of   them were already anticipated. But here's why simple,   incremental upgrades will be enough for the company's smartwatch:   Apple is already the No. 1 smartwatch vendor in the world and (as   it humbly pointed out in its presentation) it's also the No. 2   watch vendor worldwide.In short, Apple doesn't need major upgrades, gimmicks, or   anything else to move its smartwatches off the shelves.Samsung released its first Gear smartwatch more than three   years ago and has peppered the market with a handful of wearable   devices since then (it's already on the third version of its   smartwatch). And yet Samsung shipped 1 million fewer smartwatches   in Q2 2016 than Apple did.Image source: Apple.Apple still trails Fitbit in overall wearable shipment   numbers, but Apple's meteoric rise in the wearable space in such   short time means the company doesn't have much to worry   about.Fitbit has been making wearable tech devices for about seven   years and currently has nine wearable products on the market. The   company introduced its own smartwatch (the Blaze) recently and   continues to release new iterations of its popular fitness   trackers.While Fibit is the undisputed wearable tech king, the company   is fighting like mad to keep that position. The company's   operating expenses more than doubled in the most recent quarter,   year over year, as Fitbit poured more money into research and   development and marketing. And that's subsequently pushed down   gross margins from 46.8% last year to the current 41.8%.All of this indicates that Fitbit is running at a rapid pace   in order to stay ahead of Apple -- meanwhile the Apple Watch   maker is taking a leisurely stroll and still gaining more ground   in the wearable market.The bottom lineThe smartwatch market is still in its early stages and there's   plenty of time for Apple to build out its watch offerings even   further, and possibly add other wearable tech devices into the   mix.Apple will probably continue to bring slow, incremental   upgrades to the Apple Watch (a thinner design is the most likely,   along with an eventual LTE connection). But Apple is doing what   it always does -- pacing itself for the long distance race and   leaving its competitors to sweat it out in the short term.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Stocks to Watch Monday: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA), Perrigo Company plc Ordinary Shares (PRGO) and Samsung Electronic KRW5000 (SSNLF);9/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsOil prices fell on Friday as drillers added rigs as   producers ready themselves to buy cheaper crude prices. U.S.   markets are looking to recover Monday following a harrowing   Friday that sawall four major markets declinemore than 2% apiece.Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) actually had some good news to report … but Monday is shaping   up to be ugly for the broader market, and it likely will sweep it   up in the tide regardless.Samsung Electronic KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is sinking hard as its Note 7 calamity worsens. AndPerrigo Company plc Ordinary Shares(NYSE:PRGO) might be one of the only equities in the black today.makeArticleAd();Here's what investors and traders should be looking at on   Monday:Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)TSLA has announceda major shiftto its Autopilot feature that it expects will prevent   potential crashes in the future.In light of recent accidents that occurred in Tesla vehicles   with Autopilot mode engaged, the electric car maker has revised   the software by expanding radar technology in its sensors.10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun GoogleThe functionality previously consisted mostly of cameras and   3D-imaging with some radar technology to supplement the software.   With Version 8 of the feature, Tesla cars still will use   cameras, but radars will be the vehicles' prevalent form of   scanning its surroundings.The feature reads everything from fog, rain and snow to people   and other opaque objects in an accurate manner to avoid   accidents. Radar technology does have a weakness as metallic   objects look like mirrors, so a scan of something like a   soda can potentially could create a false alarm that activate's a   Tesla's brakes. Elon Musk & Co. believe they've figured this   out.The news, while certainly welcome amid an awful month that has   seen TSLA stock shed 13%, might not do much. Tesla shares were   off about 1% in Monday's premarket trade.Perrigo Company plc Ordinary Shares (PRGO)PRGO shares are up strongly in the face of a broader down   market amid a letter from Starboard Value LP, which now has a   4.6% stake in the drugmaker.Starboard is criticizing Perrigo's management has allowed   itself to become distracted thanks to a merger fight withMylan NV(NASDAQ:MYL), and performance has suffered as a result. The firm has urged   PRGO to hire advisers to explore the possibility of unloading   noncore assets such as multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri, as   well as other value-unlocking initiatives.Perrigo has lost roughly 40% of its value since the beginning   of the year - a period that has included a drastically reduced   full-year outlook and the departure of its CEO toValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX).PRGO shares are up more than 3% on Monday.Samsung Electronic KRW5000 (SSNLF)Samsung Electronic KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) shares continue to plummet amid the growing disaster that is   the Galaxy Note 7.

The phone ""suddenly   burst into flames,"" according to the report.Reports of such explosions have forced Samsung's hand. The   South Korean electronics giant has now told Note 7 owners that   they should stop using the phones.

PayPal’s Edge in the Mobile Wallet Space;9/9/2016;"There is no doubt thatPayPal(PYPL) is one of the fastest growing financial services companies in the world, nearly doubling its revenue from $5.6 billion in -…-- to $9.-4 billion in -…-5. During the same period,Visa(V), the world's largest payments processor, grew from $-….4- billion to $-'.88 billion in -…-5. Visa added $'.46 billion to their top line in three years while Paypal added $'.58 billion. Not bad for a company that is just -7 years old.PayPal's biggest strength has always been ease of use, and it is not really a surprise that their merchant base is the biggest revenue earner for the company, having reported -4.5 million merchant accounts at the end of the second quarter -…-6. Merchant services accounted for 8'% of the company's overall Total Payment Volume, or TPV.Warren Buffett Recent BuysmakeArticleAd();In recent years, however, the sudden move by tech majorsApple(AAPL),Samsung(SSNLF) andGoogle(GOOG) to enter the mobile wallet space has completely transformed the payments market. With consumers in their hands, they can easily force merchants to follow suit, reducing the need for PayPal as a third-party payment processor. PayPal recognized this threat and quickly got into bed with its erstwhile enemy Visa so both would be mutually insulated from the mobile wallet phenomenon, at least partially.The key arsenal in PayPal's armory in its fight with the big tech majors will be Venmo, the company's own mobile payment service that was brought under PayPal's fold through their $8…… million acquisition of Braintree in -…-'.Last year, Venmo handled$7.5billion in transactions and the company is already allowing merchants to accept Venmo as a payment option. PayPal is now taking it a step further to add an in-store payment option into Venmo. Eventually, you will be able topay for your grocerieswith your Venmo app that uses near-field communication technology (NFC), just like you would use Apple Pay or Android Pay. PayPal's digital wallet will first come to Android devices because of Apple's wall around its NFC chip that keeps third-party developers out of the loop. PayPal says that it is ""in discussions"" with Apple to see if they can work together in future. That might be unlikely considering the fact that Apple Pay is just taking off.This is a significant move for PayPal because they're moving from the web into mobile payments, whileApple Pay is movingfrom mobile payments into the web space. But PayPal has an advantage over other mobile wallets in the market because they already have a massive user base on the web. It is just a question of users switching their medium from desktops and laptops to smartphones. Apple Pay, on the other hand, doesn't have a significant web user base except perhaps for Safari users on iOS devices, which is now integrated with Apple Pay.""Ever sinceApple Pay took to the web, iOS users have been able to make payments on their Mac as well using Apple Pay. On mobile devices such as iPad and iPhone, you can now either use the Apple Pay app itself or access your Apple Pay account directly from the Safari browser. With this feature, Apple is trying to popularize web and mobile payments and make it convenient for you to switch over from using PayPal or other applications.""--redDrop.comSo as of now, PayPal does have a bit of a head start, though I expect the lead to vanish very soon. How quick PayPal is able to expand its mobile user base in the next two years will be the deciding factor in keeping the tech majors at bay.Disclosure:I have no positions in any of the stocks mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 7- hours.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Read More:US Market Indexes Lower as Probability for Rate     Hike IncreasesAlan Fournier Sold 6 Holdings in -nd QuarterHedge Funds Push Back on Buffett With Index Beat     in AugustAbout GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

Apple Needs the Series 2 Watch to Sell Well, But Will It?;9/9/2016;"At its highly anticipated keynote event on Wednesday, AppleAAPLunveiled the Apple Watch Series 2, the second generation of its smartwatch device. The Series 2 boasts a plethora of new features, and the tech giant will hope the new product can reinvigorate slumping Watch sales.Weak SalesApple is firmly in control of the smartwatch market, but that doesn't mean that Apple Watch sales have lived up to expectations. The company remains tight-lipped on specific sales numbers for the device, but it did say at Wednesday's keynote that it is number one in worldwide smartwatch sales.Nevertheless, a report from the International Data Corp (IDC) in July claimed that Apple Watch sales fell 55% in the second quarter. With global smartwatch sales falling 32% in the same time period, Apple definitely took a brutal hit, especially as competitors like LenovoLNVGYand SamsungSSNLFsaw sales increase by 50% in the quarter (also read:IDC Says Apple Watch Shipments Drop 55%).Why have Apple Watch sales been slumping? Well, a variety of factors go into its worldwide sales performance, but it seems reasonable to assume that customers are either uninspired by the device or opting for a competitor's version of the smartwatch.To remedy both of these problems, the Apple Watch Series 2 needs to be innovative, unique, and affordable. Now that Apple has officially announced the product, we can look to see whether the company has successfully tackled those three points.Series 2 FeaturesThe new generation of Apple Watches will include a dual-core processor that promises to be 50% faster than the original version. It also boasts a 2x brighter screen, making it Apple's brightest display to date. To help improve movement tracking, the Series 2 will feature a built-in GPS, and the new device will ""learn"" about you through a new algorithm that tracks your daily activity. Design wise, there will be new cases, including aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic, as well as new watch bands.Perhaps the ""coolest"" new feature of the Series 2 is its water-resistant capabilities. Apple promises that the watch will be ""swim-proof,"" meaning it can handle depths of up to 50 meters. Almost no other major smartwatch manufacturers have a swim proof option, and even Fitbit'sFITfitness trackers can't be brought into the pool.Apple also announced a partnership with NikeNKE; executives from the fitness apparel giant were on-hand Wednesday to announce the Apple Watch Nike +, a fitness-focused version of the new smartwatch that makes it easier to incorporate into workouts and encourages users to go on runs and be active.Alongside the announcement of the Series 2, Apple announced its latest Watch-based operating system, Watch OS3. The new OS will allow users to swipe the edge of their device to switch watch faces, and it will include new animated stickers, custom reply scribbling, improvements to typing, an activity sharing app, and an ""SOS"" app.Once again, pricing remains a concern with the Series 2. The new version starts at $369, while the Series 1 will receive a processor upgrade and will retail at $269. In comparison, Fitbit's Blaze is just $199 and Samsung's Gear S2 starts at $249.99.Bottom LineWith worldwide smartwatch sales slumping significantly in the second quarter, the demand for these types of devices is at a low right now. That means that any new product entering the market must be competitive in both design and price.The Apple Watch Series 2 is now the most powerful smartwatch on the market and its swim-proof capabilities are unparalleled. With that said, it's still a very pricy device, and many of its comparable competitors are more affordable.This doesn't feel like the outright win that Apple needed to ensure long-term Apple Watch success, but it should inspire some shoppers heading into the holiday season. I expect Apple to be more open about its Watch sales if things do pick up, so investors should pay attention to that.For more coverage on Apple's keynote this week, check out the latest episode of theZacks Friday Finish Linepodcast:Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Won’t Reveal iPhone 7 Launch Weekend Sales Numbers;9/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has become a tradition. The Monday after the first weekend a new iPhone is available for sale,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) issues a triumphant press release. Inevitably, a new sales record has been set. This year will be different, though. Apple has said it won't be revealing launch weekend iPhone 7 numbers.Source: AppleWhat's up with that?makeArticleAd();One of the primary reasons why AAPL has been so successful is its domination in smartphone sales. Yes,Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has a far larger platform market share with its Android operating system. And arch-rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) sells more mobile phones overall than Apple. But when it comes to flagship smartphone sales - the devices that people clamor for and that actually drive profits - the latest and greatest new iPhone is always the one to beat.These iPhone sales numbers, which invariably set a new sales record, go a long way toward predicting the success a new model will have during the course of the year, and are used by investors to help gauge the impact on AAPL stock.7 Must-Own Tech Stocks With REAL Dividend     GrowthIn 2013, the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were launched. Apple was only too happy to tell the worldhow impressive opening weekend sales had been:""Apple® today announced it has sold a record-breaking nine million new iPhone® 5s and iPhone 5c models, just three days after the launch of the new iPhones on September 20.""In 2014, for the iPhone 6, the standardfirst weekend salespress release went out:""Apple® today announced it has sold over 10 million new iPhone® 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, a new record, just three days after the launch on September 19.""In 2015, for the iPhone 6s launch, Apple put out a press releaseafter the first weekend of sales. It opened with the same formula:""Apple® today announced it has sold more than 13 million new iPhone® 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, a new record, just three days after launch.""Apple Will Sit This Year Out With the iPhone 7 LaunchAn Apple spokesperson toldReutersthatthe company will not be publishing launch weekend saleswhen the iPhone 7 hits store on Sept. 16. This begs the question: why break with the long-standing tradition?Here's Apple's explanation for the move:""These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers.""In other words, due to limited supply (there have been reports that somecomponents suffered manufacturing defectsthat have affected iPhone 7 launch availability), Apple is certain the iPhone 7 will sell out on launch weekend. Not only that, but it feels it would be able to sell many more new iPhones than it will have available, therefore any launch weekend sales numbers would be artificially low.Apple Inc. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Specs     (and Price (AAPL)That makes sense, but here's the thing. Previous new iPhone sales have also suffered from launch shortages. Some customers waited months to get their hands on an iPhone 6. A shortage of iPhone 5 units due to manufacturing issues with its display cut into that smartphone's launch weekend sales.Having full warehouses for launch weekends isalwaysa challenge, and not just for Apple. Any time a manufacturer ramps up production of a new device - often requiring assembly of components supplied by dozens of third parties - it takes time before all the bugs are ironed out and the production line is humming.So why is Apple using the supply shortage leads to sellout excuse to skip its annual tradition of releasing new iPhone opening weekend sales numbers?It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to speculate that perhaps the company is worried that already flat iPhone sales combined with an incrementally updated iPhone 7 and potential backlash over its decision to eliminate the headphone jack are going to combine for tepid sales.A press release stating iPhone 7 launch weekend sales failed to beat last year's numbers - even with any marketing speak about selling out - would not be pretty for AAPL.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Unveils iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2 and AirPods;9/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsThe fallApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) event held few surprises, raising questions about whether AAPL   can inspire consumers to upgrade this round.Apple took the wraps off the new iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2   and AirPods, offering incremental upgrades all around.makeArticleAd();The fall's most anticipated tech event has wrapped up for   another year, as Apple finally ended months of speculation   to reveal a basket of products.Wednesday's event was packed with new product reveals,   demos and previews. Apple CEO Tim Cook & Co. showed off audio   accessories, iOS games, a re-vamped Apple Music and versions of   Apple's various operating systems - all arriving this fall.But the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 were the stars of the   show.iPhone 7: Yup, the Headphone Jack is DeadWe've heard about it for months, and the rumors were   confirmed. The iPhone 7 has no headphone jack. Apple says not to   worry, though. It's including a pack-in Lightning-to-3.5 mm   adapter so you can plug in those old headphones if you really   must.7 Must-Own Tech Stocks With REAL Dividend         GrowthOther updates include a dual lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus   with optical zoom, a big boost in processing and graphics power,   IP67 water resistance, 32 GB as the new base storage and a new   Home button. You can get thefull details on our iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus   feature.Apple Watch Series 2IDC released figures Tuesday showingApple Watch sales took a dive in Q2, slumping by 56.7% compared to 2015.So Wednesday's announcement of the follow-up Apple Watch   Series 2 - could they not have simply called it the Apple Watch   2? - arrives just in time and should help sales recover. The form   factor looks exactly the same as the original. However, this time   around there's a new White Ceramic option replacing the gold   Edition.New for the Apple Watch Series 2 is a waterproof designation   to 50 meters, a built-in GPS, a display that's twice as bright as   the first generation and a snappy new CPU to drive higher   performance apps. With the ability to track swimming and a GPS   that accurately tracks movement without having to carry an iPhone   adding to its fitness cred, it's well-positioned to take on   competition fromFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), whose activity trackers have been gaining smartwatch-like   capabilities.Also helping to take on fitness tracker rivals is a new   collaborative offering fromNike Inc(NYSE:NKE), the Apple Watch Nike+, featuring exclusive Nike watch faces   and sports bands.In a further boost to its smartwatch sales ambitions, AAPL is   keeping the original Apple Watch (now the Series 1) as an   entry-level model. Pricing starts at $269 even though Apple is   updating it with the new dual-core CPU from the Series 2.AirPodsWe heard aboutApple filing to sell ""AirPods""a few days before the big event, and now we have conformation   that they are exactly what we suspected: Bluetooth wireless   earbuds.Well, Apple says they use a custom W1 wireless chip, but   beneath the marketing-speak, that appears to be Bluetooth   (eliminating the standard jack then also offering high end   wireless earbuds that are incompatible with everything but the   latest Apple devices probably would have been pushing it too   far).The AirPods have five-hour battery life, include a charging   case and feature Siri integration. And you can listen to music on   them. Apple describes them as ""magical"" in a generally   over-the-top series of zingers designed to discredit the   headphone jack.Pricing and Release DatesApple says theiPhone 7will start at $649, and are available for preorder starting     Sept. 9, with retail availability for Sept. 16.TheApple Watch Series 2(including the Nike+ models) starts at $369, with that fancy     White Ceramic option starting at $1,249. They     are available for preorder starting Sept. 9, with retail     availability for Sept. 16.AirPodsare $159 and will come out in late October.The new operating system releases arrive through September,     starting with iOS 10 and watchOS 3 on the 13th, followed by     macOS Sierra on the 20th, then tvOS 10.Apple needs the iPhone 7 to be a hit. However, with what   amounts to an incremental, lookalike update with the loss of the   headphone jack causing controversy, the outlook for this launch   wasn't exactly great. Still,Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) did hand Apple a gift with its explodingGalaxy Note 7 recall.Apple Inc. Reveals Super Mario Run at         iPhone 7 Event (AAPL)Preorders of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus start on   Friday, so we'll soon know if Apple was able to capitalize on its   rival's misfortune.

iPhone 7 Could Be Less Profitable For Apple;9/7/2016;"Apple (AAPL) is slated to unveil its latest iPhone (presumably called iPhone 7) on Wednesday. The iPhone product line has been facing challenges, amid competition from well-received Android based-devices and slowing demand in China, resulting in falling shipments and weaker ASPs. While the iPhone 7 - which is rumored to sport improved cameras, better water resistance and performance upgrades - may improve iPhone demand in the interim, we believe that it could put pressure on Apple's margins. Below, we outline some reasons for this.Trefis has a $120 price estimate for Apple, which is slightly below the current market price.See our complete analysis for Apple heremakeArticleAd();Higher Storage Can Skew Demand Towards Base   ModelsApple has been offering its base iPhone 6 and 6S series with just 16 GB of memory (under 12 GB of usable space - barely enough for mainstream customers), with 64 GB and 128 GB versions priced at $100 increments. This has worked out very well for Apple's margins, as a large portion of customers opted for the higher-end models, driving up ASPs. The 64 GB device, for instance, likely costs an additional $15 to $20 to manufacture compared to the 16 GB device, while retail prices are $100 higher. However, Apple is rumored to be offering the iPhone 7 with 32 GB of base storage - which could be sufficient for most typical users, with price points likely being left unchanged.  This could skew the sales mix towards the entry-level device, lowering margins and ASPs. Moreover, there could be incremental costs associated with doubling memory across the product line (32/128/256GB).iPhone Plus Bill Of Material Costs Will   RiseThe iPhone Plus models have also been significantly accretive for Apple's margins. For instance IHS estimates that the iPhone 6S Plus cost just about $20 more to manufacture compared to the iPhone 6S, although it retails at a $100 premium. While we expect price points on the new Plus devices to remain similar to last year's models, it is possible that it could get more expensive to manufacture. For instance, the dual-lens camera - rumored to be the marquee feature of the iPhone 7 - is likely to be exclusive to the Plus device.Yield rateson these components- which are still uncommon in the smartphone industry - are likely low, making them potentially expensive. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that these cameras could raise Apple's costs by about $40. This could hurt Apple's margins.Dated Design May Hinder Apple's Pricing PowerBy most accounts, the iPhone 7 is likely to sport an industrial design that is largely similar to the iPhone 6 (introduced in 2014) and 6S (2015), as Apple focuses on developing technologies for next year's 10th anniversary iPhone. The dated design could hurt Apple's pricing power, assmartphone customers have become increasingly accustomed to design innovation from Apple's rivals, who have been offering modular devices, bezel-free designs and curved displays. Apple had to resort to promotions and discounts during the 6S cycle, as customers saw the device as being very similar to iPhone 6. It's possible that the iPhone 7 could face similar issues if it doesn't offer sufficient design differentiation.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Note 7 Recall: A Near-Term Blow To Samsung's Resurgent Smartphone Unit;9/6/2016;"Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) announced a recall of its latest Galaxy Note 7 devices after reports that some units were exploding during charging. The firm has also halted distribution of the device, which was launched on August 19, and indicated that customers could swap their current device for a new one in the coming weeks.The latest developments create a significant overhang on Samsung's smartphone business, at a time when profitability has been surging, driven by a string of well-received new handset launches. The cost of the recall exercise could be sizable, and it could create near-term perception issues, hurting the company's recent momentum in the smartphone market.We have a$1370 price estimate for Samsung, which is roughly 10% ahead of the current market price.See our complete analysis for SamsungmakeArticleAd();Financial Impact Could Be LargeSamsung attributes the issue to a battery cell problem and said that 35 episodes had been reported worldwide. While batteries are a relatively inexpensive component of a smartphone's manufacturing cost (typically under $5 apiece), battery issues can prove costly for manufacturers. Although an unnamed Samsung official previously estimated that the defect was present in less than 0.1% of all the Note 7 devices sold, Samsung has said that it would be difficult to isolate the devices which were impacted and indicated that it would be replacing close to 2.5 million Note 7 devices that it has sold to date. Samsung has not disclosed the potential financial impact of the recall exercise, but we believe that it could run into several hundred million dollars, given the potentially high bill of materials of the Note 7 and the logistics involved.Hurting The Perception Of A High Profile DeviceThe smartphone markets are very perception-driven, and news of hardware issues could have a negative impact on future sales. While the Note lineup has typically been a high-margin/low-volume play targeted at power-users, the Note 7 appealed to mainstream customers as well, with its premium industrial design and features such as water proofing. Pre-orders for the device in South Korea alone exceeded 400k units, roughly double pre-orders for the Galaxy S7. Samsung has been counting on the device - priced at $850+ in the United States - to shore up its mobile ASPs, which stand at roughly a third of Apple's. The timing of the recall is also problematic for Samsung, given that Apple is expected to unveil its new iPhone 7 next week. The negative news-cycle around Samsung's product could steer potential customers towards Apple's new offerings.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap| U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"

If This Is GoPro Inc's Hero 5, Investors Should Worry;9/2/2016;"GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) hasn't launched any flagship cameras since the   Hero 4 Silver and Black in late 2014. Last year, it launched the   low-end Hero+, the mid-range Hero+ LCD, and the high-end Hero 4   Session. None of those devices were big hits with consumers, and   GoPro's sales rose just 16% for the year, down from 41% growth in   2014.Image source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();Demand for the Session was so weak that GoPro had to slash its   price from $400 to $200 before any buyers showed up. Margins fell   as sales of the cheaper devices cannibalized those of the   higher-end ones, so GoPro discontinued the entry-level Hero,   Hero+, and Hero+ LCD earlier this year. GoPro now only sells   three cameras -- the Hero 4 Session, Silver, and Black.Looking ahead, the holiday quarter will be a crucial one for   GoPro, since it plans to finally release its new Hero 5 flagship   devices and its long-delayed Karma drone. Analysts expect sales   of those two devices to boost GoPro's fourth quarter revenue by   54% annually, helping it finish the year with a 14% sales   decline. Unfortunately, the recently leaked specs for  the   Hero 5 indicate that the new flagship cameras won't represent a   huge leap forward from the Hero 4.Image source: GoPro.Is this the GoPro Hero 5?Leaked imagesof the Hero 5 indicate that the device will have a similar form   factor as GoPro's current lineup of cameras, contrary toearlier reportswhich suggested that it would retain the Session's cube-like   design. The two biggest changes appear to be a touchscreen on the   back and a built-in waterproof housing.Mirrorless Blogclaims that the device will  have a USB-C connector, a   slightly larger 1,220 mAh battery, a built-in GPS, and support   for voice controls. The leaked specs also indicate that image   stabilization would be available for all the models, but would   only work on resolutions under 4K.It also appears that the highest-quality video mode for all   models would be 4K at 30 fps. If that's true, it wouldmerely matchthe Hero 4 Black's highest video setting. Like the Hero 4 Black,   the Hero 5 is expected to offer higher frame rates (as high as   120 fps) at lower resolutions. It's unclear if GoPro will use a   newer image sensor fromSonyor a new image processing SoC fromAmbarella(NASDAQ: AMBA) , but the rumored specs look pretty underwhelming   for current owners of the Hero 4 Black.It doesn't measure up to the competitionThe action camera market has also drastically changed since   GoPro launched the Hero 4 two years ago.TomTomintroducedthe Bandit, a camera that can bookmark parts of videos based on the user's   movements, acceleration, and heart rate for easy editing.Samsung,Kodak,Ricoh, and360flylaunched affordable360-degree camerasfor capturing panoramic photos and videos for VR. Other   companies, like4GEEandBenQ, installedQualcomm's mobile-based SoCs into their action cameras for stand-alone 4G   connectivity.Samsung's $350 Gear 360. Image source: Samsung.Yi Technologyreleased a 4K action camera powered by  the same Ambarella   SoC as GoPro's Hero 4 Black forhalf the priceat $250. Yi even added image stabilization and a touch screen --   two key features the Hero 4 Black lacked.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which previously only partnered   with GoPro in its Jump VR initiative for YouTube, signed a   similar deal with Yi -- likely because itwould be cheaperto create VR rigs with Yi's cameras than with GoPro's.For the Hero 5 to be a hit this holiday season, it will need   to stand out in that crowded market with superior features and   competitive prices. But if the leaked specs for the Hero 5 are   accurate, the only features that set it apart are its waterproof   housing and voice controls. It's doubtful that customers --   either old or new ones -- will pay $400 to $500 for those   features.The key takeawayGoPro bulls believe that the company's lackluster sales growth   in 2015 was caused by its misguided attempts to reach mainstream   consumers with its cheaper devices, and that the launch of new   ""numbered"" Hero 5 flagship devices this year will get its growth   back on track.Unfortunately, a more likely story is that the company's   action cams simply filled out their niche with the strong sales   of the Hero 4. Since mainstream displays haven't moved beyond 4K   yet, there's no demand for higher resolution cameras, and the   Hero 4 Black -- along with most high-end smartphones -- already   record decent 4K videos. As a result, it's highly unlikely that   the Hero 5 can generate enough sales to reverse GoPro's ongoing   decline.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Unveiling New Beats Headphones Alongside iPhone 7;9/2/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEveryone knows by now thatApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) will be taking the wraps off a new iPhone 7 on Sept. 7. Now a leaked document from the PR team at Apple's Beats Electronics division shows AAPL is also going to be showing off three different pairs of new Beats headphones at the event.Source: Beats ElectronicsFrench websiteiGenerationwas accidentally e-mailed the news of the new headphonesby the Beats Electronics public relations team - who quickly sent a takedown notice of the supplied photos - so there is zero doubt it's legit.makeArticleAd();According toiGeneration, there will be three new models of Beats by Dre headphones announced by Apple on Sept. 7.New Beats Adds Fuel to the iPhone 7 Headphone Jack RumorProbably the most persistent rumor about the upcoming iPhone 7 has been thatit will ditch the headphone jack. This has also been the source of considerable controversy. That 3.5mm connector has been around for decades. Eliminating it in favor of using the Lightning port for digital audio has music fans up in arms.Apple looks to be following the lead of rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) by releasing its own Bluetooth wireless earbuds - or AirPods - but not all music fans are big on these. Earbuds can be uncomfortable, Bluetooth audio isn't the same quality as wired and wireless earbuds have a short battery life.Apple & Other Deeply Underloved Stocks     to Buy NowIt seems likely that AAPL will include a Lightning-to-headphone jack adapter so people can still use their traditional wired headphones with the iPhone 7. However, that's an imperfect solution.New Beats Lets AAPL Lead the Way in Lightning AudioWhen Apple unveils the new Beats headphones on Sept. 7, it's a sure bet that at least some of those are going to be Lightning-compatible.Showing off the new Beats gear beside the iPhone 7 accomplishes several key objectives for Apple, but two stick out:It lets AAPL change the narrative from the current   ""taking away the beloved headphone jack"" to one that's more   progressive. Having the new headphones that use the Lightning   adapter there to show off will give the opportunity to talk   specs, convenience and to play up the pure digital experience.   AAPL will be leveraging the new Beats headphones to convince   consumers their move to ditch the old-school analog headphone   jack is a good thing.Second, with new Lightning-compatible Beats front and center,   AAPL gets the first crack at what is likely to turn into a rush   to buy fancy new Lightning-compatible headphones. And while it's   nowhere near the size of the smartphone market, headphones are   big business.The market is predicted to hit $17.55 billion by   2023, and by forcing a new standard and then being right there with   premium offerings that were designed for that new standard, Apple   stands to grab a big chunk of that.So stay tuned for the Sept. 7 Apple event. It appears more certain than ever that you'll see new iPhone 7 models that your old-school headphones won't work with - at least not without a kludgy adapter.But that's OK, because AAPL will have some shiny new Beats by Dre Lightning headphones to sell you.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.

With the new Galaxy Note 7, the company shows it's still on top of the big smartphone game, turning out what many reviewers feel is the best smartphone of 2016.Source: SamsungIt's big, curved and water resistant, with an improved S Pen and new tricks, like an iris scanner for biometric unlocking (one-upping the fingerprint scanner everyone else uses).makeArticleAd();It also commands a hefty premium price, starting at roughly $850.Given the kudos the Galaxy Note 7 is already receiving and the impressive sales of Samsung's Note series over the years, there's little wonder that rivalApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumoredto be prepping a curved, premium phabletof its own.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) YouTube Red Is Killing     NetflixFor now, the Note 7 has the playing field pretty much to itself. Here's what you can expect from Samsung's newest premium phablet.Galaxy Note 7 Review: Sixth Time's a CharmSamsung has been making the Galaxy Note since 2011.Chronologically, the Note 7wouldhave been the Galaxy Note 6 (the Galaxy Note 5 was released last August), but Samsung wants to get the naming convention in sync with this years' Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.This time around, Samsung has fine-tuned the Note and run with the successful dual-curved screen design that made the Galaxy S7 Edge so popular.Only it's bigger, and it comes with additional features like the traditional Galaxy Note S Pen stylus, an iris scanner, mobile HDR (for dramatically improved video when streamed from HDR-supported services) and a USB-C port.Previous Galaxy Note models have been impressive, but with the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung's design team has hit one out of the park.Galaxy Note 7 Review: Making Amends to the Samsung FaithfulThe Galaxy Note 5 was a good smartphone, but it suffered from several issues.There was an S Pen stylus that could getpermanently jammedin its slot if an unfortunate user happened to insert it backwards. With move to a glass and metal design, the microSD card slot was jettisoned, infuriating those who depend on it for cheap storage.The Galaxy Note 7 not only adopts an even more stunning design, it makes amends for the previous model's missteps.The S Pen mechanism has been fixed, preventing jamming with the stylus itself significantly improved. A microSD card slot has been added and base storage boosted to 64GB. And, the Galaxy Note 7 gains an IP68 water resistance rating.After years of improving the Galaxy Note - along with one-offs like the Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy 6 Edge Plus - the new Note 7 is the big smartphone where everything comes together.Galaxy Note 7 Review: SpecsSource: Samsung5.7-inch QUAD HD Super AMOLED touch display (518 ppi), plus   dual edgesQuad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU64GB built-in storageMicroSD card slot (maximum 256GB)12MP primary camera with Pro Mode and 4K video802.11a/b/g/n/ac MU-MIMOBluetooth 4.23500 mAh battery rated at up to 38 hours talk time, 14 hours   Wi-FiWireless chargingIris scanner, fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensorIP68 water resistantIncludes integrated S Pen stylusAndroid MarshmallowGear VR-compatible, Samsung Pay-compatible6.0 x 2.91 x 0.31-inches, weighs 5.96 ouncesPrice $850 (varies by carrier)Galaxy Note 7 Review: ConclusionThe Galaxy Note 7 is indisputably the best super-sized smartphone on the market.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Skip iPhone Pro in     2016It looks beautiful, fits nicely in the hand, has an incredible display and takes fantastic photos.The problem is, Samsung already has another smartphone that does all this and for considerably less. The Galaxy S7 Edge has virtually the same features - including the same camera, water resistance and a Super AMOLED dual edge screen.The Galaxy S7 Edge's display is 5.5-inches, which is just a little smaller than the Note 7's 5.7-inches, but it's going for $200 less. The main differentiating feature is the Note-exclusive S Pen. If you're not into handwriting or scrawling notes, then that's a pretty expensive stylus.However, to sweeten the deal, Samsung is currently offering a free Gear Fit 2 GPS sports band with the purchase of a Galaxy Note 7. That's a $179 gadget, which is a pretty nice freebie and if you're in the market for a decent fitness wearable, it may be enough to justify the Note 7's steep price.The iPhone 7 Plus that Apple is expected to reveal in September seems unlikely to topple the Note 7, but the big question will be what happens if/when Apple releases a curved display iPhone? Until then, Samsung is sitting pretty at the top of the big smartphone market.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Does the Snapdragon 821 Signal What Lies Ahead for Qualcomm Inc?;8/31/2016;"Image source: Qualcomm.Earlier this year, wireless chip specialistQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) released its Snapdragon 820 processor. The 820 was   well-received and won the company a place inside theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S7 and Note 7 flagship smartphones, an   important recovery as the prior-generation Snapdragon 810   processor failed to make it into the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Note 5   releases.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, shortly after the Snapdragon 820 began shipping   in devices, Qualcomm went ahead and announced a higher-end   variant known as the Snapdragon 821 (not so much a ""successor""   since Qualcomm indicated that it will ship both the 820 and 821   simultaneously).Let's take a look at what the 821 brings to the table and what   Qualcomm hopes to achieve with this latest release.Same processor, now with faster clock speedsThe Snapdragon 821 appears to share the same basic   architectural design as the Snapdragon 820. Given the length of   chip development cycles, it would be unrealistic to expect a   substantial design change in a product released so soon after the   latest generation.That said, the Snapdragon 821 runs its processor cores and   graphics engine at higher frequencies, which should lead to   increased performance. AnandTech says that the Snapdragon 820   runs its high-performance processor cores at 2.15GHz and its   lower-performance processor cores at 1.59GHz. The Snapdragon 821,   on the other hand, bumps the former up to 2.34GHz and the latter   to 2.19GHz. The graphics processor sees a boost in frequency from   624 MHz to 653 MHz as well.These improvements in the speed of the processor cores should   help overall performance, including web surfing and app usage.   The graphics boost should make games and other graphically   intensive applications like virtual reality run more   smoothly.The beginning of more aggressive product segmentation     for Qualcomm?It would appear that Qualcomm is trying to get more aggressive   about segmenting its product lines in a bid to improve its   average selling prices and, ultimately, profitability.Qualcomm already categorizes its products broadly by tiers   (i.e., Snapdragon 200-series for entry-level phones, Snapdragon   400-series for mid-range, Snapdragon 600-series for high-end, and   Snapdragon 800-series for ""premium"" phones), but I think it could   benefit from additional segments within those tiers. By   releasing the Snapdragon 821, Qualcomm is offering potential   customers the opportunity to pay a bit more to get even stronger   performance.For some customers such as Samsung, that premium clearly   wasn't worth it. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7, for example,   doesn't feature the Snapdragon 821 but the older Snapdragon 820.   Companies with significant brand power, like Samsung, probably   don't see the value in paying more for a marketing point that   will likely be ignored by the vast majority of their   customers.However, it's worth noting thatASUSTek, a company well-known in the personal computer market but less   so for smartphones, is adopting the Snapdragon 821 in its ZenFone   3 family of products. Since ASUSTek doesn't have anywhere close   to the recognition of a brand like Samsung, it's probably hoping   that the use of the latest Snapdragon 821 might help its products   appeal more to customers.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Headphone Jack Is Going Extinct;8/31/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the worst-kept secrets aboutApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 is now all but confirmed. European sales certificates leaked for Apple AirPods wireless headphones - documentation that would appear to be the final nail in the headphone jack's coffin.Why Ditch the Headphone Jack with iPhone 7?Source: Twitter, @the_malignantRumors have been flying for months that Apple was ditching the headphone jack with the iPhone 7. It quickly turned into a flashpoint issue. Many people thought AAPL would be ridiculous to eliminate support for a standard port that has been in use for decades. Especially when the move makes existing wired headphones useless without an adapter of some sort.makeArticleAd();Some are concerned about forcing users to adopt headphones that plug into the iPhone 7's Lighting port, or to turn to wireless headphones like the AirPods. They think that way, Apple has the opportunity to interject DRM (digital rights management) into the listening experience. Plus, wireless headphones still can't match the quality of wired audio and rely on batteries that must be recharged.10 Stocks Caught in the Trump-Clinton Election     WarPosts written about the strategy tend to be along the lines of this reaction fromThe Verge:""Taking the headphone jack off phones is user-hostile and stupid.""From Apple's perspective, the primary reason for getting rid of the headphone jack seems to be to make it easier to create a waterproof iPhone. Maybe AAPL wants to shave another millimeter off the newest iPhone, too.Enter the AirPodsIf there was any hope that Apple Inc. would bow to pressure and stick with the traditional headphone jack for the iPhone 7, that pretty much died with aMacRumorsreport yesterday. The website discovered regulatory certification from the Eurasian Economic Union, for anew Apple product called AirPods.Pair that official documentation with the leaked photos that purportedly showed wireless earbuds packed in with what appears to be a boxed iPhone 7, and it seems highly likely that we won't just be seeing an iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus unveiled at Apple's Sept. 7 event. It appears pretty much a done deal that the headphone jack will be buried then as well.That will leave iPhone fans to choose between a Lightning adapter to plug in their old-school wired headphones or new AirPods wireless earbuds from Apple.Even though the photos that have been circulating appear to show the AirPods as pack-ins with the iPhone 7, that seems like an unlikely move on AAPL's part.Bluetooth earbuds command a premium price right now. RivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) released itsGear IconX wireless earbudsearlier this year, and they're priced at $200.What's Coming Sept. 7Instead, the more realistic scenario is that on Sept. 7, CEO Tim Cook will unveil the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, minus the headphone jack.He'll play up the space savings and water resistance gains made by abandoning the ""ancient"" technology, and will laud the advances of digital sound delivered by the Lightning port. He'll point out that Apple will keep supporting you in your ancient ways by providing a Lighting adapter in the iPhone 7 box so you can continue using dusty old gear. And then he'll take the wraps off a new premium, ultimate audio solution, the Apple AirPods - undoubtedly referencing Beats technology as part of the substantial price tag.That's my guess, but we'll find out for sure in one week.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:The 10 Best Cheap Stocks in the WorldApple Inc.

How Samsung Is Moving to Become a Major Player in Electric Cars;8/30/2016;"Samsung currently ships the batteries for BMW's i3 to Germany   from South Korea. It said that it will build a battery factory in   Hungary that will open in 2018. Image source: BMW.South Korean giantSamsung Group(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) said it will spend about $358 million to build   a factory in Hungary that will make battery cells for electric   vehicles. It's the latest in a series of moves that suggest   Samsung is intent on becoming a big player in the auto industry's   ongoing transformation.makeArticleAd();A new battery factory in EuropeThe Group's Samsung SDI unit said it will spend about 400   billion won ($358 million) to build a battery-cell factory at a   site near Budapest. The factory is expected to start production   in the second half of 2018, and the company said it will be able   to produce batteries for up to 50,000 pure battery-electric   vehicles (or a larger number of plug-in hybrids) per year.Samsung SDI's current customers includeBMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) . Samsung currently makes the batteries for   BMW's i3 at a plant in South Korea and ships them to Leipzig,   Germany, where the i3 is assembled. That's fine for a   small-volume program, but as BMW continues to ramp up its   electric-car plans, it makes sense for Samsung to have a battery   plant closer to BMW's home base.Samsung is pushing to become a major force in     autosIn recent months, Samsung has boosted its efforts to become a   major player in the fast-transforming global auto business. Last   month, the company spent $449 million to acquire a 4% stake inBYD(NASDAQOTH: BYDDY) , the Chinese maker of batteries and vehicles   that is partially owned byBerkshire Hathaway. Samsung is also reported to be in talksto buy key auto-industry supplier Magneti   Marellifrom its current owner,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.Samsung is playing catch-up against rivals likeLG Chem(NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) andPanasonicin the race to supply the world's automakers with   batteries. Tightening environmental rules around the world have   most of the major automakers moving aggressively to incorporate   hybrid and plug-in technology into their fleets, with a   longer-term goal of moving to fully electric propulsion over the   next couple of decades.Right now, Korean rival LG Chem is well aheadAt the moment, LG Chem is well ahead of Samsung. LG Chem   supplies batteries and technology to about 25 automakers around   the world. It's the key supplier behindGeneral Motors' Chevrolet Bolt EV, set to become the first affordable   200-mile battery-electric car when it goes into production this   fall.Back in April, LG Chem said it will build its own European   battery factory in the Polish city of Wroclaw. That factory,   expected to open in late 2017, will be significantly larger than   Samsung SDI's Hungarian plant, with the ability to make enough   batteries for 229,000 fully electric cars a year.LG Chem's European battery customers includeRenault, Volvo Cars, andVolkswagen(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , as well as VW subsidiaryAudi. VW is beginning a massive shift toward plug-in hybrids and   fully electric vehicles, withfive new electric VWs in development, though it's reportedly considering the idea ofbuilding its own battery factory in Germany. Audi is expected to launch anelectric luxury SUVwith about 300 miles of range in the first half of 2018.The ground is being laid for a transformation of the     auto businessIt's clear the auto industry is changing quickly. Sales of   plug-in hybrids are expected to grow rapidly over the next decade   as air-pollution regulations tighten (and as the technology   improves). Many in the industry believe plug-in hybrids will help   consumers get used to the idea of electric cars, smoothing the   transition to a fully electric vehicular future.Obviously, the auto industry's supply chains will have to   evolve to keep up with this transformation. It's still very early   days, but it's clear that Samsung is moving now to become a major   player in the post-gasoline automotive future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Tacks on Important New Services, Features;8/30/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWords like ""exciting"" and ""Fitbit stock"" have not been compatible sinceFitbit Inc's (NYSE:FIT) IPO last year. The company has done everything right, answering its critics, yet FIT can't seem to catch a break.Source:Denis Kortunov via Flickr (Modified)It almost seems like the more that Fitbit management beats expectations and raises guidance, the louder criticisms become. Well, explainable stock performance can only happen so long before logic starts to prevail. In the case of Fitbit stock, it is finally starting to creep higher.makeArticleAd();With the company's vision becoming clear, the end of 2016 is setting up to be quite special for FIT stock owners.Criticism for FIT StockFitbit has had mind-boggling growth. Its IPO came the same year thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) entered the wearables market. While Fitbit only operated in the basic wearables market, it still finished 2015 as the No.1 wearables company.Its first smartwatch, the Blaze, went on to sell millions of units and be a commercial success despite not using Android or iOS operating systems. In the world of connected and smart hardware, Fitbit is one of the only companies we have seen to have success using an operating system that's not iOS or Android.The Best ETFs: A Special ReportDespite all of this success, the big knock against Fitbit and FIT stock is that the company does not have a recurring revenue stream. It's all hardware and one-time sales - Wall Street does not like that. It means that investors are always looking ahead, and wondering how long Fitbit can hold off tech juggernauts. That's why I have said repeatedly that Fitbit needs tolaunch serviceswithin its network, and create an ecosystem.Fitbit: The Vision Becomes ClearHowever, what Fitbit is doing might be even better. On Monday, the company announced aslew of new featuresand designs to both its best-selling Alta and Blaze, along with product refreshes for two other units.Furthermore, the company is partnering with leading fashion brands like Public School, Vera Wang,Kohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS), and Tory Burch to deliver accessory options. This gives those specific brands an incentive to showcase Fitbit products. Furthermore, it allows users to personalize their products.Speaking of which, Fitbit is rolling out new software that includes five new clock faces, something I had previously suggested. This gives an added layer for customizing products, which seems to be Fitbit's preferred direction.It is becoming quite clear that the second segment that Fitbit needed is accessories. The company has launched countless bands to customize its wearables and now has brand-specific accessories along with new clock faces. Hence, Fitbit is making its wearables more stylish, and by doing so, it creates an opportunity to up-sell the millions of devices it has sold over the last few years.Finally, Fitbit's new software update will allow users to customize the notifications they receive from apps like Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, Skype, Snapchat and WhatsApp, among others. Thus, Fitbit's Blaze just became a lot more like Apple Watch, but still cheaper and still easier to use.As previously reported, Fitbit CEO James Parkknows better than anyonewhat users want with their smartwatch. These notifications are yet one more example.Caesars Entertainment Corp (CZR): The Shell     Game Is OverPark realizes that a watch is too small for interactive apps, but is perfect for notifications since most consumers carry their watches with them, but don't always have their smart watch in hand. Ultimately, embracing notifications over apps is yet one more decision that should bode well for Fitbit sales moving forward.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockAll things considered, I still think Fitbit needs to do more around services and software to create recurring revenue streams.However, I also believe that building software around notifications and custom hardware is the way to go for a company that's competing against iOS and Android. These moves make sense, and with Fibit creating a second segment in accessories and now refreshing software and legacy hardware, there are reasons to be optimistic about Fitbit stock in the final months of 2016.Remember, Fitbit wasking of the holidayslast year, and really has not missed a beat since. FIT is now trading at just 10x fiscal year 2017 earnings-per-share and has the potential to blow past its own expectations with so many new accessories, product refreshes, and the likelihood for Blaze and Alta upgrades ahead of the holidays.With nearly 40% of Fitbit stock's float being short, and with it so cheap, there is a high likelihood that FIT stock soars to end 2016.As of this writing, Brian Nichols owns Fitbit and Apple.More From InvestorPlace7 Companies That Could Go Bankrupt Soon7 Rare Value Stocks in This Overpriced     MarketThe postFitbit Inc (FIT) Tacks on Important New Services, Featuresappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) What to Expect From Apple Watch 2;8/30/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis fall,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) isn't just going to unveilnew iPhones. The company is also expected to take the wraps off its second-generation smartwatch, the Apple Watch 2.We won't know everything for sure until then, but for now, here's what we know and what to expect from the newest Apple Watch.makeArticleAd();Source: Brad MoonBuilding on Apple Watch SuccessApple announced its first smartwatch in late 2014, then began shipping the Apple Watch in April 2015.Apple immediately dominated worldwide smartwatch sales, despite a multiyear head start by companies likeSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),PebbleandLenovo's(OTCMKTS:LNVGY) Motorola Mobility.However, being the top smartwatch didn't necessarily translate into the iPhone level of revenue some had been hoping for. Estimates areAAPL sold 12 million Apple Watches in its first year. Sure, $6 billion isn't nothing - the WSJ pointed out it was three times annual revenue forFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT). But for comparison's sake, iPhones generated $31 billion in Q3 2015 alone.With the Apple Watch 2, Apple clearly hopes to boost those numbers.7 Stocks That Could Fall to the ""Restaurant     Recession""The primary strategy will be releasing a second-generation product that addresses the key complaints about version one.What to Expect From Apple Watch 2The original Apple Watch wasn't perfect, but its success in capturing over 60% of the market in 2015 suggests AAPL got many of the design fundamentals right the first time. So don't expect any shocking changes with the Apple Watch 2. It's not going to do an about-face from square to circular, for example - despite that trend with competing smartwatches.Skipping radical changes avoids the appearance that Apple is flailing and makes it easier on app developers, who don't have to make significant UI changes between first and second generation devices. It also keeps accessory compatibility, avoiding angering early adopters who invested in expensive add-on Apple Watch bands like the $690 Hermès Cuff.Instead, expect Apple to fine-tune that original design.Among the expected changes with the Apple Watch 2 are:Faster CPU for improved performanceHigher capacity battery for longer lifeBuilt-in GPS and barometerImproved water resistanceThe changes are all focused on addressing criticisms of the original Apple Watch. Particularly that it is too slow when using apps and suffers short battery life. Health and fitness tracking also remains a key objective.The original Apple Watch was good - with excellent apps and hardware like a heart rate sensor. But it needed an iPhone nearby to track distances accurately by GPS. The addition of a GPS, barometer and improving water resistance will help AAPL to position the Apple Watch 2 as a full-featured and standalone alternative to fitness trackers from Fitbit.For months, rumors had the Apple Watch 2 being equipped with an LTE radio. This would let it break the iPhone tether altogether. It appears thatconcerns over the battery drain of a cellular chiphave quashed those plans. At least for this year …When Will Apple Watch 2 Arrive?That is the big question. Not if, but when. AAPL took its time in introducing the original, but that device has been on sale for over a year. Hopes it would announce the follow-up at its March event didn't pan out. Instead, new Apple Watch bands were released and prices were cut by $50.The smart money is betting on a fall release for the Apple Watch 2, possibly at the September iPhone event. That timing would make sense since it would give Apple ammunition to take on popular new rivals like the Fitbit Blaze during the all-important holiday shopping season.The Apple Watch 2 also could take advantage of smartphone shoppers checking out the iPhone 7. With iPhone upgraders in Apple Stores, AAPL could demonstrate the new smartwatch in hopes of making a double sale.Apple's iPhone 6 Touch Disease Is SpreadingFinally, the new watchOS operating system arrives in September, promising a huge improvement in usability and boosted performance. Having the highly anticipated watchOS release arrive on new hardware - for a one-two punch - would be ideal.Aside from the strategic reasons for a fall release, there is a key indicator that Apple is getting ready for a launch. As reported by9to5Mac,Apple Watch prices are droppingat national retailers and are now effectively starting at $199. That's $100 below the new discounted price AAPL introduced in March. And it's a pretty reliable sign that retailers are trying to clear out existing stock to make room for new gear … like the Apple Watch 2.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.

Is This Apple iPhone 7 Leak Legit?;8/26/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to unveil next-generation iPhones at   an event early next month. Although quite a lot has been leaked   about these new devices, there's still plenty about them that we   won't know for certain until Apple actually launches them.makeArticleAd();That being said, pre-launch rumors are interesting, and I   believe it's worthwhile to try to sniff out whether a particular   leak is legitimate or just a cleverly done fake designed to grab   attention. To that end, I'd like to look at arecent leakvia Tencent Digital to see if it makes sense.The leak shows a number of things: results of a common mobile   processor performance test known as Geekbench 3, a new display   feature, and the naming of the device. Let's dig into each of   these separately.Geekbench 3 scoreWhenever Apple launches a new iPhone, it likes to highlight   the performance improvements that it has brought to the table   relative to the prior-generation phone. The two main comparisons   that Apple makes are in CPU performance. (This impacts how fast   the phone runs most non-gaming/3D graphics-intensive   applications.)The leak doesn't tell us about what enhancements to graphics   Apple may have made with the A10 chip, but it does -- if it's   legitimate -- tell us what advancements Apple has made on the CPU   side of things. Per the leak, the next-generation iPhone   achieves a 3,042 single-core score and a 5,210 multi-core score   in Geekbench 3. I ran the test on my iPhone 6s Plus (powered by aSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) -built A9 chip), and my device achieved a   single-core score of 2,523 and a multi-core score of 4,358.If the leak is representative of the A10's final performance,   then we're looking at a per-core performance improvement of   nearly 21% and a dual-core performance improvement of 20%.Given that the A10 won't have the benefit of an enhanced   manufacturing technology, which means that all of the   improvements are coming from design/architectural work on Apple's   part, 20% improvement is impressive, but not out of the realm of   possibility. So, at the very least, I believe this portion of the   leak is legitimate.New display featureAn image that was part of the same leak showed that the new   iPhone offers the user the option to enable a ""true tone""   display. This was a feature that first made its debut on the   9.7-inch iPad Pro that launched back in March. This feature,   according to Apple, ""uses advanced four-channel ambient light   sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the   display to match the light in your environment.""Speaking from personal experience, this feature is really   quite nice, and actually makes the transition from using my iPad   Pro to my iPhone 6s a little difficult. I'd be shocked if Apple   omitted this feature from a next-generation iPhone, so this   portion of the leak checks out for me.A strange nameThe leak also shows that the Geekbench 3 test identifies the   phone not as the iPhone 7, but instead, as the iPhone 6 SE. I've   already written about why such branding would be nothing short of   aterrible marketing decision, and I stand by that belief.The last thing that Apple needs to do with this new iPhone --   the device that's going to be the company's best shot at putting   its iPhone business back on a growth path -- is to give consumers   the impression that the new device is merely a modest,   incremental update to the current-generation devices.It's not clear to me why the Geekbench 3 benchmark identifies   the device as the iPhone 6 SE, but I would be stunned if this   were the official marketing name for this device.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

"Amazon's Three ""Internet of Things"" Devices Lead Market";8/26/2016;"Over the past several years, the world has watched as AmazonAMZNtransformed itself from an e-commerce website into one of the largest and most diverse technology companies in the world. These days, Amazon is a leader in several emerging tech sectors, including cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT).By now, most of us have heard the praise for Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This line of cloud-based products and services provides businesses with the tools needed to build an online presence, all while providing Amazon with a solid revenue stream backed by impressive margins.One branch of the AWS tree is AWS IoT, a managed cloud platform that enables connected devices to easily and securely interact with other devices and cloud applications. AWS IoT can reliably process and route trillions of messages to AWS endpoints and devices, allowing your applications and devices to communicate with each other all the time.On top of this, Amazon has a growing line of IoT devices, which should put the company in a leadership position as the demand for these products continues to grow, especially at the consumer level. Let's check Amazon's line of IoT devices below:1.Echo SpeakerThe Echo is Amazon's flagship IoT device and one of the most popular home integration products on the market right now. This ""smart speaker"" can stream music with 360 degree audio, and it also uses Amazon's Alexa Voice Service, allowing users to interact with the device by speaking to it. The Echo can control a wide variety of compatible devices, including Alphabet'sGOOGLNest smart home technology, Samsung'sSSNLFSmartThings, and certain lights and switches.After the initial success of the Echo, Amazon released two new speakers that vary in size, price, and performance. The Echo family now includes the original Echo, the Tap, and the Echo Dot.2.Dash ButtonsAmazon's Dash program has quickly picked up in popularity since its launch just two years ago. The original Amazon Dash product is a barcode scanner that pairs with AmazonFresh, allowing users to scan barcodes in their homes and add them to their online shopping lists.Later, Amazon would release a line of branded Dash buttons (pictured above). The idea is that shoppers can place these buttons throughout their homes, near the related product, and instantly reorder them from Amazon when the time is right.3.Internet of Things Dash ButtonThe Internet of Things Dash Button was launched as a technological fix for a hack in the original Dash Buttons that allowed users to use the buttons for their own commands, including ordering pizza and controlling lights. The IoT Dash Button now encourages users to program their own commands. This button serves as an introduction to the AWS IoT platform and allows users to configure button clicks to count or track items, call or alert someone, start or stop something, order services, or even provide feedback.Bottom LineAs you can see, Amazon's IoT devices are relatively simple products designed to make life slightly easier for Amazon customers-and that's the whole idea behind the Internet of Things! The technology isn't necessarily life changing, but it makes tasks like adjusting the lights or ordering groceries that much easier. These types of products could become commonplace in the average home very soon, and Amazon already has a huge head start.For more coverage on the Internet of Things, check out this week's episode of the Zacks Friday Finish line!Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 to Lose Home Button in 2017;8/26/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the launch of the iPhone 7 just weeks away, media attention has been shifting to what comes next forApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). And ""what comes next"" could be rattling for some.Bloombergis now reporting that the iPhone 8 in 2017 will lose the iconic Home button.Source: AppleAAPL is expected to to take the wraps off the iPhone 7 by mid-September. Normally the rumor mill would be in overdrive at this point, filled with speculation about Apple's new iPhone.makeArticleAd();Itisactive … however, much of the posting is looking ahead to 2017's iPhone 8.The iPhone 7 Looks BoringThe iPhone 7 is getting less attention than normal because it has every indication of being boring. For months, spy shots and insider info have seeped out visions of a new iPhone that looks virtually identical to last year's model. And the one from the year before. Internals will be tweaked, and the iPhone 7 Plus will likely get an improved dual camera system. But there's little excitement around it.In fact, the current speculation around the iPhone 7 is that it won't be called that at all. Instead, Apple might dub it theiPhone 6SE. If that one pans out, it would feel like even AAPL was shrugging.The Best ETFs on the Planet: A Special     ReportThe iPhone 8 could be radically different.So with little excitement around the iPhone 7, attention is starting to be filtered even further into the future.Apple is moving to athree-year product cycle on its iPhones, making 2017 and the iPhone 8 the next big release. There have already been multiple claims that the company isadopting a curved OLED displayon at least one iPhone model, taking a page from the design book of rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).Now a new report fromBloombergis suggesting the iPhone 8 will adopt an even more radical change.iPhone 8 Says Goodbye to the Home ButtonOne element that has remained consistent since the original iPhone was released in 2007 is the Home button. Year after year, the physical button is there on the bottom of the iPhone's front face. Sure, Apple has improved it. Notably, building in the Touch ID fingerprint sensor was a big leap forward. But it has always been there.However,Bloomberg'sMark Gurman reported yesterday thatthe iconic button is on its way out:""Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button""AsMacRumorspoints out, Apple design guru Jony Ive has long wanted to build an iPhone with a front that lacks bezels andlooks like a single sheet of glass. The Home button destroys that minimalist aesthetic.Not to mention that thephysical button is a point of failureanda potential access point for water. In the quest for a more durable and waterproof iPhone, eliminating the Home button would definitely help.However, Home button functionality is critical to iOS, so Apple couldn't literally scrub it. Instead, Apple would need to use improvements to the 3D touch pressure sensitivity introduced with the iPhone 6S to create a virtual Home button and fingerprint scanner integrated into the display.2017 is a huge year for Apple. It's the first launch year in the new three-year iPhone release cycle. More importantly, it also marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. And it comes as iPhone sales - critical to AAPL's bottom line - continue to lose momentum. Those are three big reasons why AAPL is expected to pull out all the stops.Apple Touch Disease Is a Ticking Time BombAn iPhone 8 with a slick glass front that eliminates bezels and ditches the old-school Home button would definitely make a splash.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:What We Think We Know About the iPhone 7Apple Expected to Release a Third iPad Pro in     2017The postApple Inc.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone SE Is Failing in India: What Investors Should Know;8/25/2016;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has hoped for a while now that its iPhones would   find their footing in India, the world's second-largest   smartphone market.The company has madesomeprogress in the country, with India recently allowing Apple to   open its own stores in the country. That will eventually allow   Apple to sell phones directly to consumers, instead of   through third-party retailers like it does now.makeArticleAd();But newsmartphone shipment datarecently released by IDC brought back to light Apple's problems   in India.The IDC data shows that Apple still trails behind the market   leaderSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) in the country and is fighting an uphill   battle against Chinese vendors as well.The new iPhone SE, debuted back in March, was supposed to help   Apple gain a foothold in India. The device sports a 4-inch Retina   display, 12-megapixel rear camera, and is powered by Apple's A9   processors and M9 motion co-processor.But despite the specs and cheaper price (it starts at $399 in   the U.S.), the phone is failing to deliver in India. According to   IDC, ""Apple's iPhone SE failed to make any significant impact in   the premium segment while its previous generation iPhone 5S   continued to contribute majority volume.""Apple is, of course, expensive in India. The average price for   a smartphone in the country is about $150, and Apple's phones   begin selling in India for 39,000 rupees (about $580). For that   price, consumers can easily get a larger Android device with   similar specs and much more internal memory.The iPhone SE not only failed to make a dent in the country's   smartphone market, but it was also unsuccessful in capturing the   majority of the high-end market. That position belongs to Chinese   vendors, which now hold one-third of the high-end market in India   (up from just 9% a year ago).That growth has been spread out amongLenovo, Xiaomi and some other Chinese companies. In the past, Lenovo   was the only Chinese vendor to ship over 1 million smartphones in   India in a  quarter. Now there are three Chinese vendors   doing it.Where Apple goes from hereApple is much closer to selling its phone from its own stores   in India after a recent proposal was ratified by India's finance   minister. This means that Apple, and other single-brand companies   that make high-tech goods, don't have to follow India's current   law that requires foreign companies to source at least 30% of   their devices' material from India.Having Apple stores in India might eventually help the   company's brand in the country, but I think the only way the   iPhone maker is going to make any headway is to lower prices.Apple's iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, is building a new plant   in India that's rumored to be for Apple device production. If it   is, and Apple makes some of its iPhones in India, then the   company may be able to lower its iPhone prices to better compete   with other companies.Or, it could simply drop the prices before that in order to   gain some sliver of market share. At this point, Apple needs to   be more aggressive in getting Indian consumers to buy its devices   -- and it's becoming increasingly clear that the iPhone SE isn't   the best strategy.India is too large of a market for Apple to keep getting it   wrong. If the company's notoriously high margins have to be   shaved just a little in order to increase sales, then it might   just be well worth the sacrifice.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Workday Manages Another Solid Beat and Raise;8/25/2016;"Image source: Workday, Inc.Workday, Inc.(NYSE: WDAY) released fiscal second-quarter 2017 results   Wednesday after the market close, and the enterprise cloud   application specialist is rightly pleased with its progress, as   it continues to prioritize revenue growth and taking market share   over its near-term profitability.makeArticleAd();Workday's headline numbersQuarterly revenue grew 33.6% year over year to $377.7 million,   including a 36.9% increase in subscription revenue, to $306.2   million, and 21.3% growth from professional services, to $71.5   million. During the subsequent conference call, management also   confirmed total derived billings -- or the sum of revenue and the   sequential change in total unearned revenue -- were $431 million,   up 38% from the same year-ago period.By comparison, Workday's guidanceprovided last quartercalled for lower revenue in the range of $371 million to   $373 million, while assuming 35% to 36% growth in subscription   revenue, to a range of $303 million to $304 million, and 15% to   17% growth in professional services. That guidance also called   for total derived billings to grow a more modest 34% year over   year, to around $420 million.Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that   translated to a net loss of $108 million, or $0.55 per share. On   an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding   items like stock-based compensation, Workday's net loss was $8.6   million, or $0.04 per share.Digging deeperWorkday CEO Aneel Bhusri added, ""We delivered record   second-quarter results with solid customer momentum and strong   competitive win rates. The results were well balanced across our   key initiatives, as we saw consistent strength across product   lines, industries, and geographies, and we are proud to welcome   our new largest customer based in the APJ region.""To be sure, Workday continued to enjoy solid momentum with the   global adoption of its Human Capital Management solution,   including -- as I noted in myearnings previewearlier this week -- an expanded multiyear strategic   partnership under whichIBMwill support its entire global workforce of over 350,000   employees. Workday also saw new HCM adopters including Kering   (47,000 employees) andRepsol(30,000 employees) in the EMEA region, while at the same   time welcomingSamsungas its first South Korean customer, as well asQantasand Air New Zealand in the ANZ region. Workday also enjoyed   a happy consequence of the impending close of Dell's acquisition   ofEMC, as Dell expanded its Workday subscription to bring its total   employee count to 125,000.Workday also achieved itssecond-strongestquarter in company history for securing new financial management   customers, with almost a third of all new customers purchasing   Workday Financial Management. Moreover, Bhusri revealed during   the call that competitive win rates in the financial management   arena are now similar to the typically high rates enjoyed in its   core Human Capital Management space, which remain largely   unchanged from last quarter.Regarding newer product offerings, for which Workday's core   HCM platform tends to serve as a gateway for upselling, Workday   has already signed more than 50 customers for the new Workday   Planning product, which is on track for general availability with   the launch of Workday 27 next month. Management also promised   more details on the impending launches of Workday Learning and   Workday Student at the company's Financial Analyst Day, scheduled   for Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016.Workday also acquired operational analytics and data discovery   tools provider Platfora during the quarter. During the call,   management noted the purchase was similar to Workday's previous   acquisitions, as it was ""focused on acquiring world-class   technology and talent."" In the coming quarters, Bhusri says   Workday will focus on building Platfora's technology ""into the   fabric of our technology platform.""On guidanceWorkday offered fresh color on what to expect for the   remainder of the year. For the current (fiscal third) quarter,   Workday expects total derived billings for the quarter to   increase 31% year over year to $445 million. And as a   result, fiscal Q3 revenue should be in the range of $398   million to $400 million, representing year-over-year growth of   30% to 31%. That includes 36% to 37% growth in subscription   revenue, to a range of $331 million to $333 million, and   professional services growth of just 7% -- albeit primarily as   the company continues to push more services to its ecosystem.For the full fiscal-year 2017, Workday now expects derived   billings of $1.88 billion to $1.89 billion (up from previous   guidance for $1.87 billion to $1.885 billion) and total revenue   of $1.548 billion to $1.558 billion (up from $1.545 billion to   $1.555 billion previously). The latter range now assumes fiscal   2017 subscription revenue of $1.278 billion to $1.285 billion,   marking a slight increase to the bottom end of Workday's previous   subscription revenue guidance range.In the end, this was a straightforward beat-and-raise scenario   from Workday, and you'll be hard pressed to find an investor   willing to complain about these solid results.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Especially when Steve Wozniak is airing his thoughts on the much-derided rumor to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7.Source: Apple""If it's missing the 3.5-millimeter earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people,""said Wozniak- one assumes from a pulpit, because he was preaching to the choir.makeArticleAd();It's touted in some circles as thenatural progression of technology; in the vein of the 1998 killing off of floppy disk drives by the iMac, the lack of Flash in the iPhone and the single USB-C port on the latest MacBook. In other circles, it's consideredconsumer-unfriendly.Wozniak appears to fit in with the latter circle:""I would not use Bluetooth … I don't like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.""Thank you, Woz.7 Tech Stocks That Will Pop 10% or MoreBut if Apple truly has decided to forego the traditional headphone jack in favor of a slimmer, more adapter-friendly iPhone, then even the words of the great Woz cannot send Apple back to the drawing board.The iPhone 7 is expected in September, possibly Sept. 16, and is likely an incremental upgrade rather than full overhaul.Its operating system isn't in for any major changes, either. (I've been using iOS 10 in beta form for a few weeks now, and the differences are more aesthetic than anything.) The slim factor will likely be touted as a key selling point.So, we're sorry, Steve … looks like you're going to have to stand in line with the rest of us for an overpriced adapter.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Copy Samsung’s Curves in New iPhone;8/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is known for being a design leader, not a follower. But it looks as though the company is preparing to copy a major design cue from rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). A new report suggests Apple will release a new iPhone next year that features a big, AMOLED display that's curved on both edges.Source: Apple/SamsungApple and Samsung have a history when it comes to copying smartphone designs. Usually, Samsung has been on the hot seat for stealing iPhone features. In fact, the company has been successfully sued by AAPL for that reason, at one point owing $980 million in damages. (That reward was reduced after an appeals court ruledApple couldn't patent the basic design of the iPhone.)makeArticleAd();Samsung may regret that appeal, because if a report byNikkei Asian Reviewis correct,Apple is planning to copy the basic design of Samsung's popular Galaxy Note 7.A New iPhone That Borrows From the Galaxy Note 7Citing ""a source familiar with Apple's plans,""Nikkeisays Apple is working on an all-new iPhone for 2017. This would be a premium model, aimed squarely at the Galaxy Note 7.It wouldn't just be priced as Apple's new flagship - sitting above the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - it would be large and feature a completely different look. It would be the first iPhone to feature an AMOLED display. And that display would be curved to wrap around both sides of the new iPhone.7 of the Worst Stocks on Wall StreetThat sounds very much like the basic design of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, a premium phablet that frequently has been called the best smartphone of 2016.The story fromNikkei'ssource corroborates earlier speculation inMacOS Rumors. In March, the site reported KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo (who has a proven track record in predicting Apple releases) was expectingApple to release a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved AMOLED displayin 2017.Applehaslooked to Samsung for inspiration in the past, most notably with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. After years of resisting the idea of a large smartphone and openlymocking the super-sized phabletcategory that Samsung essentially kicked off with the original Galaxy Note, Apple caved to popular demand in 2014.The iPhone 6 was big, and the new iPhone 6 Plus was bigger than that original Galaxy Note. Of course, this time around, Apple would be copying a little more specifically.Ironically, the only manufacturer currently able to produce large, flexible AMOLED panels in any quantity is Samsung. That would continue the companies' awkward tie as bitter rivals who also are deep in a supplier/customer relationship.An All-New iPhone Would Boost AAPL's Bottom LineAnalysts expect Apple to release a new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Those phones are likely going to be significant upgrades from this year's new iPhone 7 series, including some sort of new look (possible switching from metal to an all-glass case) to help convince consumers to upgrade. They may or may not kickstart the upgrade cycle Apple wants.However, an all-new iPhone model - one with acompletelydifferent design, a superior AMOLED display and the sexy curved screen pioneered by Samsung - would undoubtedly provide a huge sales boost.With the upscale look, Apple would be able to position and price it as a premium smartphone.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Unleashes Major Shakeup at     Apple StoresBased on past history, you can bet hardcore Apple customers will be willing to shell out big bucks to show off the ultimate new iPhone. AAPL might even be able to convince a few Android users to defect from the Galaxy Note 7.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Back to School 2016: The 5 Best Tablet for     StudentsApple Inc.

5 Top Wearables Companies to Watch;8/23/2016;"The market for wearable devices is absolutely on fire.   Case in point, the global wearables market grew 67% during the   first quarter of 2016, according to researcher IDC.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Predictably, tech investors are busy searching for the top   wearables companies to add to their portfolios. So, which   companies are churning out the tech wearables consumers want   the most? Let's quickly review which companies dominate wearable   tech today.The five top wearables companies todayThe names that dominate the wearable device market   probably won't come as a complete surprise to most veteran tech   investors. Atop the list sit names like wearables leaderFitbit(NYSE: FIT) , Chinese smartphone powerXiaomi, tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , outdoor gear leaderGarmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) , and Korean electronics powerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Here's how these names rank in the market for tech   wearables as of Q1 2016.Company NameTickerQ1 '16 Market ShareMarket CapFitBit Inc.NYSE: FIT24.5%$3.2 billionXiaomiprivately held19%$46 billion*Apple Inc.NASDAQ: AAPL7.5%$584 billionGarmin Ltd.NASDAQ: GRMN4.6%$10 billionSamsungNASDAQOTH: SSNLF3.6%$172 billionData sources: Google Finance,The Wall Street Journal, IDC. *Denotes private market valuation.IDC has yet to release its Q2 2016 market share figures,   though it bears noting that the same names have consistently   dominated the wearables market in recent quarters. Case in point,   the same five names all appeared in the top five of IDC's Q4 2015   rankings, though their position on that list did shift slightly.   Similarly, four of the five names above also appeared in IDC's Q3   2015 rankings, with only Samsung failing to gain a place on   the list.New wearables coming before the holidaysAt present, it seems unlikely the names that dominate wearable   tech will change dramatically in the coming quarters. However, a   number of important device releases on the horizon will likely   influence the ongoing horse race for wearables supremacy heading   into and beyond the holiday season.Tech giant Apple is widely expected to debut an updated   version of its eponymous Apple Watch in the coming months.   Depending on the device's actual feature set, the device could   quite conceivably capture a more meaningful portion of the   market. However, current reports paint the forthcoming Apple   Watch 2 as a more incremental improvement over its predecessor,   so such a sequence of events seems a remote possibility   today.At present, limitations on cellular chip power efficiency and   battery capacity will likely hinder Apple from including   full-fledge cellular network connectivity as part of the Apple   Watch 2, though such plans reportedly remain part of the   company's long-term smartwatch strategy. Instead, the Apple Watch   2 will launch with an improved GPS chip and a more concerted   emphasis on health and fitness tracking, potentially leaving an   opening for competitors to steal wearables market share from the   world's largest tech company.In the smartwatch space, Samsung will debut its latest device   -- the Galaxy Gear S3 -- at an event in Berlin at the end of   August. Neither the event invitations themselves nor the   always-humming tech rumor mill offers much in the way of detail   regarding possible features for Samsung's next-generation   smartwatch. However,Image source: Fitbit.Samsung has already pulled ahead of Apple in some senses in   this growing space. Samsung's Galaxy Gear S2 3G, despite being a   real mouthful to say, offers the cellular connectivity Apple   reportedly covets. If Samsung can follow up on its successes with   the second smartwatch suite of products with the Galaxy Gear S3,   Apple could see its market share tumble.Perhaps more even importantly, Fitbit also plans to debut two   updated versions of its flagship trackers prior to the holiday   shopping season. The two devices are follow-ups to Fitbit's   Charge and Flex models and should help the fitness tracking   leader maintain its wearable tech leadership position.To be sure, the entire market for wearable   technology will undergo dramatic shifts as the science that   powers the space evolves in the coming years. However, even as   the competitive balance inevitably changes, tech investors should   expect many of the top wearables companies mentioned above to   remain at the forefront of this budding multibillion-dollar   industry in the years to come.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

Report: 3 Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Models Coming Next Year;8/22/2016;"Image source: Apple.According toNikkei, a generally reliable publication,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't planning to launch just two iPhone models   next year, but three. Nikkei, citing a ""source familiar with   Apple's plans,"" claims that the first two models will come in   familiar form factors: a model with a 4.7-inch display and one   with a 5.5-inch display -- sizes that Apple has been producing   since the late 2014 launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.makeArticleAd();The third model, however, will reportedly feature an OLED   display (a display technology that's superior in many ways to   current LCD technology used in current generation iPhones) that's   at least 5.5-inches large and will be ""bent on the two sides."" In   other words, Apple will be taking a page fromSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) playbook.In fact, according to industry analyst David Hsieh, who is   quoted in the Nikkei report, Samsung will actually be Apple's   ""sole OLED supplier next year.""A three-phone strategy would be quite interestingOne of the constraints that Apple has had to work under is   that it commands the lion's share of the profit in the smartphone   industry and wants to make sure to keep it. This has afforded the   company the freedom to invest heavily in research and   development, but it has tied the company's hands somewhat when it   comes to the iPhone's bill of materials cost.This immense profitability and the desire to stay immensely   profitable has forced Apple to be more judicious about   incorporating new, whiz-bang technologies that add cost and/or   manufacturing complexity. Some of these technologies could   fundamentally improve Apple's competitive positioning and its   users' experience and are worth adding. Others might be viewed as   gimmicky by customers and ultimately wind up just being a cost   burden.Another factor that has kept Apple from adopting some   bleeding-edge technologies has simply been the problem of   availability. Apple sells hundreds of millions of phones each   year. In some cases, it simply isn't worth taking the risk on   technology for which manufacturing yields aren't great or for   which industrywide capacity is fairly limited.By introducing a third, ultra-premium iPhone in 2017 alongside   two more ""mainstream"" iPhones, Apple could pretty much get around   both of these problems. An iPhone with a curved OLED display (as   well as whatever other features Apple would include to justify a   premium price for the product) would undoubtedly be more   expensive to make than an iPhone with a traditional liquid   crystal display.But as long as Apple could  charge customers more for the   model with an OLED display, then the increased cost structure   wouldn't be too much of a problem.Additionally, if the curved OLED model is a limited,   premium-priced device, the fact that Apple has only one source   for these displays wouldn't betoobig of a risk. Once additional suppliers come online with   flexible OLED display capacity (and manufacturing recipes that   can produce product at acceptable yields), then Apple could more   broadly incorporate OLED displays into its iPhone product lineup   -- and beyond.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Ouch! iPhone 6s Crushes New Galaxy Note 7 in App Speed Test;8/22/2016;"Samsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) new flagship Galaxy Note 7 arguably hasApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 6s beat when it comes to hardware specs.   The Galaxy Note 7 boasts a 14-nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820   quad-core 64-bit processor and 4GB of RAM -- not to mention it's   waterproof and can charge wirelessly. But Apple's nearly   one-year-old iPhone still beats -- or, more accurately,crushes-- Samsung's latest and greatest in an app speed test.Galaxy Note 7. Image source: Samsung.makeArticleAd();The Galaxy Note 7's embarrassing speed testSamsung's newest phone's poor performance against the iPhone   6s was demonstrated in an app test by PhoneBuff on YouTube (viaMacRumors).""The iPhone 6s has had itself quite the year when it comes to   speed tests,"" said PhoneBuff's David Rahimi in the video. He went   on to cite the Apple phone's impressive track record at   outperforming many of the world's fastest smartphones. But Rahimi   wanted to see if the Note 7 could ""take back the speed test title   that the Note 5 lost"" or if ""the iPhone 6s [could] pull off what   has never been done here at PhoneBuff, and go undefeated in its   lifecycle.""In PhoneBuff's app speed test, which included a succession of   apps the two phones would have to open and one video to be   rendered, the iPhone 6s achieved ""one of the biggest leads""   Rahimi had ever seen on a speed test at PhoneBuff by the time   there were only a few apps left to open. And after finishing its   first ""lap"" of opening apps, the iPhone 6s proceeded to complete   another lap before the Note 7 even finished its first.As for the Note 7's time during the test, it finished its   first lap in two minutes and four seconds -- or 13 seconds after   the iPhone 6s finished itssecondlap.Specs aren't enoughWhile this does mark the first time a smartphone in   PhoneBuff's app speed tests a smartphone upheld its record during   entire first-year lifecycle, the iPhone's stellar performance   isn't entirely surprising. Thanks to the company's relentless   focus on the user experience, Apple is already known for   separating itself from the pack when it comes to performance in   PCs and laptops -- a lead over competing PC manufacturers that   has actually increased during the past decade. And now Apple's   same approach to tightening integration of design, software, and   hardware seems to be paying off with iPhone.Interestingly, one of the iPhone's advantages stems from a   bold bet the company made years ago to begin developing its own   A-series chips based onARM Holdings-based architecture. Designing its own chips, the move took the   company's vertical integration for iPhone one step further than   its Mac lineup, since Macs still useIntelchips.Apple's increasing investments over the years in its A-series   designs have yielded impressive results, turning the iPhone maker   into a formidable chip designer in its own right -- and helping   iPhone's user experience best competition.With results from this new speed test making rounds just weeks   before Apple launches its latest iPhone, which is rumored to   include an even faster and more efficient A10 processor,   and possibly even more RAM, is iPhone's real-world   performance about to take an unprecedented leap ahead of the   competition?A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple will also throw in a free pair of Beats wireless headphones as part of its back to school 2016 promotion.Now that iOS supports split screen capability and Microsoft Office apps are available with native support, the9.7-inch iPad Prois a top choice for best tablet for students in 2016.Just make sure you spring for the $149 Smart Keyboard for a combination of screen protection and laptop-like typing capability.The 5 Best Tablets for Students: iPad Air 2Source: AppleIf the iPad Pro is a little on the pricey side, Apple is still selling theiPad Air 2.It's not the most powerful tablet on the market these days - it has been nearly two years since Apple updated it after all - but it's still agoodtablet. It has a 9.7-inch Retina display, and it's as thin and light as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.It runs more than one million iOS apps, including Microsoft's mobile Office applications, so finding software shouldn't be an issue. And the iPad Air 2 also gets those free Beats headphones and is eligible for student pricing.Back to School 2016: The 5 Best Laptops for     StudentsDoing the math, the iPad Air 2 is $379 for students, and you get a free pair of Powerbeats 2 Wireless headphones that currently sell for $200. That's a pretty good deal, and you can pick up a third party Bluetooth keyboard cover to complete the package.The 5 Best Tablets for Students: Surface Pro 4If you have the budget,Microsoft's Surface Pro 4is probably the best laptop-replacement tablet on the market, especially if you need to run Windows software.Source: MicrosoftIt's not cheap, though.The base model with anIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) Core m3 CPU starts at $899 and a Type Cover adds another $130. However, Microsoft is currently running a back to school promotion thatknocks up to $300 off a Surface Pro 4purchase.The display is a whopping 12.3-inches, but it looks fantastic and thanks to small bezels and a magnesium alloy case, it still weighs less than most laptops at just 1.69 pounds.Microsoft also includes a touch sensitive Surface Pen, making the Surface Pro 4 a great device for drawing, hand-writing notes or copying diagrams in the classroom.The 5 Best Tablets for Students: Surface 3Source: MicrosoftGiven that Microsoft haskilled the Surface 3 and it seems unlikely to replace it, why would it make any sense to buy one?Sometimes the best tablet isn't necessarily the latest and greatest, especially if you're in a program where you don't need maximum horsepower.TheMicrosoft Surface 3is a nice size for students, with a 10.8-inch display that makes it much more compact than the Surface Pro. In fact, it weighs just 1.37 pounds.It may not have the latest Intel CPUs, but it still packs decent processing power that's more than sufficient for Windows 10, word processing and casual use. Like the Surface Pro, you can buy a Type Cover that turns it into a decent little laptop replacement.Apple Inc. (AAPL): What we Think We Know About     the iPhone 7And with the Surface 3 officially dead, sharp-eyed back to school shoppers should be able to snap one up for considerably less than its $499 MSRP.The 5 Best Tablets for Students: Samsung Galaxy TabPro S 12Source: SamsungThe final entry in this list of back to school best tablet choices is fromSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).The company makes some excellent tablets, notable for their thin design and brilliant AMOLED displays. While most run Android, theGalaxy TabPro S 12is meant to take on the Microsoft Surface Pro.That means it runs Windows 10 and Windows software. Like the Surface (and iPad Pro), there's also a type cover, but instead of charging extra, Samsung includes it with the Galaxy TabPro S 12.It has won a bunch of awards, including a Best of CES 2016 - so any student should be pretty happy with it.Just in time for back to school, Samsung is currently discounting this tablet to $750, which is a decent price considering the beautiful display, Windows 10 support, 128GB of storage and the included, full-sized keyboard cover.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.The postBack to School 2016: The 5 Best Tablets for Studentsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

If NVIDIA Corporation Goes to Samsung, It Won’t Stay Long;8/19/2016;"Image credit: NVIDIA.There has been somespeculationin the press that graphics specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) will start manufacturing some of its chips atSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) at the expense of the company's longtime   manufacturing partner,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) .makeArticleAd();In this column, I'd like to make the case that,even ifthis report is true and TSMC does lose some NVIDIA orders to its   arch-rival, the loss isn't likely to extend beyond a generation   or so. Here's why.What happens beyond the 14/16-nanometer     generation?All of the chips that NVIDIA has announced thus far based on   its Pascal architecture (GP100, GP102, GP104, and GP106) are   built on TSMC's 16-nanometer technology. It's not yet clear where   the upcoming GP107 and GP108 chips -- the two lowest-end products   in the Pascal product stack -- will be manufactured, but if any   Pascal-based chip will be manufactured by Samsung, these are the   two likely candidates.It's widely believed that NVIDIA's next-generation   graphics-processor architecture, known as Volta, will also be   manufactured in a 14/16-nanometer-manufacturing technology. (Fudzillaand awell-known leakeronBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) both say 16-nanometer.)However, as I wrote in a recent article, it appears that,   after the 14/16-nanometer generation, NVIDIA will not use a   10-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology and will, instead,skip directlyto a 7-nanometer technology to build future products.It's worth noting that TSMC is expected to begin mass   production of its 7-nanometer technology in the first half of   2018. If we assume that NVIDIA follows its publicly stated   strategy of using a process after the major mobile players have   built products on it for quite some time, then we could see the   graphics specialist start using this technology in the first half   of 2019.Interestingly, it looks as though Samsung will stay on its   10-nanometer technology for quite a bit longer than TSMC intends   to. In an interview withEETimes, Samsung's Kelvin Low said that a transition to EUV lithography   ""is an important enabler for a 7-nanometer cost affordable node.""   Per the article, he also was ""not ready to announce availability   for 7-nanometer EUV.""My guess, then, is that if Samsung is betting on EUV for its   7-nanometer process, we probably won't see it in mass production   untilmaybe2019, or perhaps even 2020. Further, given NVIDIA's strategy of   not being the first user of a given technology, it would be some   time after Samsung began initial volume production before the   graphics specialist would be likely to use the technology.What's the bottom line?My view is that, even if Samsung wins some NVIDIA business in   the 14/16-nanometer generation (and this certainly remains to be   seen), I don't think the relationship will last beyond a product   cycle or two.TSMC looks as though it will gain a significant technology   lead over Samsung starting in 2018, which should allow it to   reclaim any business that it loses at the 14/16-nanometer   generation. Given the performance-sensitive nature of NVIDIA's   products, it's unlikely that the graphics specialist would use an   inferior technology for the sake of supplier diversification.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Doomed to Underperformance?;8/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is about a month away from launching the iPhone 7, soApple stockhas come into the limelight of late. Wall Street is naturally weighing in, albeit with widely varying views of what the new iPhone portends for the future of Apple and AAPL shares.Source:Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified)First was UBS analystSteven Milunovich, who toldBarron'sthat iPhone growth is ""inevitable"" at some point in the future. Mr. Milunovich reasons that despite an extended iPhone refresh cycle, Apple's huge installed base means that at some point all these people will get tired of their jaded iPhone handsets and start rushing to their nearest Apple store to buy themselves a shiny new thing.makeArticleAd();On the opposite end of the spectrum is Stuart Frankel's Steve Grasso. Herecently spoke on CNBC, where he issued a rather harsh indictment of AAPL, saying the company is doomed to ""underperform perpetually.""Mr. Grasso said Apple stock is no longer a risk asset (assets with high volatility such as growth stocks) and that AAPL has only benefited from everyone getting pushed in the market. Grasso added that he would sell Apple stock on any short-term strength, such as the recent 13% rally after the companydelivered better-than-feared Q3 earnings.In a nutshell, Grasso said Apple's glory days as a growth company are over.7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven't Heard OfThe commentary touched a raw nerve because it came at time when Apple stock had been underperforming, with growth increasingly difficult to come by. Despite recent gains in AAPL stock, it's up a mere 4% year-to-date … and down 6% over the past 52 weeks.Perhaps investors should not dismiss Mr. Grasso as just another soapboaxer who is out to spoil the party. After all, there's a solid chance that the upcoming iPhone might not perform according to heightened expectations.New Growth Runways for Apple StockUnlike the case a few years ago, Apple is no longer the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Smartphone momentum has been gradually shifting from Cupertino to Seoul.Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has grown into a formidable Apple competitor, with the Samsung S7/S7 Edge managing to edge out the iPhone 6s/6s with 16% of U.S. smartphone sales vs. 14.6%. Although Apple loyalty remains quite high, as many as 5% of current iPhone users have indicated their willingness to defect to the Samsung camp when the next upgrade cycle comes calling.But Apple is far from a basket case.The short-term outlook for Apple stock is actuallygood. 2016 is shaping up to be an annus horribilis for Apple investors as iPhone sales are expected to tank in double-digits to below 200 million units, a brutal decline for a device that has managed to post uninterrupted growth for close to a decade.But that kind of drop will inevitably set up easier comps for another year, even two. Indeed, Mr. Milunovich's estimates of modest single-digit growth in iPhone sales in FY 2017 and as much as 20% growth in FY 2018 might actually be in the ballpark - due to abysmal sales in the current year.And some of Apple's revenue segments remain in the pink of health. Apple's Service segment that consists of Apple Music subscriptions, paid apps from App Store, iTunes Music and iCloud storage, among others, has been doing quite well. The segment grew 19% year-over-year last quarter to $5.98 billion, with App Store revenue growing 37%. The segment now contributes a fifth of Apple gross profits, and CEO Tim Cook says the segment could be ""the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year.""Moreover, Apple still has some promising projects in the pipeline, including Apple TV. A streaming Apple TV service has mainly been delayed by Apple using hardball tactics during negotiations with cable content providers as it tries to get more favorable terms. But the company says it's willing to wait and will eventually get its way.7 Stocks the Smart Money Loves … Or HatesFurther, Apple still retains a huge cash hoard that it can use to continue making strategic acquisitions. Indeed, CEO Tim Cook recently told Wall Street that Apple plans to up its M&A game, saying, ""In times when equity values are falling, there's great opportunity to (buy companies).""Is Apple Stock a Growth Play, Or a Value Play?This is, of course, the million-dollar question. Growth stocks tend to receive significantly higher valuation multiples than value stocks. Although Apple is still classified as a growth stock by index providers such as FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones, the fact that Warren Buffet'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and value-oriented mutual fund investors have been piling in suggests that Apple stock is increasingly showing some value characteristics.It might, however, be a year or more before the indices are rebalanced and AAPL is finally designated a value stock.Nevertheless, it's too early to say that this will happen with any degree of certainty. After all, Apple has only recorded declining sales for two quarters, whereas its growth record stretches back much further.Apple stock appears like a good hold over the next two years.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold any positions in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things That Could Take Down Facebook Stock     (FB)3 REIT ETFs to Play ""The Best of All Asset     Classes""The postIs Apple Inc.

What InvenSense's CEO Had to Say About Pokemon Go;8/19/2016;"Image source:Flickr/Shannon.Shares ofInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) shot up around 23% from the close on August 11 to   close on August 15. Shares were spurred by a note from Pacific   Crest analyst John Vinh upgrading the stock on the belief that   the rise in popularity ofPokemon Gowill spur sales of smartphones with high-end gyroscopes in them,   like the ones InvenSense makes.In fact, investors who were paying attention during   InvenSense's earnings call could've gotten that news straight   from the horse's mouth, so to speak. CEO Behrooz Abdi mentioned   the opportunity presented by augmented reality apps and   specifically brought upPokemon Go. That was two weeks before the Pacific Crest note.makeArticleAd();Here's exactly what Abdi had to say about Pokemon Go on   InvenSense's first-quarter earnings call.Pokemon Gois just an exampleDuring his comments, Abdi told analysts ""new applications   prioritizing raw sensor performance"" present a new growth   opportunity for the company. It's not just augmented reality, but   optical image stabilization and indoor navigation apps require   high-end gyroscopes to function as well.Of course, Abdi couldn't resist pointing toPokemon Goas ""a perfect example"":This game has achieved unprecedented viral popularity     worldwide, but there have been numerous reported cases of the     user experience varying widely depending on the presence of the     high-performance gyroscope in the phone.Ultimately, Abdi believesPokemon Gowill lead to ""the emergence of many more augmented reality   applications and games,"" which will enable it to get its products   into more mid-tier and low-tier smartphones.InvenSense has seen this opportunity for a long timeThe ability to penetrate mid-tier and low-tier smartphones has   been part of InvenSense's long-term outlook on the industry for a   long time. Augmented and virtual reality implementations have   been a big part of what was (and still is) expected to drive the   penetration.We didn't necessarily obviously forecast it or predict that     something likePokemon Gowas going to come along, but we always felt that augmented     reality was going to come along at some point. And obviously     the last few weeks have been a frenzy of inbound interest from     the customers. [...] If you have a phone that's even a mid-tier     phone that's not AR compatible, I think you're going to get     some questions from consumers. [...] Which means in that     quarter or little bit later, we should see a really good     traction in terms of designs.In other words, Abdi expects that InvenSense will win more   designs in the current or upcoming quarter for smartphone models   that traditionally didn't have a high-end gyroscope. He expects   the market to expand quickly, and by next year, a lot more phones   could have InvenSense gyros inside.Abdi has long pointed to the big opportunity in mobile.Back in 2014, he was talking about how only one in four mobile phones has a   gyroscope in it, leaving it an opportunity to get its products   into the remaining 1.5 billion phones in the world.The competition is still loomingThe biggest threat to InvenSense is the growing presence ofSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) in the market. STMicro was able to grab the socket inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple Watch even though InvenSense managed to   win the gyroscope in the iPhone 6, which was released just six   months prior.STMicro has been aggressively moving into InvenSense's turf,   producing high-end six-axis sensors to take a larger share of   Apple andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) flagship devices. The competitor took both   the optical image stabilization socket and the standard six-axis   gyro socket in Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.Samsung accounted for less than 10% of InvenSense's revenue   during its fiscal first quarter. A year ago, it accounted for 23%   of revenue. The shift caused Apple's share of InvenSense revenue   to climb to 46% from 38% despite a significant decline in iPhone   sales.The point is, InvenSense hasn't done a great job of defending   its market share, and there's no guarantee the expanding market   will benefit InvenSense much. That's especially true considering   the current strength of STMicro, as well as smaller manufacturers   that may look to cater more toward the mid-tier to low-end price   points necessary to penetrate the rest of the market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Intel Corporation Talks Chip Manufacturing Tech;8/18/2016;"Image source: Intel.At its annual developer forum, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) disclosed quite a lot of information about its   current and future chip manufacturing technologies, something   that was sorely needed after a long stretch of essentially radio   silence.makeArticleAd();There is a lot of ground to cover here as the presentation   that the company gave was packed to the brim with goodies. Let's   get to it.Say hello to 14+One topic that Intel talked about was the development of   ""derivative technologies"" based on current manufacturing   technologies. These derivative technologies, according to Intel,   are ""becoming more common to enhance performance and/or expand   feature set.""The first such derivative technology that Intel is announcing   (or, at the very least, bothering to brand for investors' sake)   is 14+. This is a technology that includes enhancements to both   the transistor as well as the metal stack to yield a performance   improvement of 12%.This process is what the company's upcoming Kaby Lake family   of processors as well as, I assume, the company's second   generation of 14-nanometer server processors slated for launch in   2017, will be built on.Three waves of 10-nanometerIntel says that there will be three waves of its future   10-nanometer technology: 10, 10+, and 10++. These, the company   says, will ""support multiple new leading-edge products.""This means that even though Intel will be ""stuck"" on its   10-nanometer technology for three product generations, the   company should be able to wring out additional   manufacturing-related performance enhancements on top of   product-level architectural improvements.Intel claims significant density advantage over     competitionOne metric that Intel has talked quite a lot about is the   logic area density of its manufacturing technologies relative to   competing technologies fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .The idea is that the more tightly a company can pack   transistors (what chips are made of), the more features and   functionality it can cram into a fixed chip area.Here's the slide that Intel showed comparing its technologies   with those from its competition:Image source: Intel.According to the company, its 14-nanometer technology -- using   the metric of transistor gate pitch multiplied by logic cell   height -- is a little less dense than competitors' upcoming   10-nanometer manufacturing technologies. Intel's own 10-nanometer   technology, per this comparison, will be dramatically ahead of   the competition in this metric (though it's worth noting that   Intel's 10-nanometer technology should come a bit later than the   competitions').Although I believe that Intel will be able to maintain a solid   transistor density lead over Samsung, the competitive picture   vis-à-vis TSMC is a little less clear. Though it is true that   Intel's 10-nanometer should be quite a bit denser than TSMC's   10-nanometer, TSMC has indicated that it will transition to its   7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018.TSMC claims that its 7-nanometer technology will bring both   performance and area enhancements relative to 10-nanometer, so I   expect the gap, at the very least with respect to transistor   area, to narrow relative to Intel's 10-nanometer technology.   Whether TSMC closes the gap or not, remains to be seen.I suspect, though, that any sustained advantage that Intel   will be able to build over TSMC won't necessarily be in terms of   transistor area but, instead, in transistor performance as the   company iterates through its 10, 10+, and 10++ technologies.What does this mean for the business?At the end of the day, it's Intel's job to build compelling   products for the various markets that it serves. Yearly   performance improvements in manufacturing technology should allow   the company to release better and faster products each year,   allowing it to gain share in new areas (such as the Internet of   Things and networking) while defending its position in areas   where it's already strong (personal computers, servers).A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Skip iPhone 7 Pro in 2016;8/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the more intriguing rumors aboutApple Inc.'s(AAPL) coming iPhone 7 launch was the iPhone 7 Pro, but it now appears to be dead. According to Japanese blogMacotakara, Apple has backed away from any plan to release a premium-priced 5.5-inch smartphone, insteadsticking with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plusfor 2016.Source: AppleHow Did the iPhone 7 Pro Rumors Get Started?Two factors have combined to drive the prediction that Apple was at least considering a premium version of its biggest smartphone - the iPhone 7 Pro.makeArticleAd();The first was the appearance of two distinctly different 5.5-inch smartphone shellsshown off in leaked photos. While superficially identical, one sported the typical round camera lens bump found on the iPhone 6 Plus. However, the second has a much wider cutout to accommodate thedual-camera systemthat is widely expected to make an appearance in Apple's 2016 iPhone lineup. It also has what appear to be Smart Connector ports.The second was AAPL's strategy of releasing ""pro"" versions of its products to designate a more capable - and more expensive - version. First there was the MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro. Then last year, in an effort to appeal to professional users and combat sliding iPad revenue, Apple introduced the more expensive iPad Pro.Back to School 2016: The 5 Best Laptops for     StudentsWith iPhone sales also facing downward pressure and the challenge of convincing consumers to buy into an incremental upgrade, the idea of releasing a premium-priced iPhone 7 Pro made sense.The two distinctly different iPhone 7 Plus shell photos fueled speculation that Apple had chosen this approach. The standard iPhone 7 Plus would be the expected incremental refresh, as part of Apple's newthree-year release cycle. It would get the usual upgrades of a faster CPU and tweaked camera and sell for the same $749.However, the iPhone 7 Pro would incorporate the new dual-lens camera system that is expected to offer vastly improved photo capabilities. Smart Connector ports mean it could also plug into accessories like the Smart Keyboard offered for the iPad Pro. And for those big upgrades, consumers would be expected to pay a premium.Is the iPhone 7 Pro Really Dead?Macotakara, citing ""reliable information sources,"" says Apple plans to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this year. No iPhone 7 Pro in the lineup. This is just one Mac rumor site, butMacotakarahas a pretty good track record of calling these things, including getting the early scoop on the names of the iPhone 5c and iPhone SE.Obviously, we won't know who's right until September when AAPL finally reveals the new iPhones. It's entirely possible the photos showing the iPhone 7 Pro are fake, and it's also possible they're prototypes. It's also possible Apple has been hedging its bets, developing multiple iterations of the same basic phone - the latest spy shots of the iPhone 7 Plus show the bigger camera cutout, but no Smart Connector.There's a high degree of certainty that Applewillbe introducing a powerful, dual-lens camera in September. The question is whether that camera shows up in the iPhone 7 Plus, or a new iPhone 7 Pro.For now at least, the smart money is on the iPhone 7 Plus, with plans for an iPhone Pro shelved, at least for 2016.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.

NVIDIA Corporation May Turn to Samsung for Graphics Chip Manufacturing;8/16/2016;"Image source: NVIDIA.Graphics specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)  choseTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing technology
  to build all of the Pascal-architecture graphics processors that
  it has announced so far, which should comprise the bulk of the
  company's multi-billion dollar gaming business over the next
  several quarters. NVIDIA also went to TSMC for its
  next-generation Tegra system-on-a-chip, a central component of
  its small but growing automotive chip business.makeArticleAd();But according toChosun Biz, a South Korean newspaper (viaReuters) NVIDIA will actually tapSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)  to manufacture Pascal-architecture based
  graphics processors before year-end.Though NVIDIA doesn't bring the kind of chip volumes that,
  say, a smartphone processor company does, it's still a key user
  of TSMC's leading-edge manufacturing technologies.Considering that virtually all of NVIDIA's chip shipments
  (both stand-alone graphics processors as well as Tegra
  processors) will eventually move to these product lines, this is
  a pretty big deal for TSMC. And during NVIDIA's earnings
  call in May, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang praised the Taiwan-based contract
  chip manufacturer, calling them the ""world's best manufacturer of
  semiconductors.""So should investors take this news at face value? Let's have a
  closer look.NVIDIA has history with 14-nanometerThere is some evidence in the public domain that NVIDIA is
  looking at a 14-nanometer manufacturing process.The only two viable 14-nanometer processes in the industry
  today belong to Samsung andIntel. However, given Intel's inexperience as a contract chip
  manufacturer (and shoddy track record -- see the significant
  delays Altera has experienced with its Intel 14-nanometer Stratix
  10 FPGA), I doubt that NVIDIA would be looking to build chips at
  Intel anytime soon.So what evidence is there? Well, take a look at thisLinkedInprofile of an NVIDIA senior physical design methodology
  engineer:Image source: Author screenshot of LinkedIn profile.Besides the existing position, there is also a current job
  opening on NVIDIA's website:Image credit: Author screenshot of NVIDIA website.As you can see, both positions specifically distinguish
  between the 14 and 16-nanometer processes as part of the job
  requirements. Since TSMC's technology is known as 16-nanometer
  and Samsung's technology is known as 14-nanometer, my guess is
  the company has actually followed through and developed
  non-trivial chips on both technologies.Will NVIDIA actually make products from its
    14-nanometer efforts?But just because NVIDIA (or really any fabless company) has
  worked on a particular process doesn't mean that the company will
  necessarily bring products built on that process to market. After
  all, if one chip manufacturer's yield rates (that is, the ratio
  of good chips to the total chips produced from a given silicon
  wafer) are weak, or if one company's manufacturing technology
  simply underperforms (i.e., inferior transistor performance,
  power consumption, etc.), a chip designer may choose to only go
  into production with one contract manufacturer, even if it has
  completed the work to build the chip on two companies'
  technologies.The fact that NVIDIA engineers appear to have worked on a
  14-nanometer process tells me that the company may have actually
  designed some products around this process. Given that NVIDIA has
  been pretty open about the fact that the Pascal-based chips
  released so far (GP100 for data centers, GP102/GP104/GP106 for
  gaming) have been built on TSMC's 16-nanometer, it's unlikely we
  will see those products produced at Samsung as well.However, it's possible that the two remaining graphics
  processors that NVIDIA hasn't announced yet (the GP107 for
  low-end gaming and GP108 aimed at PC OEMs) could either be built
  exclusively at Samsung or dual sourced from both Samsung and TSMC
  -- the less risky and more likely option.We'll know soonAnother report from IT Home suggests that the GeForce GTX
  1050, which I would expect to be based on the GP107 graphics
  processor to target budget price points, will hit the market in
  October of this year.If NVIDIA says it is built on 16-nanometer, then that could
  throw the whole idea of dual-sourcing for this product out the
  window. However, if NVIDIA plays coy about the manufacturing
  technology for the 1050 (perhaps by simply referring to it as
  made on a FinFET manufacturing technology), then we'll know that
  it's either a 14-nanometer product -- and NVIDIA doesn't want to
  give the perception that its lower-end graphics processors are
  built on a ""superior"" technology, even though the naming is
  meaningless -- or it is dual-sourced.Regardless, the impact for either TSMC and Samsung in the case
  that NVIDIA dual-sources its upcoming lower-end graphics chips
  (or outright moves that business to Samsung) will be minimal --
  certainly not something that will really have a significant
  financial impact on either chip manufacturing giant.For NVIDIA, the main benefit from moving some business over to
  Samsung would be more favorable pricing. Samsung is the underdog
  in the semiconductor foundry market, so I wouldn't be surprised
  if the company were willing to offer NVIDIA fairly low wafer
  prices. Additionally, if TSMC sees that NVIDIA is serious about
  its multi-sourcing efforts, it may also be driven to lower its
  asking prices in a bid to hold onto the vast majority of NVIDIA's
  business.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Fitbit Stock: Holiday Prospects Look Slim for Fitbit Inc (FIT);8/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAbout a year ago,Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) pulled off a red-hot initial public offering, with FIT stock soaring nearly 50% on its first day on the market. Yet things have certainly been less sanguine since then. Had investors held onto their shares of FIT, the return would have been a horrible 50% loss.Source:Via FitbitThat brings us to the question of whether, despite all this, there is still an opportunity in Fitbit stock or if investors should run toward a more healthy investment.makeArticleAd();Reviewing the FIT Stock RegimenFitbit Inc has shown momentum: In thelatest quarter, revenues soared by 46% to $586.5 million as the company sold 5.7 million devices. The main driver was the strong uptake with two new products, the Fitbit Blaze and Alta (accounting for 54% of revenues).7 Monthly Dividend Stocks With Great YieldsFIT also posted adjusted net income of $51.3 million, even though the company invested heavily in R&D, marketing and sales. Consider that the headcount for R&D spiked by 59% to 863 on a year-over-year basis. Technical talent in Silicon Valley is far from cheap.Although, for investors in Fitbit stock, the biggest piece of good news was theencouraging guidance. The forecast for the current quarter is for revenues of $490 million to $510 million, which compares to the Street consensus of $498.5 million.Now FIT certainly has some strong competitive advantages. After all, the company is the pioneer of the wearables space, having been around for nearly a decade. The result is that FIT has a keen understanding of the market, has built a thriving ecosystem and has a respected brand. Such things are extremely tough to replicate.Yet there are existing mega operators that could ultimately put lots of pressure on Fitbit. Just some of its rivals includeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), as well asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA). These companies are still in the early phases with their wearables, but they certainly have the resources to make a major impact on the market.But there is something else that should cause some worry for holders of Fitbit stock - that is, the lack of clarity on the product road map. For the most part, it appears there will beno new launches in the holiday season- just iterations of existing products. If so, this could mean a flattening in Fitbit's growth rate.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockYet this does not mean you should short FIT stock either! Keep in mind that the valuation is fairly reasonable, with the price-earnings multiple at 31. Oh, and the CEO and CFOdo not plan to sell any stock this year, which shows confidence. And finally, there is periodic talk of a buyout, which does have some credence as AAPL, MSFT and Samsung definitely consider that the wearables market is very strategic.Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (DKS) Earnings Keep     2016's Hot Run AliveBut this does not necessarily imply that Fitbit stock is a good buy right now. Investing in a stock for a potential buyout is always dicey. More importantly, if FIT does not have a new slate of products for the all-important holiday season, there may not be any meaningful catalysts for sustainable gains in the shares.Tom Taulli runs theInvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 7 May Be Completely Waterproof;8/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPundits have assumed for months that whenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) unveils the new iPhone 7 in September, it will offer increased
water resistance. However, a patent filed by Apple and uncovered byPatently Applesuggests the iPhone 7 may go a step further and be completely
waterproof.Source: OptrixApple's patent was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office last week and covers underwater image editing tools for
mobile devices. Specifically, it lets a user edit the tint of
objects and people photographed underwater without affecting the
tint of the water itself. The end result is the photograph is
recognizably snapped underwater.makeArticleAd();So why would this patent covering image editing software be
touching off iPhone 7 rumors?AsQuartz'sMike Murphy points out, if Apple is working on tools to ensure that underwater photos
look great, then it's not a great leap to assume that the photos
would be snapped on an iPhone. And if an iPhone is snapping photos
underwater, it seems reasonable to also assume that AAPL will
be making the iPhone 7 itself waterproof.Twitter Inc (TWTR): Don't Celebrate Apple TV
    Talks YetNot water-resistant. The competingSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy S7 is IP68 rated water-resistant, which is great for
protection from rain and the smartphone can even survive up to 30
minutes in 5 feet of water.You don't spend the time and money to develop specialized image
enhancement software for snapping photos just below the surface of
a swimming pool.Why Apple Needs to Go WaterproofApple needs something to one-up Samsung's phones when the iPhone
7 is launched. Going beyond water resistance to being actually
waterproof would be a marketing coup. It would also end one of the
biggest (and costliest) issues facing current iPhone owners:water damage.Could the iPhone 7 be the device that gets the waterproof
treatment? While the patent was just granted last week, Apple
actually filed in back in 2013. So the company has had plenty of
time to work on the softwareandthe design modifications needed to achieve a waterproof rating.In fact, a waterproof enclosure dovetails nicely with one of the
longest-running iPhone 7 rumors: that Apple is ditching the
headphone jack. The space savings in eliminating this standard port
are minimal, though the headphone jack is one of the primary
ways water can enter the device.Eliminate the headphone jack, and waterproof gets a lot easier
to achieve.Besides having a feature to beat Samsung on when it comes to
marketing, there clearly is consumer demand for a waterproof
iPhone. Dozens of companies make waterproof iPhone cases.
Firms likeOtterboxhave become accessory powerhouses primarily by selling iPhone cases
that protect against water. Offering this as a standard
feature on the iPhone 7 would let all Apple customers enjoy their
phones every day without worrying about bricking them when they get
caught in the rain. The more adventurous could actually take them
underwater - perfect for vacations, and without the bulk and added
expense of a traditional waterproof case.Bottom LineOf course, a patent application - even one that has been granted
- doesn't actually mean AAPL will act on it.The company filed over 2,000 patents in 2014alone, and patents often act as protection against infringement
lawsuits as much as predictors of future products.But a waterproof iPhone 7 doesn't seem like a stretch. The
technology is there, the demand is there and the competition has
been using susceptibility to water damage against the iPhone.The iPhone 7 could well be the point where Apple finally fights
back.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.: iPhone SE Review (AAPL)Apple Inc. (AAPL): What We Think We Know About

Apple Inc. Reportedly Taps Taiwan Semiconductor for S2 Chip Manufacturing;8/9/2016;"Image credit: Apple.It's well known thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) relied on its arch rival,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , to manufacture the processor inside its
  first-generation Apple Watch wearable device. That chip was built
  on a relatively dated 28-nanometer manufacturing technology,
  which, for an extremely power-limited wearable design, led to
  significant limitations in terms of performance.makeArticleAd();According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, via
  Digitimes, , the next-generation Apple Watch -- known as the
  Apple Watch 2 -- as well as a refreshed variant of the
  current-generation Apple Watch will use a new applications
  processor manufactured inTaiwan Semiconductor's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanometer process technology.A win for TSMCTSMC has been talking about a variant of its 16-nanometer
  manufacturing technology known as 16FFC, targeted at low cost and
  low-power applications. This, rather than the higher-performance
  16-nanometer FinFET Plus technology used to manufacture some of
  Apple's A9 processors, is what I'd bet Apple will use for the S2
  processor.Although the market for smartwatches isn't as large as some
  market research firms had predicted it to be by now, oneestimatesays the iDevice maker shipped 12 million Apple Watches in 2015.
  This is a multimillion-unit market, and if TSMC can consistently
  nab the applications processor orders for the Apple Watch, it'll
  represent a nice, though hardly game-changing, piece of
  incremental revenue.And, perhaps more importantly in the fiercely competitive
  semiconductor manufacturing market, it'll mean less money flowing
  into the Samsung foundry's coffers.A win for AppleThe first-generation Apple Watch applications processor was
  quite slow, sporting a single, relatively slow CPU core and a
  fairly dated graphics core from the company's longtime graphics
  processor supplier,Imagination(NASDAQOTH: IGNMF) .By transitioning to a variant of TSMC's 16-nanometer
  technology, Apple should have the transistor and power budgets to
  build a much more powerful applications processor while keeping
  power consumption in check. I expect a move to a faster processor
  core -- though I would be surprised to see Apple adopt multiple
  cores at this stage of the game -- as well as to a beefier, more
  modern graphics processor.In a nutshell, the basic tasks for the next-generation Apple
  Watch -- as well as the refreshed variant of the current one with
  the new processor -- should becomemuchfaster, and developers will have much more freedom to deliver
  exciting new applications.It's the last part that's so importantApple isn't the first company to bring to market a smartwatch,
  but even as a late entrant, it has managed to grow its share of
  the market, which it has dramatically expanded, to north of 50%,
  according to Strategy Analytics.Right now Apple has the distinct advantage of having an
  overwhelmingly dominant market share. High market share means
  developers will be more interested in targeting Apple's platform
  rather than competing platforms. More developer attention means
  more and better software for Apple's platform relative to
  competing platforms, which helps Apple to keep current Apple
  Watch users loyal to the platform and to entice first-time
  smartwatch buyers to hop on to the Apple bandwagon.Also note that the Apple Watch currently requires an iPhone to
  function, so the more that iPhone customers adopt and are
  satisfied with the Apple Watch, the potentially stronger Apple's
  iPhone share position will be.Apple's job now is to keep pushing the watchOS platform by
  both making software development easy and giving developers
  first-rate hardware to target their apps to. The applications
  processor inside the S2 system-in-package should certainly help
  with the latter.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Apple Inc. (AAPL): What We Think We Know About the iPhone 7;8/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIfApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) follows its usual release pattern - and there's no reason to
believe it won't - we should be seeing the iPhone 7 in
September.Source: SunnycThere have been a lot of iPhone 7 rumors floating around over
the past few months, but as the expected launch date approaches and
leaks of cases, components and even complete units have begun to
show up with increasing frequency, we have a pretty good idea of
what Apple has in store.makeArticleAd();Here's a roundup of what we currently think Apple will unveil
when it shows off its latest iPhone in just over a month.Form FactorIt looks as though Apple will be sticking with the same
two-model release strategy it initiated with the iPhone 6 and 6
Plus. There had been talk of a third iPhone 7 Plus ""Pro"" model as
well, but most bets are on a 4.6-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone
7 Plus.7 No-Name Tech Stocks That Will Make You
    RichWith iPhone sales slowing and Apple moving to a three-year model
refresh cycle, this year's smartphones are expected to look very
much like the previous two generations.Leaked photos have shown the antenna band moving to the top and
bottom of the case, the new versions may be slightly thinner and
images have circulated of a darker, near-black color option,
but the iPhone 7 should look very much like the iPhone 6 and
6s.iPhone 7 CameraOne of the big selling points for 2016 is expected to be the
camera, especially the one Apple appears to be sticking in the
iPhone 7 Plus. Buyers who shell out for the more expensive
smartphone are expected to get a dual-lens camera system for
advanced photography.This could include the ability to take much wider angle photos,
or one of the lenses may allow for a two to three times optical
zoom. The dual-lens system can be seen appearing in many iPhone 7
Plus cases, including the ones shown in the photo that arealready being offered for pre-order by China's
Sunnyc.The iPhone 7 itself seems to be getting an upgrade as well, with
spy shots showing a much larger camera lens.Goodbye Headphone JackWhile the iPhone 7 camera is expected to generate upgrade
interest, one factor that could cool consumer demand is the
headphone jack, or lack thereof. Rumors suggest that Apple is
killing the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, instead relying on
its Lightning port for audio output. That means either including
new Lightning ear buds with the phone, or a Lighting to 3.5mm
headphone jack adapter in the box.Lightning ear buds are a more elegant solution, but eliminating
the headphone jack means millions of headphones sold over many
decades are suddenly incompatible with the iPhone 7 - without
an adapter. Including one in the box might quell some complaints,
but there's no doubt many people will be upset with this move.Waterproof and Improved Battery LifeWhy would Apple risk infuriating millions of music lovers by
ditching the long-time industry standard headphone jack?It appears to have fallen victim to several other features,
primarily waterproofing. Apple seems intent on eliminating
every possible water entry point (including the home button whichmaybecome a ""force touch"" virtual version instead of a physical
button) and that 3.5 mm headphone jack is a big entry point. While
rivalSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has offered waterproof smartphones for years, the iPhone 7 would
be an Apple first - and another big reason for current iPhone
owners to upgrade.It's alsopossiblethat the iPhone 7 could feature the recently announcedGorilla Glass 5fromCorning Incorporated(NYSE:GLW). Corning says the new ultra-durable screen protection will be on
devices starting this fall, and given that Apple has used Gorilla
Glass on iPhones in the past (although the relationship is kept
low-key) it's possible the iPhone 7 could be much more rugged
overall than previous Apple phones.Another bonus to eliminating space taken up by that connector is
more room for a battery, and the iPhone 7 is expected to get a bump
in battery life as a result.More StorageBesides lack of waterproofing, another area Apple gets picked on
is its insistence of sticking with 16GB as the base storage for its
phones. That seems like a blatant rip-off these days, especially
when features like 4K video recording generate huge files.TheWall Street Journalsays Apple will finally relent this year and theiPhone 7 will offer 32GB of storage in its base
model. Some analysts expect the company will also boost the maximum
storage from the current 128GB to 256GB, for power users.More PowerfulEvery new generation of Apple devices get a spec bump and the
one thing we can count on this year is that the iPhone 7 will be
powered by a new A10 processor.Expect more speed, and improved efficiency. While the iPhone 7
is expected to remain at 2GB of RAM, processing demands of the dual
camera system of the iPhone 7 Plus could see it get bumped to
3GB.Walmart Flails at the Internet With Jet.com
    BuyNaturally, Apple is mum on all the rumors and speculation, so
we'll have to wait for confirmation on the details. But with
several key upgrades high likely -including waterproofing and a
boosted iPhone 7 camera- the demand for the Apple's new smartphones
may be high enough to shake off itscurrent sales slump.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Apple Inc.: iPhone SE Review (AAPL)Apple Inc. (AAPL): 9.7-inch iPad Pro and Smart

Samsung Gears Up for Apple's iPhone 7 With the Note 7;8/7/2016;"Pop quiz: Do the following quotes refer to smartphone giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) orSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) ?""The Best Smartphone You Can Buy Right Now"" --The Wall Street Journal, March 8, 2016""Head of the Smartphone Class"" --WSJ, Dec. 1, 2015If you're guessing the answer isn't what most might expect,
  you're spot-on. Both quotes refer to South Korean giant Samsung's
  past two editions of its flagship smartphones.Earlier this week, Samsung launched the latest edition of its
  Note smartphone lineup in a likely attempt to extend its momentum
  ahead of what will probably be the year's most highly anticipated
  smartphone launch -- the Apple iPhone 7, expected to roll out in
  mid-September. Let's review whether Samsung's Note 7 seems up to
  the task.makeArticleAd();Note 7: Another great Samsung smartphoneSamsung opted to skip from last year's Note 5 straight
   to the Note 7 this year, probably in a bid to simplify the
  product numbers across its Galaxy and Note high-end handset
  families.In terms of family resemblances go, Samsung's Note 7 is
  something like the fraternal twin of the Galaxy S7 Edge, the
  device that was the subject of one of the introductory quotes. In
  fact, the Note 7 was reportedly built using the same curved
  screen and Edge software that powers the Edge S7.Image source: Samsung.The two devices also share the same 5-megapixel front-facing
  and 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras. The same powerhouseQualcommSnapdragon 820 processor also powers them, though Samsung will
  purportedly use its own Exynos-branded processors in some
  geographies.The Note 7 enjoys a slightly larger screen size over the
  Galaxy S7 Edge -- 5.7 inches, versus 5.5 -- though the difference
  will be negligible to the average user. The Note 7 and Galaxy S7
  also share the same waterproof exterior that Samsung implemented
  to widespread praise.The biggest difference between the two is the Note 7's S-Pen
  stylus. Though it appears to largely share the core functionality
  of the Note 5, the Note 7 does come with a few new tricks,
  including tap magnification and GIF-making capabilities. The Note
  7 also comes with a new Iris scanner that allows users to unlock
  their phones completely hands-free.Price is another key difference. Thanks to some new features
  and the added component cost of the S-Pen, the standard edition
  of the Note 7 retails at $849, whereas the Galaxy S7 starts $100
  cheaper at $749.Overall, the Note appears to be another great iteration of
  Samsung's successful smartphone lineup. So what does this do for
  the competitive balance ahead of Apple's iPhone 7 launch later
  this year?Apple versus SamsungHeading toward the holiday months, Samsung enjoys an edge over
  Apple with its smartphone lineup. The wild card is what surprises
  Apple could have up its sleeve.One downside of Apple's historic size and scale --
  particularly in regard to its iPhone business, its largest
  segment by far -- is that details of its device plans tend to
  leak more easily than in its days as a smaller, nimbler company.
  The consensus so far, bearing in mind that they are just rumors
  at this point, is that Apple's forthcoming iPhone 7 will offer
  only moderate improvements over its predecessor.Should that be the case, Samsung could steal some market share
  from Apple at the high end of the smartphone market. It will bear
  watching to see whether Apple's ironclad ecosystem can help
  insulate it from Samsung's compelling new devices.Apple reportedly has a sweeping iPhone redesign in the works
  for fall 2017, the device's 10th anniversary. Assuming the rumors
  are correct, consumers could opt to wait for this potentially
  game-changing iPhone next year.Either way, the competitive balance in the most profitable
  part of the smartphone market appears tilted in Samsung's favor
  more than at any other time in recent memory. Especially if Apple
  lays an egg with this year's iPhone, the next year will be a
  fascinating one to watch in this important tech market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Better Buy: InvenSense vs. Intel;8/7/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.You probably already knowInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) are very different companies.Intel built its $163 billion company by dominating the PC
  processor business, but infamously missed the mobile
  segment. InvenSense, on the other hand, is worth just $615
  million, and has bet most of its future on the mobile market with
  its microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).makeArticleAd();Intel missed the mobile boom, but InvenSense bet the farm on
  it. And neither of those paths has worked out especially well for
  the companies.But only Intel is bouncing back, while InvenSense has been
  left floundering.Diversification is the keyInvenSense earns 46% of its total revenue from its sales of
  gyroscope sensors it makes forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  (InvenSense doesn't explicitly say Apple is
  its largest customer, but it's a bit of an open secret).When an iPhone user tilts their device to play a game or move
  it to their ear and the display goes dark, that's InvenSense's
  motion-sensing technology at work. InvenSense has made similar
  technology forSamsung's high-end devices as well.InvenSense's sensors are some of the best in the business, but
  both Apple and Samsung have been able to drive down the selling
  prices of those sensors because of their massive
  size. InvenSense gave up some price negotiations in order to
  get its tech in the most popular smartphones in the world. It's
  paid dearly for it.InvenSense has failed to offset pricing pressures with
  significantly more revenue in its other business segments. As a
  result, its revenues have been plummeting. In fiscal Q1
  2017,  InvenSense reported just $60.6 million in revenue --
  a 43% drop year-over-year.It's not as if InvenSense doesn't see the problem. The
  company's managementsaid on the latest earnings callthat it's looking to the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual
  reality headsets, and lower-end smartphones to drive future sales
  of its MEMS.It's already starting to gain traction, too. InvenSense's
  ""other"" revenue segment (which includes IoT) now accounts for 25%
  of the company's total revenue.But InvenSense is still too dependent on Apple, and the
  company can't match Intel's diversification.Once Intel fully realized how big its problem of missing out
  on mobile was, it set a course for the next big thing: the
  Internet of Things. IoT has become one of Intel's biggest
  focuses, and no one can accuse the company of failing to
  deliver.Over the past few years, Intel has either bought or partnered
  with companies that make wearable devices, connected smart
  cities, driverless cars, computer vision, and much more.Just last month, Intel partnered withBMWandMobileyeto create anopen, self-driving car platform for carmakers. The company's Atom and Xeon processors power the technology,
  along with Intel's cloud platform and machine learning
  systems.It's just one example of Intel diversifying away from PCs and
  moving toward the mind-boggling $7 trillion IoT market.It's not that Intel is making all that much from IoT revenue.
  It earned $572 million from the segment in Q2 2016, up just 2%
  year-over-year, and just a drop in the bucket compared to its
  total quarterly revenue of $13.5 billion.But the advantage that Intel has over InvenSense is that it's
  much more diversified across its IoT opportunities. Even its PC
  business (still Intel's biggest money maker) is spread across
  many major customers. InvenSense's fate is essentially tied to
  Apple and little else.This isn't even closeInvenSense's losses mean that the company doesn't have a
  positive P/E ratio right now. Meanwhile, Intel's P/E is just
  under 17, much lower than the technology industry average of 26.
  Intel isn't experiencing skyrocketing earnings right now either,
  but it's at least diversifying itself far more than
  InvenSense.Intel is still working on its transition away from PCs, and
  not everything is going smoothly. For instance, the company just
  recalled its Basis smartwatches because of overheating
  problems.But compared to InvenSense, Intel looks like a no-brainer.
  Intel's revenues aren't dominated by just one major player;
  InvenSense can't say the same. And for that reason, I think Intel
  is a much better buy for investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Customers Aren't Upgrading Their Phones. Should Wireless Carriers Worry?;8/6/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.It's no secret that the smartphone upgrade cycle is getting
  longer. Earlier this year,Citigroupanalysts estimated the smartphone upgrade cycle would extend to
  29 months this year, from a range of 24 to 26 months two years
  ago.The driving force behind the extension is the shift in
  carriers from a subsidy model to equipment installment plans. And
  the move is now starting to cut into carriers' revenues.Verizon(NYSE: VZ) saw its equipment revenue fall 4.1% last quarter,
  leading to its first quarterly revenue decline in over six years.AT&T(NYSE: T) has seen its equipment revenue fall three straight
  quarters as customers hold on to their smartphones longer.makeArticleAd();But while wireless carriers are seeing a decline in revenue in
  part because of declining equipment sales, the lengthening
  smartphone upgrade cycle shouldn't worry investors.It's all about the bottom lineThe margins on smartphone sales are significantly worse than
  on carriers' wireless service. While carriers may receive
  incentives to sell phones from certain hardware makers, the
  devices are generally sold at cost.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) pays salespeople notoriously high commissions,
  which is whysales reps often recommend Samsung devices over
  other manufacturers. Still, those commissions don't amount to much in the grand
  scheme of things, and AT&T's and Verizon's margins on its
  wireless service are much better.That's evidenced in the companies' wireless segment margins.
  Verizon's wireless business saw its operating margin increase 2.9
  percentage points year over year, and its EBITDA margin improved
  3.6 percentage points in the most recent quarter. AT&T's
  consumer mobility segment improved its operating margin a more
  modest 1.5 percentage points, and its EBITDA margin improved 2.2
  percentage points.The shift to separate service and equipment billing has also
  lifted service margin at AT&T. Verizon doesn't break out
  service margin. Both have seen service revenue decline as a
  result of the shift as well.Verizon has managed to continue increasing its operating
  income and EBITDA. The same can't be said of AT&T, but that's
  due more to high-value postpaid phone subscriber losses than to
  an extension of the smartphone upgrade cycle.Verizon will face its first big test this quarterOn Verizon's second-quarter earnings call, CFO Fran Shammo
  told investors he doesn't really know what kind of impact
  equipment installment plans will have on existing customers'
  decisions to upgrade their phones. ""We have our first set of EIP
  customers coming up on their two-year anniversary,"" he told
  analysts. ""And there's not enough volume yet of those customers
  to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they are
  going to hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their
  bill or if they are just waiting for a new phone.""He also noted that the company saw a similar trend in 2014
  ahead ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 6 launch, but it wasn't quite as
  ""dramatic."" There are reports that Apple's upcoming iPhone
  release this fall won't be a major upgrade like the iPhone 6,
  which may cause some iPhone customers to hold on to their devices
  even longer. Apple holds a 43.9% market share in the United
  States, and that percentage is likely even higher for Verizon
  with its premium customer base.For what it's worth, AT&T saw its first round of EIP
  customers finish their first round of installment payments in the
  second quarter last year, when equipment revenue stayed flat. It
  improved marginally in the third quarter before falling nearly
  21% in the fourth quarter. That may be partially due to the tough
  comparable with the iPhone 6 release in 2014, though. Operating
  income continued to increase nonetheless.Investors should look closely at Verizon's results in the
  third quarter. Verizon could report another revenue decline, but
  if it's mostly the result of customers who are holding on to
  their phones longer, it shouldn't be too much of a concern.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

5 Things InvenSense's Management Wants You to Know;8/3/2016;"Image source: InvenSense.Things aren't going so well forInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) . The company's stock isdown more than 30%since the beginning of this year, and its Q1 2017 revenues were
  down 43% year over year.  But the company is still
  bullish on its position in the microelectromechanical systems
  (MEMS) market, and its expansion into the Internet of Things
  (IoT).makeArticleAd();While I don't think InvenSense ison its way to a turnaroundany time soon, the company, on its earnings call last week,
  highlighted a few ways it plans to make its business
  stronger.InvenSense is still betting on its mobile
    positionThere's no positive way to spin InvenSense's falling revenue
  and stock price, but the company believes that its motion sensors
  still give it a strong position in the mobile
  space. InvenSense CEO and President Behrooz Abdi said on the
  call that,[W]e continue to hold a majority position in our addressable
    market. Having successfully brought to market several
    generations of our six-axis motion sensor, we have maintained
    our sole position at our largest customer, and have developed a
    collaborative relationship on high-performance MEMS technology
    that allows us to deliver to their rigorous specification and
    performance goals.InvenSense may be bullish on its mobile position, but it would
  be much better offdiversifying revenue in new markets.Reducing reliance on SamsungInvenSense has relied onAppleandSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for the majority of its revenue for years, but
  its dependence on Samsung has been waning. Samsung stopped using
  InvenSense's sensors in some of its flagship smartphones
  recently, which is both good and bad for the company.The company's CFO and vice president, Mark Dentinger
  wrote, ""We had one customer account for 46% of our total
  revenue this quarter, and there were no other 10%-plus customers
  in Q1.""That reference is to Samsung, which now accounts for less than
  10% of InvenSense's revenue. But investor's should note that the
  company is till vastly overdependent on one customer that
  accounted for 46% of revenue in the quarter. While InvenSense
  doesn't specify who that is, it's widely believed it refers to
  Apple.InvenSense has been expanding its ""other"" revenue segment to
  help offset this, but it's clear that the transition is nowhere
  near complete.Augmented reality could spur MEMS salesThe company said on the earnings call that the popular
  augmented reality (AR) game,Pokemon Go, shows that users are in need of high-quality gyroscopes that
  can track smartphone movements. Abdi said on the call that:This game has achieved unprecedented viral popularity
    worldwide, but there have been numerous reported cases of the
    user experience varying widely depending on the presence of the
    high-performance gyroscope in the phone. Many consumers have
    complained about poor user experiences withPokemon Goon handsets with no gyro, or a sub-standard gyro
    performance.Abdi said the company expects to see many more AR games
  emerge, and that it will expand demand for higher-quality
  gyroscopes in mid- and low-tier smartphones.Internet of Things revenue continues to expandOne bright spot for InvenSense has come from its expansion
  into the Internet of Things, and its continued focus on new
  markets, like sensors for virtual-reality headsets. Abdi said on
  the call that its ""other"" revenue segment, which includes IoT,
  now accounts for 25% of the company's total revenue.""Our strategy for IoT is simply to leverage our technology
  investments in mobile use case, such as image stabilization,
  navigation, and activity recognition to bring industry-leading
  solutions to the many customers who need fast time to market with
  minimal incremental cost."" He went on to say that InvenSense
  just announced a motion-tracking device that's designed to meet
  the ""rigorous performance demands of head-mounted displays.""Abdi pointed to the 50% compounded annual growth rate for VR
  as a way for the company to expand its motion-sensor position in
  new markets beyond mobile.InvenSense wants in on the expanding automotive
    marketInvenSense's management believes there's opportunity for the
  company to sell motion and audio image technology for advanced
  driver-assistance systems (ADAS), which are the building blocks
  for self-driving cars. Last year, the company started a
  partnership with a ""leading sensor and system integration
  partner"" to develop sensors for automotive safety systems.Abdi said on the call that, ""With our partners'
  established automotive channels and in-depth insight into
  automotive qualification, I'm pleased to report that we expect to
  be sampling our first product to automotive OEMs this fiscal
  year."" Abdi went on to say that design wins within the
  automotive market should come within the next six months, and
  expects revenue within a year-and-a-half.This doesn't mean InvenSense is back on the right
    trackI don't think InvenSense is worth the risk right now for
  investors, even with the company making inroads into new markets.
  I've highlighted some of the reasons whyhere.InvenSense's management may be optimistic about the new areas
  the company is expanding into, but investors should remain
  cautious. InvenSense is still far-too reliant on Apple, and its
  new opportunities are all but proven at this point.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Why Reports of a Samsung Deal Sent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Shares Soaring;8/3/2016;"FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne is reportedly on the verge of a deal
  with Samsung Electronics that would put FCA $3 billion closer to
  an important goal. Image source: Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesShares ofFiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) moved sharply higher on Wednesday after BloombergreportedthatSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is in ""advanced talks"" to buy some or all of
  FCA's Magneti Marelli auto parts unit.makeArticleAd();At 1 p.m. EDT, FCA's shares were trading at $6.63, up just
  over 9% from Tuesday's close.What we know about the potential dealFirst, some background. Magneti Marelli is a major supplier of
  automotive parts and components to FCA and other automakers. It
  focuses largely on electronic systems and related parts,
  including lighting, in-car entertainment systems, instrument
  clusters for dashboards, suspension components, and components
  for connected-car systems. Marelli is a wholly owned of FCA, but
  it appears that it's now for sale.According to the Bloomberg report, Samsung is particularly
  interested in Magneti Marelli's lighting, in-car entertainment,
  and ""telematics,"" or connected-car systems. It's possible that
  Samsung will seek to buy only those specific lines of
  business.But Bloomberg's sources, identified only as ""people familiar
  with the matter,"" say that Samsung might be considering an
  outright purchase of Magneti Marelli. Such a deal ""could be worth
  more than $3 billion"" and could close by the end of the year,
  according to the report.What's Magneti Marelli worth?It's hard to say for sure. But we know that Magneti Marelli
  earned 321 million euros before interest and taxes in 2015 on
  revenue of 7.26 billion euros. That works out to an EBIT margin
  of 4.5% -- rather thin, but up from just 3.5% in 2014.A back-of-the-envelope 10-times-EBIT gives us a potential
  value of 3.21 billion euros. That's probably on the rich side,
  but the Bloomberg report suggests that the negotiations are in
  that neighborhood.Why would Fiat Chrysler want to sell?Magneti Marelli's connection to Fiat goes all the way back to
  1919, when the company was founded as a joint venture in which
  Fiat was a partner. But here in 2016, it's easy to see why FCA
  might want to sell: The boss is in a hurry to pay down debt.As of the end of the second quarter, FCA's debt exceeded its
  cash by about 5.5 billion euros. CEO Sergio Marchionne's goal is
  to have FCA's cash exceed its debt by 4 billion euros by the time
  he retires in 2019, likely in hopes of making the company more
  attractive to a potential acquirer.As we've seen, Marelli is profitable, but it's a low-margin
  business. If Marchionne can really get $3 billion or more for it,
  it's a good deal.Why would Samsung want to buy?It's no secret that Samsung would like to diversify away from
  consumer electronics. With the rapid technological changes coming
  to the auto industry, it's a no-brainer that Samsung might want
  to follow the lead of rivals likeLG Chem,Nvidia, andBlackBerry, each of which has established or expanded significant
  automotive lines of business in recent years.Samsung already does business with FCA. Among other things, it
  supplies the batteries for the electric version of the Fiat 500.
  That relationship is expected to expand as FCA adds more electric
  vehicles to its portfolio. Acquiring Magneti Marelli would
  greatly expand Samsung's presence and clout in the auto
  industry.There's also a personal connection. Samsung family heir (and
  vice chairman) Jae Yong Lee is on the board of directors ofExor, a company that serves as the investment vehicle for the
  descendants of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli. There's
  a direct connection to Marchionne: In addition to his duties
  at FCA, Marchionne is vice chairman of Exor.The upshot: The deal makes senseThere's a reason that FCA's shares jumped on the news: At
  anything close to the rumored price, it would be a good deal for
  the automaker. On the other side, acquiring Marelli would
  instantly give giant Samsung a significant presence as a global
  auto supplier, positioning it well to be a player in the
  industry's rapid technological evolution.Long story short: The deal seems to make a lot of sense. We'll
  see if it happens.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

"What to Expect As Universal Display Continues Its ""Year of Building""";8/3/2016;"Image source: Universal Display.Universal Display Corporation(NASDAQ: OLED) is set to release second-quarter 2016 results this
  Thursday after the market close. With shares of the OLED
  specialist up more than 30% year to date and sitting near an
  all-time high as of this writing, now's a great time for
  investors to start thinking about what to expect.makeArticleAd();First, note Universal Display hasn't provided specific
  quarterly financial guidance. So for perspective -- and with the
  caveat that we don't pay much attention to Wall Street's
  short-term demands -- analysts' consensus estimates predict the
  company will report 18.2% year-over-year growth in revenue, to
  $68.7 million, and a 22% increase in earnings per share, to
  $0.50.To be fair, that might seem like a big jump fromlast quarter, when Universal Display saw revenue decline 4.8% year over year
  to $29.7 million, which translated to net income of $1.9 million,
  or $0.04 per share. But keep in mind the second quarter will
  include revenue from Universal Display's long-term license
  agreement withSamsungDisplay, under which it recognizes bi-annual payments received in
  Q2 and Q4 of each year. Together in 2016, those two payments will
  total $75 million, up from $60 million in 2015.To that end, listen for Universal Display to break down itsothersignificant source of revenue in material sales. For example,
  while royalty and license fees outside of the Samsung agreement
  increased 20.5% year over year last quarter, to $5.3 million,
  material sales simultaneously declined 9% year over year, to
  $24.3 million.However, that decline also isn't indicative of a lack of
  demand for Universal Display's OLED materials. During the
  subsequent conference call, management pointed out that material
  buying patterns can vary significantly from quarter to quarter in
  these early stages of growth. And even so, sales of Universal
  Display's patented phosphorescent emitter materials climbed 8%
  year over year. And the decline was primarily due to negligible
  sales during the quarter of host materials, as compared to $4.4
  million in host material revenue in last year's second quarter.
  Remember, unlike its lucrative emitters, UDC customers arenotrequired to purchase host materials from the company since
  they aren't covered under its massive portfolio of over 3,600
  issued and pending OLED-centric patents.To that end, I'll also be listening closely for more details
  surrounding Universal Display's 87 million euro acquisition of
  500 issued and pending OLED patents from BASF, as well as its $36
  million acquisition of contract research organization (CRO)
  Adesis last quarter.I'm particularly curious about the latter. Adesis, according
  to Universal Display, worked closely as a partner in the few
  years prior to the acquisition helping to ""advance and accelerate
  a number of Universal Display's product offerings."" And going
  forward, Adesis' team of 40 chemists will obviously help advance
  its initiatives and widen the company's already formidable IP
  moat.But as Ipointed outa little over a month ago, Adesis also served multiple
  other end markets including pharma, biotech, and catalysis, and
  reportedly generated annual revenue in the tens of millions last
  year. Moreover, Adesis president Andrew Cottone indicated that,
  in addition to supporting Universal Display's OLED ambitions, his
  company anticipates benefiting from Universal Display's
  ""financial and business acumen to better support our clients
  [...] and reinforce our positioning for continued growth as a
  specialty chemical CRO.""It will be interesting to see, then, what kind of incremental
  financial contribution Adesis is expected to provide from these
  supplemental markets as it operates as a subsidiary of Universal
  Display.Next, keep your ears open for updates on royalties paid by
  Universal Display's second-largest customer,LG Display(NYSE: LPL) . Recall that LG Display pays running royalties on
  sales of licensed products with a one-quarter lag. So, I was
  somewhat surprised last quarter by the lack of a significant step
  up in licensing and royalty revenue considering LG Display
  previously confirmed that roughly 50% of its OLED TV unit
  shipments last year were sold in the fourth quarter. However,
  during the Q&A portion of last quarter's conference call,
  Universal Display CFO Sid Rosenblatt indicated those reported
  sales are from products LG display sells toLG Electronics, which means royalties may be paid with ""different timing than
  when LG Electronics reports their sale.""In any case, royalties from LG Display should continue to
  increase as the company ramps production of OLED TVs going
  forward (from 400,000 units shipped last year to a target of one
  million in 2016). But even in these early stages, it would be
  nice to get a better picture of LG Display's financial
  contribution to Universal Display's top and bottom lines.Next, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the big catalyst so
  many credit for Universal Display's recent gains:Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Namely, the increasing number of reports
  indicating Apple is planning to expand its use of OLED from
  ""just"" the Apple Watch to its other iDevices, starting with its
  iPhones. That's not to say I expect Universal Display to directly
  confirm this transition, but considering Rosenblatt himselfcaused Universal Display shares to riselate last year after asserting he thinks it's ""only a matter of
  time"" before Apple puts OLED into its iPhones, you won't find
  OLED investors complaining if he inadvertently drops hints about
  Cupertino's plans.Finally, listen for any changes to Universal Display's
  full-year guidance, which currently calls for 2016 revenue growth
  of 15%, plus or minus 5%, equating to a range of $208.7 million
  to $230.6 million. Again, we're still in the early innings of
  growth for the OLED industry, and Rosenblatt last quarter
  reminded investors that they ""expect 2016 to be a year of
  building"" as various OEMs invest billions to bolster their OLED
  manufacturing capabilities. Still, given the short-term-oriented
  nature of our market, any changes to Universal Display's guidance
  this year could influence the direction of its stock as impatient
  investors wait for that growth story to unfold.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,
    but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:

Samsung Leapfrogs over GoPro Inc. in the VR Camera Race;8/3/2016;"GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) CEO Nick Woodman believes virtual reality is a
  huge growth opportunity for his company. During a conference call
  in May, Woodman claimed GoPro had  ""an opportunity to be a
  leader in consumer VR"" while discussing the company's VR
  filmmaking rigs and VR app.Woodman declared that by combining the six-camera Omni,
  16-camera Odyssey, and Kolor, the company's stitching software,
  GoPro had ""created one of the world's most comprehensive
  platforms for capturing, stitching, sharing and enjoying VR
  content."" Unfortunately, that platform is also extremely
  expensive -- the Omni costs  $5,000 and the Odyssey costs
  $15,000. Woodman mentioned developing a ""more casual"" spherical
  camera for mainstream consumersback in January, but the company hasn't revealed such a device yet.makeArticleAd();Enter Samsung's Gear 360. Image source: Samsung.That's whereSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) comes in. The company's new  Gear 360
  camera is a spherical device that weighs about the same as
  GoPro's Hero 4 Black, but uses two ultrawide fisheye lenses to
  capture 360-degree images and videos. It's an elegant solution
  which makes GoPro's pricey rigs look clumsy and outdated. The
  Gear 360 costs just $350, which makes it $150 cheaper than the
  Hero 4 Black.However, the Gear 360 only works with Samsung phones, and its
  video quality obviously can't match the professional grade video
  of GoPro's multi-camera rigs. But if GoPro still plans to launch
  a ""casual"" spherical camera for the masses, Samsung might have
  raised the bar well beyond GoPro's reach.The business of 360-degree camerasSamsung isn't the first company to launch a 360-degree camera.
  Other notable devices include the Kodak PixPro SP360 4K Action
  Cam ($450), 360Fly ($400), and the Ricoh Theta S ($350). The
  360-degree videos from these devices can be viewed onAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube or inside a VR
  headset.GoPro and YouTube previously co-developed the Odyssey for the
  Jump platform, which delivers professional quality 360-degree
  videos to YouTube. GoPro often cited that partnership as proof
  that it would become a major player in the VR market. However,
  YouTube also recently extendedthat partnershiptoYi Technology, which sells cameras with the same technology as GoPro's
  high-end devices for about half the price.GoPro's Omni (L) and Odyssey (R) rigs. Image source:
  GoPro.YouTube's embrace of cheaper 360-degree and action camera rigs
  indicates that it wants mainstream users to upload more VR videos
  to the site. That would make YouTube a top site for VR videos,
  and widen its moat againstFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB)  News Feed videos and Oculus VR.Why hasn't GoPro launched a spherical camera?YouTube's strategy conflicts with GoPro's strategy of using
  Omni and Odyssey to sell more cameras. GoPro realized that
  YouTube's embrace of cheaper VR cameras could dilute its brand
  appeal, so it launched its own VR site and app, GoPro VR, in
  April. But as I mentioned in aprevious article, that strategy didn't make sense, since more streaming video
  viewers likely start on YouTube instead of GoPro's website or
  app.The key problem with GoPro's strategies is that they all
  revolve around selling more action cameras. Its VR rigs are
  really just accessories, and the Karma drone will likely be aflying accessoryto move more GoPro cameras. That's probably why GoPro has been
  reluctant to launch a spherical device like the Gear 360 -- it
  would likely cannibalize sales of its action cameras and
  rigs.The flaw in that strategy is that companies are integrating
  cameras into these products at lower price tags. Samsung's Gear
  360 and Xiaomi's4K Mi Droneare both cheaper than the Hero 4 Black, which raises questions
  about why consumers would buy GoPro's action cameras and VR/drone
  accessories separately for higher prices. Unless GoPro abandons
  its accessory strategy and focuses on creating competitive
  stand-alone devices with integrated cameras, it will likely

Cypress Semiconductor Expands Its Scope, Delivers As Promised;8/2/2016;"Cypress' new CYLKIT-E02 solar-powered BLE sensor beacon
  reference design Kit. Image source: Cypress Semiconductor.Cypress Semiconductor Corporation(NASDAQ: CY) released second-quarter 2016 results late last week.
  And -- similar to last quarter -- though shares of the
  semiconductor specialist initially jumped more than 8% on the
  report, they once again settled to close to roughly even on the
  day. To understand why, let's put Cypress Semiconductor's latest
  quarter under the microscope.makeArticleAd();Cypress Semiconductor results: The raw numbersMetricQ2 2016 ActualsQ2 2015 ActualsGrowth (YOY)Adjusted revenue*$456.4 million$491.0 million(7%)Adjusted net income$40.2 million$52.9(24%)Adjusted EPS$0.12$0.15(20%)*Adjusted (non-GAAP) revenue includes $6.25 million in revenue
  from intellectual property licensed toSamsung, which was excluded from GAAP revenue because of purchase
  accounting for the Spansion merger. YOY: year over year. Data
  source: Cypress Semiconductor.What happened with Cypress this quarter?These results were in line with guidance providedlast quarter, which called for adjusted revenue of $440 million to $470
    million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 to
    $0.14.Revenue climbed 7% sequentially from last quarter on
    typical seasonality. Adjusted earnings per share rose 71.4%
    sequentially.Based on generally accepted accounting principles, Cypress
    turned in a net loss of $519.3 million, primarily because of a
    non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $488.5 million related
    to its Programmable Systems Division. This charge resulted from
    decreases in forecasted operating results compared with
    expectations for the division at the time of the merger,
    primarily in consumer markets as Cypress increased its focus on
    automotive and industrial segments.Management was careful to point out that the charge has
      no effect on Cypress' cash balance or operating cash flow,
      and its long-term outlook for revenue and earnings remains
      unchanged.Gross margin continued to expand per Cypress' gross margin
    improvement plan, climbing 90 basis points sequentially, to
    37.8%. Excluding Cypress' emerging-tech division, core margins
    were 38.1%, as Cypress continued to maintain low factory
    utilization as part of its lean inventory initiatives.Inventory at the end of the quarter was $220.9 million,
    down 26.6% year over year.Cypress Semi has realized $165.5 million in annualized
    synergies from itsmerger with Spansionin last year's second quarter, up from $150.4 million in Q1.
    Cypress remains well ahead of its plan to achieve $180 million
    in synergies by the end of 2016.Adjusted revenue by business segment broke down as
    follows:Programmable systems grew 2% sequentially, $166.8
      million.Memory products climbed 14% sequentially, to $244.4
      million.Emerging technologies declined 24% sequentially, to $19.7
      million.Data communications increased 27 sequentially, to $25.5
      million.Adjusted revenue by geography broke down as follows:Japan represented 20% of total sales, down from 27% last
      quarter.Europe represented 15% of sales, flat with last
      quarter.Americas represented 13% of sales, down from 14% last
      quarter.The China/rest-of-world division represented 52% of
      sales, up from 44% last quarter.The company repurchased a negligible number of shares in
    Q2. Cypress has used $239 million of the $415 million
    repurchase authorization it approved in the fourth quarter of
    2015.Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Cypress closed on its
    $550 million acquisition ofBroadcom's wireless Internet of Things (IoT) business.Through the acquisition, Cypress now offers
      state-of-the-art Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee IoT product
      lines, as well as supporting intellectual property and the
      WICED brand SDK, developer ecosystem, and community.What management had to sayThad Trent, Cypress CFO and member of the office of CEO,
  added:The acquisition of Broadcom's wireless IoT business marks
    another key milestone in Cypress's evolution and underscores
    our strategy to invest in high-growth markets. In the third
    quarter, we expect more than half our revenue will come from
    markets growing faster than the overall semiconductor
    industry. The expansion of Cypress' leadership position in
    embedded systems will accelerate our progress toward our target
    financial model. Best-in-class wireless technology from
    Broadcom -- combined with our standard and programmable
    microcontrollers, analog ICs and USB connectivity solutions --
    provides Cypress with a stake in some of the most exciting
    innovations in the automotive, industrial, and IoT markets.Looking forwardFor the third quarter, Cypress expects adjusted net sales
  in the range of $510 million to $540 million, up from $470.1
  million in the same year-ago period, reflecting its base business
  growing on a seasonal basis and including $55 million to $60
  million in revenue from the Broadcom IoT business acquisition.
  That should translate to adjusted earnings per diluted share
  of $0.12 to $0.162, down from earnings of $0.17 per
  share in last year's third quarter.As it stands, this was a solid report from Cypress with no big
  surprises, as the company continues to position itself to
  capitalize on higher-growth markets going forward. So while it's
  no surprise that shares are little changed following this
  performance, long-term investors should be more than pleased with
  where Cypress Semiconductor stands today.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Tablet Sales Continue to Slide — What Are Investors to Do?;8/2/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet again tablet sales took a hit in the second quarter. Global
shipments plunged by 12.3% to 38.7 million, according to a report
fromInternational Data Corporation (IDC).Source: AppleSo what's going on here? And what does the deterioration in
tablet sales mean for investors?makeArticleAd();First of all, let's take a deeper look at the IDC report.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the leader, with10 million shipments in Q2. This should be no surprise since the company is the innovator in
the category. Back in early 2010, AAPL launched the iPad, which was
a huge hit. It certainly helped that the company leveraged the
thriving ecosystem of developers and apps of the iOS platform.Unfortunately, keeping up the momentum has been tough
going. In the latest quarter, iPad shipments fell by 9.2%.10 Market Predictions for the Rest of 2016But this was actually pretty good compared to the awful
performance ofSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). The company suffered a 24.5% drop to 6 million units.Yet there were still some silver linings with tablet sales.Lenovoposted a 3.1% increase andHauwei's shipments jumped by a hefty 71%. For the most part, it looks
like the Asian market continues to provide growth
opportunities.But perhaps the biggest standout wasAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). The company took the No. 5 market share slot because of a
blistering1,209% surge in shipments. As should be no surprise, the AMZN low-cost strategy continues to
gain traction - and there was definitely a nice boost from
Prime Day.Bottom Line on Tablet SalesThe IDC report points out some important factors impacting
tablet sales. One is that the consumer segment appears to have
stalled. Let's face it, there are many smartphones that have larger
form factors, such as phablets. And besides, there may not be as
much incentive for people to upgrade tablets. Hey, how many
must-have features do new devices really have? Well,
not many.Something else: IDC shows that there is a growth opportunity in
the detachables segment. While still small, there could be a nice
long-term impact on tablet sales.A detachable is a combo of a tablet and laptop, and for the
most part, these devices are attractive products for professionals,
especially those who travel a lot. Because of this, IDC believes
thatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) could be poised for a nice boost with its Surface
offering.After all,Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system has lagged with multitasking
capabilities for detachables. In other words, there could be an
opening for rivals.Now, the dynamics of tablet sales is not necessarily a good
gauge for picking stocks. All in all, the major players in the
market have massive diversified revenue streams.AAPL Stock Needs More Than iPhone Sales for
    Long-Term SurvivalRather, the importance of tablets is the power of synergy. For
example, in the case of AMZN, the company can cross-sell its
ecommerce offerings. As CEO Jeff Bezossaid a few years ago: ""We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they
buy our devices.""However, it seems that the tablet market may have matured - and
will not ultimately achieve the tremendous ubiquity of
smartphones.Tom Taulli runs theInvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook. He is also the author ofHigh-Profit IPO

Apple Found Success With the iPhone SE;8/2/2016;"Image source: Apple.Ever sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) launched the iPhone SE in March, the 4-inch
  smartphone has been the center of a lot of questions. Would it
  boost iPhone sales? Would it cut into sales of higher-priced
  iPhone units? Would it convert Android users?With Apple's fiscal third-quarter earnings release in late
  July we got some answers. Despite data suggesting that the iPhone
  SE is cannibalizing the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in the U.S. and
  isn't producing many Android switchers, Apple suggests the global
  story is different. Additionally, it appears the smaller form
  factor helped Apple sell more iPhones than analysts had
  expected.makeArticleAd();Apple sold 40.4 million iPhone units last quarter, versus
  analyst estimates of 39.9 million units. The average unit price
  fell to $595, down from $660 in the third quarter last year and
  below the consensus estimate of $612. That indicates that the
  iPhone SE is a success.Said CEO Tim Cook in the company's conference call: ""At its
  launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone
  lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of
  customers who love a 4-inch phone and to attract even more
  customers into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategy is
  working.""What is a success for the iPhone SE?The iPhone SE fills a hole in Apple's product lineup on the
  low end -- that is, Apple's low end. It's priced lower than Apple
  had been pricing its 2-year-old model, but it brings the
  capabilities of the iPhone 6s, which play toward Apple's service
  business (e.g. Apple Pay). Ultimately, the iPhone SE is about
  bringing more customers into Apple's ecosystem and feeding its
  services business. Doing that would qualify it as a success.Said Apple CFO Luca Maestri in the conference call: ""... we
  believe that the SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which
  is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which
  is obviously very important to us as we bring new people into the
  iOS ecosystem.""The iPhone SE was also intended to open the wallets of
  existing Apple customers who hadn't upgraded their devices in
  over two years, so that they could more easily access Apple's
  newest services. That appears to have happened, according to a
  recentCIRP survey. The research firm found that 33% of iPhone SE buyers were
  upgrading from an older iPhone, including some models dating back
  to 2011 and earlier. That compares with just 17% of purchasers of
  the newest models and 12% of buyers of last year's iPhones. Cook
  told investors on the earnings call that the new model is
  ""convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form
  factor but wanted to stay with iPhone.""Furthermore, it provides a better entry point for first-time
  smartphone buyers. Indeed, the CIRP survey indicates a
  significantly larger percentage of iPhone SE buyers were
  first-time smartphone owners. That was sentiment was perhaps
  echoed in Cook's prepared comments on the earnings call: ""We
  added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June
  quarter.""Finally, the iPhone SE is priced to attract customers looking
  for a phone priced in the midrange, between $200 and $500.
  Previously, those customers could either buy a 2-year-old iPhone
  or an Android model. Most opted for the latter. So a high switch
  rate would indicate that the iPhone SE is succeeding.The CIRP survey indicates a smaller percentage of iPhone SE
  customers were switching from Android compared with the
  larger-screen models in the United States. On the earnings call,
  Cook noted that ""the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to
  customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the
  first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the
  last several years."" While that includes first-time smartphone
  buyers, Cook added that ""switchers accounted for the highest
  percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured.""What about cannibalization?The biggest concern for investors is that the iPhone SE is too
  good -- that customers who might have bought a higher-priced
  iPhone will opt for the low-end SE. That's what the CIRP survey
  suggests, however, Maestri told analysts, ""We have not seen clear
  evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6s or 6s Plus."" But then
  he qualified that statement: ""Of course, there's always going to
  be some level of cannibalization, but really to us what is much
  more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people
  into the iOS ecosystem.""Do you thinkSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) worries about whether its lower-end
  smartphones are cutting into sales of its flagship Galaxy
  devices? No. It's trying to figure out how much it will cut into
  sales of Apple's flagship devices. That's how it manages to
  maintain its global market share lead.The opportunity with the iPhone SE is to take share from
  Android and allow Apple's services business to continue growing
  at a steady clip. Last quarter, services revenue grew 19%.So while it might cannibalize a few sales of the higher-priced
  flagship model, that's offset by the additional iPhone unit sales
  and services revenue.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

3 Reasons the Virtual Reality Revolution Might Be Delayed;8/1/2016;"Image source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Virtual reality headsets fromHTC(NASDAQOTH: HTCXF) andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB)  have been available for several months now.
  Unfortunately, the latest data suggests that neither
  HTC's Vive nor Facebook's Rift will match 2016 sales
  estimates. Here are three possible reasons for the disappointing
  reception.The price problemHigh prices are the biggest barrier to VR adoption -- the Vive
  sells for $799, while the Oculus Rift is priced at $599.Sony(NYSE: SNE)  will debut its PlayStation VR headset this
  October at $399, representing a lower-cost option for those with
  a PlayStation 4 console. But for those who do not already own a
  PS4, that still puts the price north of $700.Alternatively, theSamsungGear VR, which runs on the Oculus platform, has a $99 price tag,
  presenting a relatively low entry cost for people with newer
  phones. As with other low-cost headset options, however, it isn't
  compatible with many games and apps due to hardware
  limitations.Must-have software isn't there yetThe VR game and app ecosystem lacks fleshed out experiences
  and anything that could be described as a ""killer app."" Potential
  uses for virtual reality extend beyond video games, but
  interactive entertainment is the main hook for early adopters,
  and most of the early software has more in common with tech demos
  than triple-A titles.Small user bases for VR platforms mean that developers have
  less incentive to create the types of big-budget experiences that
  might be the key to selling this medium. Developers also have to
  contend with the fact that virtual reality is not standardized,
  with significant differences between platforms potentially
  shrinking addressable markets or limiting design.Rendering virtual reality worlds is also resource intensive
  and requires some trade-offs to deliver immersion. At least part
  of the reason for this is that the number of frames rendered per
  second has to be very high to create a seamless experience;
  oscillations in frame rate, as well as other visual quirks, can
  be disorienting for the user. The substantial processing power
  devoted to running in VR limits overall graphical fidelity, so
  while experiences are more immersive, they also take backwards
  steps in some aspects.Augmented reality is stealing the spotlightWith Facebook, HTC, Sony, and others bringing VR headsets to
  market in 2016, it's surprising to see augmented reality off to a
  much bigger start this year thanks toNintendo's massively popularPokemon Go. The game's incredible success is likely sending developers
  scrambling to get in on what could be the next big thing, and the
  AR push could divert attention and development resources away
  from VR.While virtual reality offers new avenues for data collection
  and ad delivery, augmented reality likely has even greater data
  gathering potential, as well as a profound ability to direct foot
  traffic to commerce centers. With both technologies still in
  their early stages, AR seems to offer a real world social
  component that's a better fit with the current mobile-centric
  software market. Virtual reality has greater immersive potential,
  but it also brings an element of isolation, and the medium
  currently lacks a breakthrough game or app to get people hooked
  and invested in the technology.At least in the short term, augmented reality seems to have
  captured the public imagination and interest in a way that VR has
  not -- and price, sociability, and the presence of a killer app
  seem to be core aspects of that progression.VR should take hold with timeThe combined factors of price, hardware and software
  limitations, and the emergent popularity of augmented reality
  present inhibiting factors for early VR adoption, but the
  technology will improve and its potential better realized with
  time.Major advancements for the tech and its software ecosystem
  will likely play out over the next five-year period and should
  reduce many of the existing barriers to widespread
  adoption. Once the technology and software availability
  improve and prices begin to drop, VR has a strong chance of
  taking off.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

These 2 Smartphone Companies Could Be About to Call It Quits;8/1/2016;"Getty Images.In what seemed impossible a few years ago, it now appears that
  the smartphone industry has met its maturity moment. The
  smartphone industry is rapidly cooling. IDC now expects worldwide
  smartphone shipment growth to slow to 3.1% this year, down from
  the torrid 27.8% growth rate the industry produced in 2014.makeArticleAd();Smartphone giantApplehas now reported its second-consecutive quarter of year-on-year
  iPhone shipment declines. Leading Android handset makerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) has produced erratic performance as it
  attempts to compete with Apple in the high-end markets, and other
  Android makers in the lower-cost developed markets.A hallmark of a mature and declining market is the shakeout,
  where weaker participants leave the industry. IfMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) andSony(NYSE: SNE) are any indication, the smartphone industry may be in
  the initial phases of a shakeout.Smartphones are no longer a point of emphasis for SonyTech websiteThe Vergereports how quickly Sony has pivoted away from smartphones. In
  Sony's recently reported first fiscal quarter, the company
  reported a slim profit in smartphones of $4 million versus losses
  in prior quarters. However, Sony accomplished this rare profit
  not by selling more phones; it was mostly accomplished on cost
  cuts in the division.The Verge notes the company only sold 3.1 million smartphones
  in the quarter versus 7.2 million in the comparable quarter. As a
  result, mobile-division revenue dropped 34%. In fiscal 2016, the
  company expects to sell only 19 million handsets, and appears to
  be positioning itself to no longer grow market share in
  smartphones, but merely to service existing demand.Microsoft continues to cut from its Nokia DivisionNew Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella continues to dismantle former
  CEO Steve Ballmer's decision to buyNokia's smartphone business. Last year, the company took a $7.5
  billion writedown -- essentially the entire purchase price
  -- and announced 7,800 job cuts, most in the mobile business.Then in May, the company took further steps away from phone
  manufacturing. First, Microsoft later agreed to sell its
  feature-phone (read: non-smartphone) business, including 4,500
  employees, to Foxconn, for $350 million. A week later, the
  company announced approximately 1,850 job cuts, most related to
  the smartphone business.It appears that Nadella wasn't finished cutting employees from
  Microsoft's payroll. A new report from Bloomberg states Microsoft
  is eliminating an additional 2,850 jobs in fiscal 2017. Between
  these aforementioned transactions, the company will have shed
  nearly 17,000 employees, or nearly 70% of the 25,000 it gained
  through the Nokia purchase. The vast majority of these employees
  were in its mobile division.It's important to note that both Microsoft and Sony are still
  technically in the smartphone business. However, their actions
  are more in line with companies looking to exit the industry
  versus companies looking to compete and expand their market
  share.A mixed bag for Apple and SamsungFor market leaders Apple and Samsung, a mature, slowing market
  is sort of a mixed bag. As seen above, a slowing market tends to
  depress competition as companies exit the business altogether, or
  stop actively investing in research and development. These two
  factors allow stronger companies to consolidate remaining market
  demand while potentially spending less themselves on research and
  development.On the other hand, slowing demand in a mature industry
  requires increased market share in order to continue growing at a
  level investors are accustomed to. If IDC is right, a 3.1%
  shipment increase will require price increases, or increased
  market share, for substantive smartphone-revenue growth for Apple
  and Samsung.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple May Be Able to Open Stores in India After All;7/31/2016;"Image Source: AppleIndia's government andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have had an on-again, off-again relationship
  recently. After CEO Tim Cook visited the country in May, the
  Foreign Investment Promotion Board ruled that Apple doesn't
  qualify for exemption from the 30% local sourcing rule for
  ""cutting-edge technology"" companies that want to open
  single-brand retail stores in the country.But last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet
  reportedly approved a three-year exemption on the local sourcing
  requirements for companies wanting to open single-brand retail
  locations that sell ""cutting-edge technology,"" according toBloomberg. At the same time, the plan is to make it easier for companies
  like Apple to qualify for the exemption.makeArticleAd();The news that the cabinet is on board with this loosening of
  rules opens the door for Apple to open up stores in one of the
  last remaining major growth opportunities for its iPhone
  line.Getting its own placeApple is currently required to sell its products in India
  through re-sellers and in its store-within-a-store locations.
  Those formats prevent Apple from controlling the retail
  experience the way it does with its stores in other
  countries.Apple's stores are a key part of the company's overall
  strategy. Not only do they extend and advertise the Apple brand,
  but the locations provide a customer-service center for Apple
  device owners. Apple Store employees are qualified to answer
  customer questions and help fix issues with devices. While
  re-sellers can provide advice as well, Apple Store employees
  undergo extensive training to help customers get the most out of
  their devices (and upsell customers to more expensive devices
  while they're at it).Additionally, opening up its own retail locations could allow
  Apple to offer a financing plan as it does in the United States
  with the iPhone Upgrade program. That would make it easier for
  Indian consumers to afford the premium-priced iPhones. Even the
  new low-priced iPhone SE costs approximately $584 in India
  because of tariffs and other taxes.The majority of smartphones sold in India cost less than $120,
  with the average sales price just $70, according to research fromGartner. With Apple's least expensive model significantly more costly,
  providing a superior customer experience through its own retail

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Qualcomm, Inc.;7/30/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) tend to appeal to similar sets of investors. Both
  microchip specialists tap directly into the mobile computing
  market, and their products are often found side by side in the
  same electronic gadgets.makeArticleAd();But those similarities are only skin deep. Dig a little bit
  deeper, and you'll find that the companies actually serve very
  distinct end-user markets, and the business models could hardly
  be more different. In the end, investors who like one of these
  stocks probably aren't interested in the other one at all.Here's what I mean.Target marketsMicron works in one clearly defined sector. The company makes
  memory chips of various types, and its products can be found in
  everything from smartphones and tablets to PC systems and
  big-iron servers.Where there's computing power, you'll find memory chips.
  Micron is part of an exclusive group of elite suppliers, where
  only three companies can claim more than 15% of the global DRAM
  chip market. The company holds substantial pricing power thanks
  to this unbalanced market structure.Qualcomm runs a very different ship. The company focuses on
  high-speed wireless communications tools. 64% of last year's
  sales came from CDMA and LTE chip sales, and the rest from
  licensing agreements around Qualcomm's massive war chest of
  wireless technology patents. We're talking about a leader in its
  chosen field, as Qualcomm holds a dominant 65% global market
  share in LTE baseband products, but the company's own clients
  have started whipping up their own wireless solutions.That's just scratching the surface of the deep separation
  between Qualcomm and Micron. Micron runs its own
  chip-manufacturing factories, whereas Qualcomm relies on
  third-party chip foundries instead. Qualcomm's financial health
  follows the fairly calm swings of the global market for wireless
  connectivity, while Micron's sales curve sometimes gets caught in
  price wars withSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . If you're into chart analysis, these two
  companies look nothing alike:MUdata byYCharts.By the numbersBy most metrics, Qualcomm will look like a superior investment
  to the casual observer.Qualcomm sports $6.4 billion if trailing free cash flows.
    Over the same period, Micron instead burned $2.4 billion of
    cash.Micron's sales, margins, and income vary wildly over time.
    Qualcomm's are more stable and sane.Some of Micron's profit metrics occasionally dip into red
    ink, making it more difficult to run simple valuation tools on
    the stock. Qualcomm rarely follows suit.It adds up to a safer bet on a more predictable business.
  Heck, Qualcomm even pays a quarterly dividend, yielding 3.4% at
  today's prices. It's the risky technology stock for investors who
  normally don't touch risky technology stocks.That's all fine, but it's not my personal style of investing.
  I have a real-money stake in Micron, but none in Qualcomm,
  because the memory maker is drastically undervalued.Micron's chosen field of business happens to be extremely
  cyclical. As mentioned above, Samsung sometimes starts price wars
  over DRAM and NAND memory chips, feeding low-cost components into
  its own consumer electronics operations for a few quarters. When
  this happens, Micron stumbles. But Micron has a cushy cash
  balance to fall back on, and it's likely to pick up a few of its
  dying rivals on the cheap as they go bankrupt.So, you can pick up Micron shares when times are hard and the
  stock looks cheap, like now. Then Samsung lays off the
  memory-chip price wars again, the cycle turns, and Micron
  investors pocket some serious cash. When this exact scenario
  played out between 2012 and 2014, Micron's share prices increased
  more than sixfold in 24 months.And now we're back to a tough street price environment and
  low, low Micron share prices.The company is valued at just 1.2 times book value, meaning
  investors would barely break even if Micron stopped doing
  business and liquidated all of its assets today. Qualcomm's
  price-to-book ratio stands at 3.0, and that's still low in
  comparison to many other semiconductor giants.It's the same story if you look at enterprise value over
  EBITDA profits, price to sales, and other measures against
  fundamental financial health. Micron is priced for total
  disaster, but it actually remains poised to deliver the goods
  once this downturn passes.That's my investing thesis for Micron, and I expect to be
  handsomely rewarded in one to three years. On that time scale,
  the safer Qualcomm bet seems unlikely to beat my chosen
  champion.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

1 Investing Lesson to Take Away From InvenSense's Fall;7/29/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.If you don't have time to read this entire article, remember
  this old adage and you'll get the gist of what you should know:
  Don't put all of your eggs in one basket (or even two). The
  lessons ofInvenSense's(NYSE: INVN) fall are a bit more complicated than that, of
  course, but not by much.The last few years have been quite a ride for InvenSense
  investors. The company hit a high of about $22 per share in 2012,
  and then surpassed that in July of 2014 before starting its
  precipitous fall. It now sits around $7 per share. In
  percentage terms, the stock price has fallen nearly 73% from its
  high in 2014.makeArticleAd();InvenSense's main business is in selling motion-sensing
  components for mobile devices. These gyroscope sensors are the
  technology that allows your phone to know when it's being tilted
  a certain way (so you can play games), or to turn the touchscreen
  display off when you raise your phone to your ear.The company has specialized in those motion sensors (and a few
  other technologies) and became the key supplier of this
  technology to bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Here's where things started to fall apart for InvenSense. In
  order to gain the business of those two mobile giants, InvenSense
  sold its motion sensors at lower costs than it should have,
  putting a strain on margins.What exactly does that mean?Think for a minute about how inexpensive most products are atWal-Mart. The makers of those products sell their goods to Wal-Mart at
  cheaper prices than they would elsewhere because of the company's
  massive reach.That's good for customers because they get products at a
  cheaper price, and it's good for Wal-Mart because it's getting
  goods at discount prices that customers want. But it can end up
  hurting the product makers because their profit margins are lower
  because they've discounted the price in order to reach a broad
  consumer market.Sometimes that works out for the product makers, and sometimes
  it doesn't. Wal-Mart putting the squeeze on its suppliers is a
  well-known practice, but you can apply the same idea to Apple and
  Samsung squeezing InvenSense's sensor prices.Take a look at this chart showing the steep decline of
  InvenSense's operating and profit margins over the past few
  years:Image source:YCharts.Apple and Samsung were able to demand low component prices
  that have crushed InvenSense's margins. It's easy to assume Apple
  and Samsung are the bad guys in this story. But of course, they
  function like any other company (or person) and don't want to
  overpay for anything. And that's why we need to look at
  InvenSense's exposure to these companies as well as the pricing
  pressures.InvenSense made the mistake of getting in the situation of
  receiving about 53% of its total revenue from just Apple and
  Samsung. The company has overexposed itself to these tech giants
  for several years, and only now is it starting to remedy that by
  focusing onother revenue segments.Unfortunately, the damage has already been done.The takeawayInvenSense's problems aren't unique. Plenty of other smaller
  companies face the same predicament when supplying large
  companies with products. At first, it seems like a massive
  opportunity to make components for a big company. But if prices
  aren't able to significantly increase over time, or the supplier
  is unable to balance its exposure to major players with other
  revenues, then it quickly becomes a major problem.InvenSense has suffered from over exposure to Apple and
  Samsung, who also put intense pressure on the company's margins.
  Savvy investors would be wise to take those lesson to heart when
  evaluating investments in small companies.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Instant Analysis: Is Oracle's $9.3 Billion NetSuite Deal Smart?;7/29/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.What happened?Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) said this week that it's purchasing cloud-computing
  companyNetSuite(NYSE: N) for $9.3 billion in cash, or $109 per share. The
  deal is one of Oracle's largest in the company's history, though
  not as big as its takeover of PeopleSoft in 2004 for $10.3
  billion.In existence for 18 years, NetSuite was the first company to
  offer cloud computing applications, and Oracle says the two
  companies' services are complementary and each will coexist
  alongside the other.makeArticleAd();NetSuite CEO Zach Nelson said in apress releasethat, ""NetSuite will benefit from Oracle's global scale and reach
  to accelerate the availability of our cloud solutions in more
  industries and more countries.""The deal is expected to close
  sometime this year.Does this matter to shareholders?Oracle's purchase comes at a time when technology companies
  are focusing more of their attention and money on cloud
  computing.The public cloud computing market is currently worth an
  estimated $203 billion, according toGartner. That's got everyone fromAmazon.comtoSamsungbetting that they can take a piece of that pie (Amazon's arguably
  taking the most) and Oracle aims grab its own slice with
  NetSuite.Oracle said the purchase will be immediately accretive to its
  earnings on a non-GAAP basis in the full fiscal year. That's
  great news for investors who might be concerned with the premium
  Oracle is paying for NetSuite. The company is effectively paying
  a 19% premium to the $83 per shareNetSuite was trading at a day
  before the announcement.Oracle's purchase should certainly help the company solidify
  its position in the cloud computing space. Companies are
  increasingly looking to the lucrative reoccurring revenue that
  cloud applications bring. The deal still has to get the approval
  of shareholders and regulators, but once it does Oracle will be

InvenSense, Inc. Eyes Diversification After Another Slow Quarter;7/29/2016;"Image source: InvenSense.InvenSense, Inc.(NYSE: INVN) released fiscal first-quarter 2017 results Thursday
  after the market close, and delivered as promised, given its core
  mobile market remained soft.makeArticleAd();Quarterly revenue fell 43% year over year, to $60.6 million
  and, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
  translated to a net loss of $20.2 million, or $0.22 per
  share.On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which excludes items like
  stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related
  intangibles, InvenSense's gross margin came in at 46% for the
  quarter, and its net loss was $4.9 million, or $0.05 per
  share.For perspective, each of the above figures were near the high
  end of InvenSense's respective guidance ranges, which called for
  quarterly revenue of $58 million to $62 million, adjusted gross
  margin of 45% to 46%, and an adjusted net loss per share between
  $0.06 and $0.05.InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi elaborated:While worldwide consumer and mobile markets were somewhat
    soft in the first fiscal quarter of 2017,
    the InvenSense team delivered on our financial
    guidance, posting incrementally higher non-GAAP gross margins
    in a competitive environment. This was the result of
    improved manufacturing efficiency and product mix, as well as
    our traction in both mobile and non-mobile markets. We are
    successfully leveraging investments in our robust sensor
    platform to integrate and enable high-value, consumer-driven
    use cases, such as image stabilization, augmented and virtual
    reality, and inertial navigation, for applications spanning a
    number of vertical markets. These are creating exciting growth
    opportunities that we believe play well into our focused
    strengths.In fact, just prior to its earnings release, InvenSense
  unveiled its new ICM-201603, a six-axis inertial sensor targeting
  augmented and virtual reality/head-mounted display applications.
  Considering IHS predicts these applications will boast more than
  50% compound annual growth rates over the next several years,
  InvenSense is wisely positioning itself to capitalize on another
  promising market.On a segment basis, smartphones and tablet shipments comprised
  63% of total revenue during the quarter, up sequentially from 54%
  in fiscal Q4. Optical image stabilization (OIS) represented
  around 12% of sales, down from 14% last quarter. And InvenSense's
  ""Other Bucket,"" which notably including Internet of Things (IoT)
  applications like drones, VR, wearables, and smart homes, was 25%
  of revenue this quarter, down from 32% last quarter.Of course, the shift back toward the sluggish mobile market
  might not seem favorable for InvenSense, especially as it works
  to diversify with design wins in other markets. During the
  subsequent conference call, however, InvenSense CFO Mark
  Dentinger noted that shipments into the IoT/other bucket space,
  in particular, tend to be much heavier in the company's fiscal
  fourth quarter. As such, Dentinger says, we should see
  IoT-related shipments ""bounce back in terms of absolute dollars""
  in the coming quarters.In the meantime, InvenSense had one customer individually
  represent 46% of total revenue -- almost certainlyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) based on the geographic breakdown below -- with no
  other customers representing more than 10% of revenue during the
  quarter. Recall there were two 10%-plus customers last quarter,
  with the first likely being Apple at 39%, andSamsunga distant second at 14%.Geographically based on the headquarters of each customer, the
  United States represented 50% of total revenue in Q1, up from 43%
  in fiscal Q4. Korea came in at 9% of sales, down from 11% last
  quarter. China fell to 20% this quarter, down from 32% last
  quarter. Japan and Taiwan also each came in at 9%, up from 5% and
  6%, respectively, last quarter. And contributions from customers
  in the ""rest of world"" category remained steady on a sequential
  basis at 3%.Finally, for the current quarter (fiscal 2017 Q2), InvenSense
  expects revenue in the range of $77 million to $83 million,
  adjusted gross margin between 45.5% and 46.5%, and adjusted net
  income per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.04. By comparison,
  and though we don't typically pay much attention to Wall Street's
  near-term demands, analysts' consensus estimates predicted
  roughly the same per-share earnings on revenue near the low end
  of InvenSense's guidance at $78.6 million.While some investors may have hoped for more, there were no
  big surprises in what ultimately appears to be a slightly
  better-than-expected performance from InvenSense this quarter.
  But I don't think that's a bad thing considering InvenSense still
  holds a commanding majority of its addressable markets. As long
  as the company continues to maintain a central enabling position
  as motion-sensing devices become more ubiquitous, investors
  should be happy with where it stands.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

"McDonald's ""Experience of the Future"" Is Coming to the U.S.";7/28/2016;"This is what your McDonald's may someday look like. Image
  source:SOTI.McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) has rolled out its next-generation restaurant in
  parts of Europe, Canada, and Australia, and now the company plans
  to further expand the program in the United States.makeArticleAd();The fast-food chain, which has ridden all-day breakfast to
  turn around its business, hopes that adding technology to its
  eateries can improve the customer experience and drive sales.
  Called ""Experience of the Future,"" the McDonald's initiative
  involves addingSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy tablets to its locations.Customers can use the tablets, which are mounted tableside and
  sitting in kiosks, to order custom ""gourmet"" burgers in the
  United Kingdom restaurants where they have been deployed. In some
  cases, the tablets are used to entertain customers, and in
  Sweden, Investopedia reported, they can be used to turn a Happy
  Meal box into a set of virtual reality goggles.Since ""Experience of the Future"" remains in the pilot phase,
  exactly how it will work remains a bit of a moving target.
  Ultimately, though, it's easy to see the tablets being used for
  ordering, offering a heavy level of customization without
  requiring a frontline worker to get everything right from a
  verbal order. In addition, the devices could entertain customers
  while they wait for food and allow them to pay their bill.It's still early in the process and McDonald's does not have a
  formal rollout plan yet, but CEO Stephen Easterbrook called it ""a
  very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S.""
  in the company's Q2 earnings call (as transcribed bySeeking Alpha). He also acknowledged that while he is being mindful of
  short-term needs, ""we don't want to lose the strategic direction
  that we believe is right for long term.""The company said in its conference call that more than half of
  its restaurants in Canada have been fully converted to the
  ""Experience of the Future,"" while the U.K. count is near 40% and
  France is at nearly 25%, with table service in about 80% of
  restaurants.How has it been working?In the U.K., which has been a big test market for the new
  store concept, McDonald's has partnered with enterprise
  mobility management company SOTI to change how McDonald's and it
  customers interact. SOTIcalled""Experience of the Future,"" which also involves updating the look
  of the stores, ""the biggest investment and operational change in
  its 41 year history in the U.K.""That sounds like hyperbole, but when you think about it,
  McDonald's operates roughly the same way it did since it started
  becoming a major brand in the 1960s. The new concept brings the
  chain into, if not the future, at least the present, according to
  McDonald's UK IT head Doug Baker.""Technology has an important role to play in all walks of
  life, including our customers' eating out experience, so the
  changes we're making as part of the 'Experience of the Future'
  program bring us closer to the way people live their lives
  today,"" he said in the press release. ""We pride ourselves on
  listening to customers and providing an outstanding experience;
  innovations such as tablets help provide this experience and have
  been extremely popular with customers.""In the conference call, Easterbrook said the ""Experience of
  the Future"" is already a success: ""We are seeing a good pickup in
  sales as we roll this out ...  So we know we're onto
  something. We know customers respond well. And certainly, it
  breathes a lot of new life into our restaurants and into the
  brand.""Why is this important to McDonald's?In a broad sense, at least in the U.S., McDonald's has lagged
  behind some of its competitors when it comes to technology. The
  chain does not allow ordering through its app nor does it offer a
  mobile-pay option. Easterbrook acknowledged this during the
  earnings call and pointed out that the company has been testing
  various technologies in order to speed up service while improving
  order accuracy.""The real devil [is] in the detail, down to the font size on
  the order receipts to make sure our teams who are collecting the
  orders can gather the right items,"" he said. ""But also, there's a
  lot of work we're doing in the future where we believe we can
  also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do
  some of that heavy lifting for us.""Going forward, ""Experience of the Future"" could solve those
  problems. Orders placed via a tablet can be incredibly detailed,
  with a much lower possibility of mistakes being made. Want one
  pickle, light ketchup, and no special sauce? That's an easy order
  to place via a tablet, but perhaps one that would cause problems
  in a drive-thru line.Adding technology should lead to happier customers with a side
  of lower employee costs. If tablets take the orders, then actual
  people don't have to. That does allow for more space behind the
  counter for production, but it also should lower costs in a
  meaningful way.The McDonald's of the future may only be a mix of theStarbucksand Chili's of today, but it's a big step into the present for
  the chain, which should increase customer satisfaction while
  growing the bottom line.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Can InvenSense Keep Moving Forward?;7/27/2016;"IMAGE SOURCE: INVENSENSE, INC.InvenSense Inc.(NYSE: INVN) is set to release fiscal first-quarter 2017 results
  this Thursday, July 28, after the market close. With shares
  having largely recovered after disappointing guidance
  overshadowed the motion-sensor chip specialist'ssolid Q1 resultsthree months ago -- but still down more than 30% year to date as
  of this writing -- InvenSense would love for a strong report to
  help sustain its recent momentum.makeArticleAd();So what should we be watching when InvenSense's fiscal Q1
  release hits the wires?InvenSense's latest guidance calls for quarterly revenue of
  $58 million to $62 million, representing a 43.6% year-over-year
  decline at the midpoint thanks to the recent softening of the
  overall mobile market. As such, InvenSense told investors to
  expect adjusted gross margin in the range of 45% to 46%, which
  should translate to an adjusted net loss per share between $0.05
  and $0.06.That's fair enough, as orders related to the smartphone and
  tablet industries comprised around 54% of InvenSense's total
  revenue last quarter. What's more, InvenSense had two customers
  that individually accounted for 39% and 14% of total sales,
  respectively.Though InvenSense doesn't typically name names, it does
  usually break down its revenue on a geographic basis. And with
  clients in the U.S. and South Korea comprising around 43% and 11%
  of total sales last quarter, respectively, those big customers
  were almost certainlyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . Either way, considering Apple just told
  investors earlier this week thatiPhone unit sales dropped 15%year over year in its most recent quarter, it seems fair to say
  InvenSense's caution surrounding the mobile space was
  merited.To InvenSense's credit, it should also continue to demonstrate
  progress diversifying its business away from smartphones and
  toward other industries, including optical image stabilization
  (14% of last quarter's sales), and its so-called ""other bucket""
  (32% of sales). In particular, the ""other bucket"" segment
  includes chip platforms related to the Internet of Things to
  support products such as drones, virtual and augmented reality,
  wearables, smart homes, and industrial applications. What's more,
  around 80% of InvenSense's design-win pipeline isoutsidethe mobile industry.As InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi stated during last quarter's
  call, ""On a fundamental level, we have taken significant steps in
  our transformation from a mobile-concentrated single product
  company toward a broad-based multi-sensor solution company.""Because we're still in the early stages of growth for many of
  these applications, however, it's difficult to predict how
  significant of a tailwind they can provide in any given quarter.
  So while any outperformance from its supplemental market
  verticals will probably offer InvenSense's best chance at posting
  upbeat results, in the meantime InvenSense investors can only
  assume their company will be left to endure today's mobile
  weakness until it eventually abates.Relatedly, listen for InvenSense to give investors a peek at
  what's to come, including its outlook for revenue, gross margin,
  operating expenses, and earnings per share in the current
  quarter. For perspective -- and though we don't usually pay close
  attention to Wall Street's near-term demands -- analysts'
  consensus estimates predict that InvenSense will swing back to an
  adjusted quarterly profit of $0.03 per share for its fiscal
  second quarter of 2017, with revenue down roughly 30% year over
  year, to $78.6 million.In the end, whether InvenSense lives up to that guidance
  remains to be seen. But arguably more important to long-term
  investors will be whether the company demonstrates that the worst
  is now behind it.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Apple's Chinese Woes Extend Beyond Regulatory And Macro Headwinds;7/27/2016;"Apple published its fiscal Q3 earnings on Tuesday,
reporting that revenues fell by 15% year-over-year to about
$42.4 billion amid shipment declines across its major product
lines, while gross margins also contracted by 170 basis points to
38%, on account of a growing mix of low-end iPhone sales
and FX impacts. Although the results were better than expected, the
company's performance in Greater China - a region that
has been the biggest source of growth in recent years - was
concerning. Revenues from the market (which includes
Mainland China, Hong Kong and China)declined by about 33%
year-over-year to roughly $8.8 billion, accounting for
about 60% of Apple's overall revenue decline for the
quarter. While the decline was partly due to a tough
comparison with Q3 FY'15 and the regulatory and economic headwinds
Apple faces in China,  it could also be reflective of a more
competitive and dynamic smartphone market.We have a$123 price estimate for Apple,which is about 25% ahead of the current market price. We
will be updating our model and price estimate to account for
the recent earnings.See Our Complete Analysis For Apple HeremakeArticleAd();Local Vendors Gaining Share
  With Solid Devices, Shorter Product
  Life CyclesCompetition in the Chinese smartphone space has heated up, with
domestic players bolstering market share by launching feature-rich
handsets at relatively attractive prices, backed up by clever
branding and marketing. According to data from Counterpoint
Research, Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone market in June
stood at 9%, down from about 13% in June 2015. On the other hand,
Chinese companies Oppo and Huawei held 22.9% and 17.4%
shares, respectively.Local players also appear to be innovating more quickly
compared to Apple. Vendors such as Xiaomi and Huawei launch new
devices every other month, with frequent software
updates, making Apple's annual product updates and
biennial industrial design refreshes seem relatively lackluster in
comparison. For instance, Chinese vendors have been offering
the dual lens camera - which is expected to be the
signature feature of Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 Plus - for
close to a year now. Although iPhones are likely to score above
Chinese devices in terms of overall user experience and refinement,
the cost-to-benefit scales seem to be tipping in favor of
these Chinese vendors.Cloud Based Services Are Undermining Apple's Ecosystem
  AdvantageThe increasing proliferation of cloud based-services, ranging
from streaming music to social media and messaging, are also likely
to be undermining Apple's historical ecosystem advantage.
These services are typically platform-agnostic, implying that
customers can access them irrespective of the operating system that
their devices run. This could be reducing
the switching costs for consumers on Apple devices, prompting
them to look for lower-priced alternatives.Macro Uncertainty And FX HeadwindsThere are also some macroeconomic concerns in China, amid
currency headwinds and a slowing economy. The Chinese Yuan has
depreciated by 7% versus the U.S. dollar since August
2015, reducing Apple's sales in dollar terms. The Chinese
economy is also slowing down, with growth projected at just about
6.5% in 2016, and expected to slow further next year. That
said, retail sales are looking up, as the government looks to
transition the economy towards services and consumption.
However this could lead the government to favor home-grown
smartphone manufacturers over Apple.Regulatory Headwinds Could Weigh On Apple's
  Fastest-Growing BusinessApple has been increasingly banking on services to
drive its top line and earnings, leveraging its 1
billion+ device installed base. Services revenues grew by
about 19% y-o-y to about $6 billion during Q3, and the
segment is now Apple's second largest after the iPhone.
 However, Apple's services have been facing some
challenges in China, amid increasing interference by
the Chinese government.In April, the company had to shut down its
iBooks and iTunes Movie services in the country just a few months
after launch, while the lucrative App store is also being
subjected to increasing regulation.View Interactive Institutional

Why the Apple Inc. iPhone 6SE Won't Be a Thing;7/25/2016;"Image source: Apple.A report recently surfaced claiming thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) may call its next-generation iPhone, widely
  believed to be called the iPhone 7, the ""iPhone 6SE.""makeArticleAd();Here's why this report, which comes from Apfelpage.de (via
  9to5Mac), seems unlikely to be true.A marketing nightmareThe iPhone 6s didn't perform particularly well in the
  marketplace. During its cycle, Apple has seemingly lost market
  segment share to its rivals and saw its first-ever declines in
  iPhone unit and revenue shipments year over year.Apple blamed the year-over-year decline essentially on tough
  comparisons to the prior cycle, but that alone doesn't explain
  the market share loss. Clearly, Apple's marketing team failed to
  determine what features/technologies would be required to keep
  pace in the marketplace.If Apple were to name its next-generation iPhone family the
  iPhone 6SE, this would send a pretty negative message to
  consumers. In particular, it would say to them that this new
  iPhone isn't much of an improvement over the prior-generation
  iPhone 6s series, potentially leading to muted upgrade
  activity.In fact, with a name like the iPhone 6SE, not only would
  iPhone 6s owners be hard-pressed to upgrade, but average iPhone 6
  users -- likely folks who don't follow the nitty-gritty details
  of each iPhone launch -- might think that the latest phone isn't
  much improved over what they already have.That's not exactly the message that Apple can afford to send
  to customers with the coming product cycle -- at least not if it
  wants to have a reasonable shot at stabilizing/growing iPhone
  revenues after a rough fiscal year.Another reason that this naming would be
    disastrousApple's chief rival in many respects isSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . The iPhone and iPhone Plus models generally
  compete with Samsung's Galaxy S/Galaxy S Edge/Galaxy Note family
  of products.Unlike Apple, which has introduced ""new number"" phones in one
  year and ""s"" variants of those phones in the next, the Galaxy S
  phone series sees ""new numbers"" each year. In 2016, Samsung
  released the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and is on track to
  release the Galaxy Note 7 (skipping the Galaxy Note 6
  entirely).If Apple were to release the iPhone 6SE this year, not only
  would Apple's fall release be behind in numbering relative to
  Samsung's latest (this may seem trivial, but marketing/perception
  is quite important), but Samsung would pull further ahead with
  the spring launch of the Galaxy S8.Applereallywouldn't have a good time trying to market an ""iPhone 6SE""
  against a ""Galaxy S8.""iPhone 7s much more likely than iPhone 6SE this
    yearAs Iarguedin a previous column, it could be in Apple's best interests to
  call the next-generation iPhone the iPhone 7s rather than merely
  the iPhone 7. Such a naming scheme would allow Apple to play up
  the improvements in going from the iPhone 6s to the next
  phone.The following iPhone could be called the iPhone 8 and then
  going forward, the company could eliminate the ""s"" models
  altogether, instead moving to new numbers from that point on.
  This would help Apple stay competitive with Samsung from a
  marketing/branding perspective.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Visa, PayPal And The Future Of Payments;7/25/2016;"ByKaren Webster:There's no doubt that the announcement of the Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL)partnershipshook the payments world more than a little bit last Thursday.Over the last year, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman made a point, every
chance he could, to let everyone know that he was the chief of a
decidedly differentPayPal, post its eBay (EBAY) independence. That PayPal, he said, was one that embraced
partnerships and consumer choice. The network that started life
steering consumers to ACH, he emphasized, was now indifferent to
tender type. The consumer ruled.Over that same year, Visa CEO Charlie Scharf made it perfectly
clear that players in the payments sphere fell into two distinct
camps: they were either with Visa or against it. Frenemy, schenemy
he as much said - this co-opetition stuff doesn't reflect the
reality of how the payments ecosystem and the issuer-centric
network model that has been the cornerstone of the payments
industry for more than 50 years operates. And since PayPal's ACH
model was still alive and well - with a chunk of accounts
transacting that way - Scharf made it clear that PayPal's business
model was a concern.makeArticleAd();So, what generated the collective industry gasp last Thursday
was the public affirmation that those two players had buried that
hatchet.But, like most any big announcement in payments - and this
really juicy one - it has led to many different
interpretations.Some immediately remarked that the partnership will give
in-store NFC payments a real boost. Analysts have expressed
concerns that it will totally crater PayPal's business model (an
opinion that saw its stock take more than a 9 percent hit on Friday
- it ended the day down 6.75 percent). And some of the more
sinister soothsayers suggest that Visa now has the benefit of
having PayPal under its watchful eye as it simultaneously scales
its own digital competitor, Checkout.All things that make for nice headlines and clicks, but they are
observations that are also somewhat off base.They all miss the potential that both Visa and PayPal have to
use the next 12 months of exclusivity of their multi-year
relationship to change the dynamics of the payments landscape in
the U.S., and the actions of every single player in it.If they can execute.So, here's my take on what this partnership is - and isn't.IT'S NOT ABOUT NFCOne thing's for certain: when NFC is the hammer, every in-store
payments announcement is a nail.Yes, the deal with Visa and its access to Visa's token services,
VDEP, is big. At the jump, it gives PayPal an easy and immediate
on-ramp as a token requestor to enable contactless in-store
payments where Visa contactless payments are accepted and Visa
methods of payments are used.As a refresher, VDEP eliminates the bilateral contractual
rigmarole that makes it hard for other contactless payments schemes
that require those individual contractual negotiations to achieve
commercial scale. It also sets out parameters for how token
requestors and issuers will play together, including rules that
forbid token requestors from imposing fees. This partnership gives
issuers the chance to opt in to becoming a digitized, tokenized
credential in a consumer's PayPal account for use in-store under
that program. And opt-in is a whole lot easier and faster than
negotiating commercial terms.Instead of getting bogged down in negotiating the Ts and Cs of a
commercial agreement, the work between the issuers and PayPal is
about enabling account holders to use their Visa cards in the
PayPal account. Things like who owns what data (the data for any
PayPal/Visa transaction will be shared exactly as if a Visa card
was presented and swiped), how Visa accounts will be positioned at
signup (equal positioning with ACH options) and when transacting
(visible and digitized card credentials in the transaction flow)
has already been negotiated. Merchants also will probably get
favorable pricing as part of this deal, too, because PayPal gets
negotiated economic incentives which will pass along in part - more
on that later.And, yes, while VDEP surely does give PayPal the ability to
check the in-store payments box and allows its app and Visa issuers
who opt-in to have parity with the other in-store ""Pays"" at those
places that accept NFC payments, there are a couple of big ""buts""
that offer some big clues into where in-store may be headed with
this partnership.""But"" No. 1 is that VDEP, at the moment, only extends to PayPal
apps running on Android phones. So that limits the in-store
capability to the unknown number of Visa credentialed PayPal
account holders who own Android phones capable of making an NFC
payment who also walk into merchant locations with NFC. And while
that number may be unknown, it's probably small and maybe even too
small to get people all fired up about.Which brings me to ""but"" No. 2.Of the 2 million merchant locations that are NFC-enabled, 400k
or so are vending machines. According to Visa's latest EMV stats,
there are still 72 percent of merchants without EMV terminals - and
that means there are still 72 percent of merchants that aren't
equipped to enable NFC anytime soon. There's also no guarantee that
100 percent of the 1.2 million EMV terminals also are NFC enabled
and at the places that consumers shop regularly enough to develop a
digital in-store mobile payments habit.It is therefore unlikely that either party perceives the
Visa/PayPal VDEP capability as the in-store NFC payments' silver
bullet even though it was a nice bullet in the presser. For digital
payments to play at scale and ignite, the solution must be
cloud-based, cross platform/cross OS and cross-channel. I think
just about everyone knows this now - or at least I hope so.More likely, VDEP is the tip of very big digital payments
iceberg that could transform in-store payments in a material way.When I chatted with Visa'sGlobal EVP and Head of Innovation last year, Jim McCarthy, at the
launch of VDEP, he mentioned that VDEP was technology agnostic. In
fact, he said that Visa's token service ""gives the merchant the
ability to choose whether at the point of sale the consumer
presents a QR code or an NFC radio signal or a BLE beacon-enabled
transaction, because VDEP is agnostic in that respect.""Now that's interesting.PayPal ownsPaydiant, which has its own portfolio of in-store payments technologies.
And Braintree, which has put in market what Schulman described as
the most ""rapidly adopted product in PayPal history"" - One Touch.
VDEP's technology-agnostic, efficient issuer integration platform
would seem to give the folks at PayPal and Visa the opportunity to
fine tune a slick, in-store customer experience that goes well
beyond subbing a tap for a swipe to unlocking new value for
merchants and consumers.That's where I'm placing my bets.IT'S ABOUT THE TRANSACTION VOLUMEInvestors did not like it when PayPal CFO John Rainey suggested
that 2017 would deliver increased transaction expenses as a result
of changes to its funding mix. PayPal's stock price ended Friday
(July 22) down more than 6 percent, recovering a bit from being
down more than 9 percent earlier in the day.I, though, focused on three other comments that I believe round
out the story: the tail end of Rainey's comments on transaction
costs, a very pointed phrase that Schulman emphasized several times
in his own remarks and Scharf's own description of the deal
terms.Rainey spoke of gaining ""certainty over cost control,"" Schulman
said the deal with Visa eliminated the ""threat of any targeted
pricing actions"" and Scharf remarked that the deal affords PayPal
""greater longer term fee certainty.""Taken together, this suggests that absent a deal, PayPal might
have been facing onerous cost-side increases of another kind that
could have had a material impact on the business. Eliminating that
uncertainty via this partnership means that everyone can get on
with the business of business - growing the digital payments
footprint for consumers, issuers and merchants.Which is all about increasing transaction volume.Although details are scant, as one might expect, both Schulman
and Scharf acknowledged during the earnings call that economic
incentives are being extended to PayPal in exchange for increased
volume.There are a few ways that the partnership is designed to drive
transaction volume.There is a 12-month exclusivity period for Visa issuers to
promote their own, branded digital credentials within the PayPal
account. I would imagine that issuers would jump at that chance to
ride the ""top of digital wallet"" with the largest digital payments
player in the market, worldwide. I can also imagine that such
efforts might be accompanied by some creative marketing initiatives
to drive account enrollment and usage - with maybe Visa even
kicking in a few bucks of its own. And since PayPal is accepted at
more than 14 million merchants, all of these consumer incentives
actually give consumers the opportunity to use those digital
account credentials at the places they like to shop around the
digital ecosystem. And giving PayPal the chance to drive usage from
29 transactions to something that's more like once a day.Those marketing activities also will be linked to a few things
also stipulated as part of the agreement: PayPal agreeing to
position Visa equally with ACH account options at signup,
incorporating digital images of Visa cards into the payments flow
so they are prominently featured as the top of wallet option, and
working with issuers to help convert PayPal's Visa ACH customers to
Visa debit customers should the consumer wish to make the
switch.It's that last part that has everyone worried, but maybe it
shouldn't.We don't really know - and PayPal does not disclose - how much
of its volume in the U.S. is ACH-driven. PayPal suggests that it's
not as straightforward a calculation, given the mix of P2P volume
inside of its numbers. So, we don't really know how much of the
PayPal volume is really a target for the switching - but it's
obviously enough to have Visa concerned.But whatever that number is, now, thanks to Durbin (and it's
rare that we ever say ""thanks to Durbin"") that revenue hit won't be
as huge as it once might have been. There's a gap between ACH and
debit, of course, but it isn't as wide as the days before Durbin.
The size of that gap depends on those negotiated incentives that
PayPal and Visa have worked out and what PayPal pays for ACH
today.But what I take away from the ""economic incentives"" narrative is
that both sides will work together to do something that should have
been baked into every precedingmobile payments ignitionscheme: giving issuers - and by default consumers - incentives to
activate digital accounts and use them. TPV - total payments volume
- after all, is the name of the game.A volume game, played by meeting and serving consumers across
every channel and every payments use case they encounter.IT'S ABOUT DEBITOne aspect of the announcement that I think got lost in the
in-store and no more tender-steering news is the additional
value-add that this relationship brings to PayPal's P2P users and
Visa's debit business.And the pretty big hole that it blew in the set of initiatives
that banks are - and have been - undertaking to make P2P a
ubiquitous reality via its own schemes.Venmo users, who sent $4 billion between people in Q2, can now
get instant access to that money if they use a Visa debit product.
This instant accessibility of funds also is available to PayPal P2P
users.This does a few things for Visa and PayPal/Venmo.First, it provides a huge incentive for PayPal/Venmo users to
attach their Visa cards to their accounts.Second, it provides Visa issuers with a new opportunity to
market real-time availability of funds via this P2P capability and
use it as a way to acquire and retain debit card users. Since
millennials are Venmo's prime demographic, this could become
crucial to competing for the millennial demographic that issuers so
covet - adding even more deposit accounts to the mix for issuers
and P2P volume for PayPal/Venmo.Third, it eliminates the friction and uncertainty issuers have
with their current bank-driven P2P initiatives. Ubiquity is what's
needed to really put teeth into P2P and make it a friction-free
experience. That doesn't exist today with any of the schemes. Visa
debit rails plus Venmo and PayPal can get pretty darn close.That means that, fourth, this capability also opens up a
potentially whole new series of use cases for real-time payments
between people and between businesses and people - from paying
insurance claims, to paying contract or gig workers, to disbursing
royalties using those rails.Those same use cases that the faster payments folks have been
advocating that banks invest in expensive new sets of rails to
support.IT COULD BE ABOUT A NEW WHOLE DIGITAL PAYMENTS PARADIGMThe one unanswered question for most payments peeps is where
Visa Checkout now sits in the midst of this announcement. Visa
Checkout was launched just about two years ago - in July 2014 - as
the replacement for V.me. Checkout shifted Visa's focus from a
wallet that aggregated a variety of digital payments artifacts to
just making checkout online simple and fast.When asked about Checkout on the earnings call, Scharf said that
Visa Checkout is chugging right along, although he declined to
offer stats on users and merchants. Thelast time Visa reported Checkout numbers- March 2016 - it stood at 11 million users across 16 countries and
more than 250k merchants. Scharf spoke instead to the enhancements
to Checkout - a streamlined user experience and new ways for
issuers to be branded inside the app.There's a short-term and a long-term way of looking at
Checkout's future vis-a-vis the Visa/PayPal partnership.If I'm a Visa issuer and what I really want is volume on my
cards and sticky digitally transacting customers, I'm going to want
to be present in a variety of digital checkout scenarios as long as
I don't have to do much to get there.But what I'm going to probably do during the next 12 months of
exclusivity with PayPal, though, is blasting out a series of
incentives that get consumers using cards with the digital network
that's already accepted widely online and in-app and very likely
cooking up a cool cloud-based in-store experience. If volume is
what I want online and use of my own branded digital credentials in
that channel, this is probably one of my best shots at achieving
that.And if I'm Visa, I'm also going to use those next 12 months to
maybe even fast-track getting digital Visa credentials in as many
places as PayPal and Braintree and Venmo and Xoom can get them.Using all of those next 12 months to mobilize a digital payments
plan that puts some distance between Visa, its issuers and what
everyone else is pursuing.So that, long term, Visa and PayPal could be well-positioned to
rewire the digital payments ecosystem.Maybe that's by using the combined assets of the Visa cardholder
base and 188 million PayPal account holders to help merchants
capitalize on the digital payments experience in ways that have not
been explored before.Maybe that's by tapping the Braintree payments veins deeply
including the clever application of capabilities like Braintree
Auth, which allows permission-based sharing of tokens across
eCommerce endpoints, to expand acceptance and usage.Or by using the economic incentives that both sides have spoken
about to extend favorable terms to merchants and incentives to
cardholders to select and use Visa accounts on PayPal's digital
network.Or really thinking deeply about how to improve the shopping
experience by banking intelligence into the consumer's digital
accounts in order to further drive adoption, usage and preference
across all channels, platforms and devices.Maybe even positioning PayPal as a digital layer that connects
digitized issuer-branded credentials with any platform, any
shopping channel and any device enabled at those various
endpoints.WHO'S CHOMPING AT THE BIT AND SHAKING IN THEIR
  SHOES?Your reaction, of course, depends entirely on where you play and
what assets you bring to the digital payments party.Three days is a relatively short amount of time to absorb this
news and 12 months a relatively short amount of time to execute,
although as both sides point out, it is a ""multi-year"" partnership
agreement.If you're one of the ""Pay"" players, it remains in Visa's and
PayPal's interest to make their products attractive to everyone so
that consumer choice can really be delivered. But both of them also
have made a decision to allocate their own resources - time, people
and money - to making sure that the partnership lives up to the
terms of the deal and maximizes the 12-month exclusivity for Visa
issuers.Those who could hurt the most beside the many smaller ""Pay""
players who will struggle to get any merchant attention now? Apple
Pay (AAPL) and Samsung Pay (SSNLF).Apple Pay- since issuers will be given an incentive to put their muscle
behind a scheme that's more widely accepted and used across a
variety of shopping channels. And Samsung Pay given its very narrow
user potential (just Android, then just Samsung, then just new
Samsung devices) despite having a pretty slick technology. Like
Apple Pay, they are device and OS dependent but unlike Apple Pay,
they have a much smaller and seemingly less attractive user base to
offer merchants.Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), on the other hand, could make for a very
interesting partner if it take off its Android Pay hat and put on
its Google Commerce hats. I can imagine lots of clever scenarios in
which a Visa/PayPal and Google mash-up could drive volume to
Google's various commerce platforms, including YouTube, Maps and
Search.Chase (JPMorgan Chase (JPM)) will be an interesting one to
watch. As one of Visa's largest issuers, it should be thrilled and
very motivated to provide top of digital wallet status to its
PayPal users. As Chase Pay, the new mobile wallet ""Pay"" to be
launched later, it might face some new and unanticipated
competition from the newly combined PayPal/Visa capabilities
in-store and online - depending on how each partner takes that part
of their offer to market.American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS) - well, they've been
pretty invisible in the digital world so far and this partnership
has the potential to make that invisibility even more so. It also
puts tremendous pressure on both of them to make a move, which
could even include an acquisition of some kind or to put themselves
in play to be acquired, depending.MasterCard (MA), of course, made an announcement of its own last
weekwhen they acquiredU.K. payments system VocaLink.The once bank-owned system that's a dominant player in the U.K.
payments market and enables real-time/faster payments in multiple
countries, including a contract to do the same here in the U.S.
with The Clearing House, is a way for MasterCard to extend consumer
choice via its own payments network through direct debit access.
While many have suggested that MasterCard and VocaLink is simply a
way for MasterCard to beef up its base in the U.K. where Visa is
already quite strong, I think there may be more to it than
that.When put alongside its newly enhanced MasterPass cross-channel,
cross-platform and cross-device strategy unveiled two weeks ago, I
think that it's a signal that MasterCard is looking to operate a
global set of real-time rails that move money between people and
businesses using any payment tender across any connected endpoint.
The now have assembled network assets - they now need merchants and
consumers to hop on board.And that's what's so interesting to me about Visa and PayPal.
They each bring network assets and consumers to the party. Visa, as
the largest card network in the world, brings 14k FIs and the
consumers they have in tow. PayPal, as the largest digital payments
network in the world, brings 188 million active users who've
developed a habit of using PayPal - and are increasing that usage.
PayPal also brings lots more ""dormant"" PayPal accounts that this
partnership could ""wake up"" with new incentives for account holders

    TipsHere are yourApple Rumorsfor today:Car:A new report claims thatApple(AAPL) executive Bob Mansfield will be leading the company's car
  efforts, reports TechCrunch. This news comes from insider sources
  that are close to the matter. They claim that the tech company
  will have him take over the Project Titan effort and that he will
  report directly to AAPL CEO Tim Cook. Mansfield left
  the company's board in 2013, but stayed on work on a special
  project that turned out to be the Apple Watch. There's still be
  no official confirmation from the company that it's developing
  its own vehicle.makeArticleAd();6SE:A new rumor claims that Apple won't be releasing
  the iPhone 7 later this year, AppleInsider notes. According to this rumor, the tech company
  is planning to call its 2016 iPhone the iPhone 6SE. If true,
  this means that the company is switching to the three-year
  redesign cycle that has been previously rumored. This change
  would also allow the planned device to fall in line with the
  iPhone SE that was released earlier this year. Not introducing
  the iPhone 7 could make sense seeing as leaks of the 2016 iPhone
  have only shown minor outer changes when compared to previous
  major redesigns.Sensors:Rumor has it that Apple is planning to release an

Apple's Rivals Just Made Rumors of Absent Headphone Jack Stronger;7/23/2016;"Image source: Motorola.Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhone is likely to ship with a faster
  processor and better camera, two features that should help the
  Cupertino tech giant remain on top of an increasingly competitive
  smartphone market. Yet the phone may be defined more by what it
  lacks than what it offers.Apple is widely expected to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack in
  favor of Bluetooth and lightning-based audio on the next
  iPhone. The move will be controversial. The 3.5mm port
  is tried and true, and almost every set of headphones currently
  in existence makes use of it. Consumers who upgrade to the latest
  iPhone may also need to upgrade their headphones, or make use of
  a cumbersome dongle.makeArticleAd();But Apple's competitors have already beaten it to the punch.
  Lenovo's forthcoming flagship, the Moto Z, has no headphone port.
  It goes on sale later this month, many weeks before the next
  iPhone, and could provide some sense of the backlash a headphone
  port-less iPhone will generate.A USB-C dongle in every boxAt first glance, the Moto Z looks like a pretty typical
  Android flagship. There's a 5.5-inch display, speedy Snapdragon
  820 processor, and plenty of RAM. It has some interesting
  features, most notably support for swappable, modular backplates,
  but the one thing it doesn't have is a 3.5mm headphone port. It
  has a single USB-C port located on its lower side. That port is
  used to charge the device, but it can also send out an audio
  signal.Included with every Moto Z is a small USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter.
  Bundling it with the phone is a consumer-friendly move, but it's
  not a perfect solution: Moto Z owners who wish to use traditional
  headphones will have one extra cord to worry about -- one more
  thing to carry around, one more thing to lose. And even with the
  adapter, the situation isn't perfect: You can't charge the phone
  and listen to headphones at the same time. Ultimately, some may
  find the burden too much and opt for a different handset
  entirely.In general, reviewers haven't been overly impressed with the
  Moto Z, but they haven't written it off entirely, either. Most of
  the criticism has stemmed from its excessive price tag, mediocre
  camera, and Motorola's poor track record of delivering timely
  software updates, with its missing headphone jack serving only as
  a modest knock on the device rather than an outright
  dealbreaker.""The Moto Z...has some good things going for it, but
  unfortunately...it has just as many in the average category...you
  get an average camera, average battery life, [and] a phone that
  isn't that much fun to hold,"" wroteDroid Life's Kellex. ""It's not as polished or sculpted a phone asSamsung's Galaxy S7. Nor is its camera as good. Nor is it waterproof.
  Nor does it have a headphone jack...the [Galaxy S7] is probably a
  better phone,"" wroteWired's David Pierce.Is Apple about to make a mistake?Bluetooth audio has improved tremendously in recent years, and
  Bluetooth headphones can now be had for as little as $20.
  Unfortunately, Bluetooth headphones have their own internal
  batteries, which means their owners need to remember to recharge
  them. They also have to be paired and unpaired, which can be a
  confusing, and at times difficult, process. But the upside is
  just as significant: There's no cord to get in the way.In the U.S., the Moto Z will (at least initially) be
  restricted toVerizon, launched as the latest installment in the long-running DROID
  series of phones. That will restrict its market to Verizon
  subscribers. Moreover, Motorola has -- for many years -- been a
  third-tier smartphone-maker, with its U.S. market share hovering
  around a modest 5% (compared to upwards of 40% for Apple).That will make comparing the relative success of the Moto Z
  with that of the iPhone difficult. Still, its existence should
  benefit Apple. If Apple does ditch the 3.5mm port, it won't be
  alone. Other Android OEMs could follow Motorola, and in time,
  consumers could come to view the 3.5mm as a relic of the past.
  Bluetooth headphones should enjoy rising popularity, and
  increasing ubiquity, making the prospect of a headphone jack-less
  iPhone far more palatable.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

IDC Says Apple Watch Shipments Drop 55%;7/21/2016;"After an early morning pop, shares of AppleAAPLare down about over 0.5% on Thursday after an afternoon report from
International Data Corp that slammed the state of the wearable
smartwatch market. According to IDC, Apple saw its Watch sales fall
55% in the second quarter.Apple is the leading seller of smartwatches throughout the
world, and the global smartwatch market saw sales decline 32% in
the quarter. IDC bases their research on market data, and Apple did
not immediately respond to a request to confirm the report,
according toCNBC.Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device
Trackers, commented on the state of the market in today'sreport.""Consumers have held off on smartwatch purchases since early
2016 in anticipation of a hardware refresh, and improvements in
WatchOS are not expected until later this year, effectively
stalling existing Apple Watch sales,"" Ubrani said. ""Apple still
maintains a significant lead in the market and unfortunately a
decline for Apple leads to a decline in the entire market.Apple was the only top seller to record a yearly decline, while

Apple (AAPL) Q3 Earnings: Will it Disappoint this Time?;7/21/2016;"Apple, Inc.AAPLis set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 26.
Last quarter, it posted a 3.55% negative earnings surprise. The
company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of
the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise
of 1.18%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the
announcement.Factors to ConsiderSince the beginning of this year, Apple has been battling
dwindling iPhone demand. Last quarter, the company saw its revenues
decline for the first time in 13 years, of course in tune with
declining iPhone shipments and lower selling prices.We expect the to-be-reported quarter to be a weak one for the
company, given the persisting sluggishness in key regions like
China. Furthermore, SamsungSSNLFcontinues to gain traction in the smartphone market, which does not
bode well for Apple. Moreover, the recent PC shipments data from
IDC and Gartner indicate sluggish demand for Mac devices as well.
The company is entangled in a few lawsuits, which will weigh on its
financials. For instance, Apple will have to dish out $400 million
for the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit with regard to price
fixing of e-books.Nonetheless, some respite is expected from its newer enterprise
collaborations like SAP SESAPand increasing traction in markets like India. Also, some other
notable developments in the third quarter are Apple's changes to
its App Store, which also included differential pricing for app
developers based on their subscription term. Also, some other
growth drivers to watch out for are revenues from the greater Apple
ecosystem and its other services like Apple Pay and Apple Music.
However, there is no denying that soft demand for iPhone has an
impact on its other offerings.Apple had earlier given a muted outlook for third quarter sales,
citing uncertain macroeconomic conditions. The company expects
third-quarter revenues in the range of $41 billion to $43
billion.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apple will beat
earnings estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to
have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to
happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Apple has an Earnings ESP of -2.16% as the Most Accurate Estimate
is $1.36 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at
$1.39.Zacks Rank:Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a
Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings
announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative
estimate revisions.APPLE INC Price and EPS SurpriseAPPLE INC Price and EPS Surprise|APPLE INC QuoteStock to ConsiderHere's a stock worth considering that, as per our model, has the
right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this
quarter:Post Holdings Inc.POSTwith an Earnings ESP of +12.77% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Near a 4-Year Low, Is InvenSense Inc a Buy?;7/20/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The Internet of Things (IoT) -- a world where all of our
  electronic devices can communicate with one another -- was
  supposed to be the Next Big Thing. In a way, it is -- but the
  results for investors who hopped on the IoT train have been
  nothing short of disappointing.makeArticleAd();Consider what's happened toInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) since mid-2014.INVNdata byYCharts.InvenSense is actually near an all-time low since going public
  in 2011. Below, we'll evaluate why the company has fallen, what
  its prospects look like going forward, and what kind of deal we'd
  be getting on shares today.Why has InvenSense so fallen out of favor?Here's the short answer for why InvenSense hasn't panned out
  as an investment: (1) it relies far too much on a few customers
  for its business, and (2) it has yet to really become an IoT
  company. Instead, its motion sensor technology remains the
  dominant source of income.During the company's last fiscal year,Apple(Nasdaq: AAPL) accounted for 40% of net revenue, whileSamsung(Nasdaqoth: SSNLF) chipped in 16%.  That's bad for two
  reasons. First, if someone at either of these companies decided
  to pick a different provider of motion-sensor chips, it would
  spell doom for InvenSense. While InvenSense has the advantage of
  deep relationships with both companies, if the technology the
  company provides is commoditized, Apple or Samsung will choose
  the cheaper, good-enough provider in a heartbeat.Furthermore, even if InvenSense remains in good graces with
  these two, a weak smartphone market-particularly in the high-end
  market-would asymmetrically affect InvenSense. Currently, the
  company's fate is largely tied to trends in the smartphone
  market.InvenSense is trying to do something about that-particularly
  by looking for opportunities in the Internet of Things.
  Management qualifies all things IoT related as part of the
  company's ""IoT & Other"" division. As you can see, it still
  makes up a small part of  the revenue pie.Create column chartsOf course the growth of IoT over the past year-clocking in at
  115%-is very encouraging. Management said this was due
  to,""increased adoption and expansion of a range of consumer
  electronic products in...the IoT market .""But the fact of the matter is that it still accounts for just
  20% of all revenue. And that needs to change to make this a more
  compelling investment.What does the future look like for InvenSense?Over the medium-term, the company will still be heavily
  influenced by smartphone and tablet sales. There's simply no way
  around that. If Apple's next gen phone-likely tabbed the iPhone
  7-is a success, it would be an important win for InvenSense.But even then, it will be crucial for investors to watch gross
  margins. Apple is (in)famous for squeezing suppliers for all they
  are worth, and InvenSense is no exception. In fiscal 2014 ,
  gross margins stood at 49.4%. But over the last twelve months,
  they have shrunk to 41.6%. While management sees margins
  improving to the mid-40% range, such action should give investors
  pause that InvenSense's technology is becoming commoditized.Over the long-run, the continued move into IoT is paramount.
  While no single opportunity in IoT will be as large as
  InvenSense's tie-ups with Apple and Samsung, if the company can
  use its FireFly platform diversify its base of customers, it
  would make the company far less sensitive to the smartphone
  market.Management sees possibilities in a number of
  industries-including drones, virtual reality, augmented reality,
  automotive, wearables and other applications-but success in any
  of those is far from a guarantee.Is it worth it at these prices?Technically, InvenSense is running in the red right now. But
  if we back out some one-time payments and stock-based
  compensation, the company made $0.50 per share. It also brought
  in $75 million in free cash flow (FCF). Given this, it trades for
  a fairly reasonable 13 times earnings and 8 times FCF.But that's not the whole story. The company is only expected
  to earn (non-GAAP) $0.12 per share in the coming year, and that
  equates to a much higher forward P/E of 53.While there's no doubt that InvenSense's stock is cheap right
  now, I would caution to say that it's a buy. The company's path
  to success-keeping margins stable and growing while expanding IoT
  offerings-is pretty clearly defined, the risk of commoditization
  and losing out to well-heeled rivals is huge, and there's not
  much that gives me confidence that InvenSense will be a clear
  winner.I think investors would be better off finding other places for
  their hard-earned cash.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. Reportedly Wins Apple Inc. A11 Orders;7/18/2016;"Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor.According toEconomic Daily News(viaDIGITIMES),Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has chosen Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturerTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(NYSE: TSM) to produce its next-generation iPhone applications
  processor dubbed the A11. More to the point, Taiwan Semiconductor
  is said to be theexclusivemanufacturer of the A11, meaning thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is out of the loop yet again.makeArticleAd();Implications for Taiwan SemiconductorIt had been widely reported that Apple had chosen Taiwan
  Semiconductor exclusively for the A10 that will be inside of this
  year's iPhone 7, something that DIGITIMES reiterated in
  summarizing theEconomic Daily Newsreport. However, it appeared that there was the possibility that
  the A11 would besplitbetween Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, as had been the case
  with the A9 processor found inside of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus.Taiwan Semiconductor, it would seem, was successful in getting
  all of Apple's A11 orders.This actually isn'ttoosurprising in light of comments from TSMC on the company's recent
  earnings call. Management said that it expected to have ""more
  than 70%"" market share at the 10-nanometer node in 2017,
  something that implied at least majority share of the A11 orders,
  if not outright exclusivity.At any rate, if TSMC has won the A11 in its entirety, then the
  chip manufacturer won't have to worry about tough year-over-year
  comparisons from late 2017 through late 2018. In fact, since both
  A10 and A11 are said to be TSMC-exclusive, TSMC should actually
  benefit during the iPhone 8 cycle as it will have the orders for
  the chips that go into both the flagship iPhone as well as the
  discounted prior-generation model.Implications for Samsung foundrySamsung managed to grab a lot of headlines earlier this year
  as it began talking up its own 10-nanometer technology. Although
  I expect Samsung's foundry to have a fairly large captive
  customer in the form of Samsung's own chip design teams, I'm not
  all that optimistic about its chances as a third-party contract
  logic chip manufacturer going forward.Apple's choice of TSMC at the 10-nanometer node seems to
  suggest that TSMC's technology is superior. I say this because
  there were reports in the past (likethis one) claiming that Samsung ""attempted to offer low quotes to obtain
  14nm FinFET foundry orders from Apple in 2015.""I have little doubt that Samsung would also be willing to
  offer attractive pricing on 10-nanometer wafers. That said, if
  the technology doesn't perform as well as Taiwan Semiconductors',
  or if Samsung's manufacturing yields simply aren't up to snuff
  (which would diminish the value of lower wafer prices), I'd
  expect Apple to pass.Samsung has also signaled that 10-nanometer will be a fairly
  long node, with multiple iterations. Taiwan Semiconductor, in
  contrast, has signaled that its 10-nanometer technology will be a
  short node as it aims to transition to a superior 7-nanometer
  technology in 2018.In light of this, I doubt that Samsung will even be in the
  running for Apple's A12, which I expect to be manufactured on
  Taiwan Semiconductors' upcoming 7-nanometer technology.Implications for AppleIt's no secret that Apple tends to like having multiple
  sources for critical components. With TSMC seemingly so ahead of
  its main rival, Samsung, Apple is really down to one viable
  choice to manufacture A-series chips.Apple's sheer scale should still allow it to get good wafer
  pricing from TSMC, but its ability to use Samsung as a
  negotiating tool to gain pricing concessions is likely to
  diminish substantially in the coming generations.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Micron Technology, Inc.: Can MU Stock Come Back From the Dead?;7/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsMicron Technology, Inc.(MU) stock took a pounding the day after the company posted weak
  fiscal-third-quarter earnings, down over 10%.Micron reported revenue of $2.9 billion for the quarter, a
  massive 24.7% year-over-year decline and $60 million below the
  consensus on Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Sales at the chipmaker have been in decline over the past
  seven quarters, though the last quarter was more brutal than
  most. Although the company managed to eke out a penny beat after
  posting non-GAAP EPS of -8 cents vs. an expected loss of 9 cents,
  GAAP net loss of $215 million compared very poorly to the
  year-ago quarter, when the company posted net income of $491
  million.Shrinking Margins for MicronSo Micron stock is now in a severe conundrum where both its
  top and bottom lines are contracting in double-digits.10 Stocks With More Upside Than Apple Inc.
      (AAPL)Investors are, however, typically more concerned about
  Micron's margin trends because they correlate strongly with the
  demand/supply forces in the market.Micron sells two main types of memory products: DRAM and NAND.
  DRAM is a type of memory found predominantly in PCs and mobile
  devices. DRAM is faster than NAND but is volatile - i.e. data is
  lost when the device is powered off.NAND, on the other hand, is a type of memory found solid-state
  drives (SSDs), USBs and memory cards. Unlike DRAM, NAND is
  non-volatile memory that is capable of retaining data even after
  a device loses power.Micron is usually coy about revealing the actual average
  selling price for its products. Nevertheless, it's not hard to
  figure that the company's ASPs are trending south. After all,
  Micron reported that DRAM bit growth during the quarter clocked
  in at 22% yet revenue still fell sharply.DRAM sales accounted for 60% of overall sales during the
  quarter, with NAND bringing in 31% and Other Products accounting
  for the balance. For revenue to have plunged so dramatically, it
  can only mean that DRAM, and possibly NAND, ASPs took another big
  hit.Falling ASPs have taken a big bite off Micron stock and
  margins. Gross margin during the quarter was 17% vs. 31.2% a year
  ago while operating margin clocked in at -7.42% compared to
  12.74% during last year's corresponding quarter.Unfortunately for Micron stock, both DRAM and NAND are highly
  commoditized, which makes it hard for the company to
  differentiate its products from those by its competitors.
  Consequently the company's DRAM and NAND businesses tend to be
  highly cyclical and are dictated by swings in demand and supply.
  2014 and the early part 2015 were good times for the company, and
  its profitability soared.But the markets were soon flooded with too much DRAM, leading
  to a precipitous decline in prices during the latter half of 2015
  and this year. Better factory yields by leading producersSamsung(SSNLF) andSK Hynixare responsible for this state of affairs, as is the refusal by
  smaller Asian manufacturers to trim supply as they look to
  maintain market share.Throw in weak demand due to an anemic PC market that has
  refused to recover and Micron stock is finding itself wedged
  between a rock and hard place.The DRAM oversupply is expected to continue till early 2017
  before things start looking up.Product Transitions and Cost Cutting Might Do the
    TrickMicron, though, still believes that it can manage to overcome
  the vagaries of a weak market through its ongoing product
  transitions. The company is moving from older 25-nanometer and
  30nm DRAM to the newer 20nm, which is in higher demand. Micron
  indicated that it had already achieved 50% crossover success
  during the last quarter.Further, Micron added that the transition from planar NAND to
  3D NAND was exceeding the company's expectations. Micron is ahead
  of many of its peers in the transition to 3D NAND and might be
  among the first companies to benefit when demand takes off.Meanwhile, Micron's 3D XPoint, that it jointly developed withIntel Corporation(INTC), remains a wildcard but with good potential to drive future
  growth for the company. 3D XPoint is a non-volatile memory just
  like NAND but is much faster and more durable than NAND. The
  product can either replace DRAM, NAND, or be used as a middle
  layer between the two.The potential applications of the new architecture are
  numerous, and Micron CEO Mike Durcanexpects the productto bring in as much as $5 billion for the company in 2018, or
  about half the company's DRAM revenue at the time.Over the short-to-medium term, the fortunes of MU stock are
  likely to be largely dictated by margin improvements. Micron is
  likely to achieve this through a mixture of global job cuts and
  lowering in 3D NAND manufacturing costs. Micron expects to
  realize cost savings of $300 million in 2017, which could give a
  nice boost to its battered bottom line.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock: THIS Is the Apple
      You're Buying NowMeanwhile, Micron stock has surged as much as 6% over the past
  five days after HDD manufacturersSilicon Motion Technology Corp. (ADR)(SIMO),Western Digital Corp(WDC) andSeagate Technology PLC(STX) issued upbeat guidance. Although it's still too early for
  memory investors to do a victory lap, the fact that that WDC and
  STX - the two largest players in the industry - are involved here
  is a positive sign.Maybe we, after all, are beginning to see the early innings of
  the much-touted PC recovery.And Micron stock is likely to shake off the effects of its
  latest earnings wipeout, and looks like a good long-term bet from
  here.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any
    of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $107 Junior Gold Miners That Will Climb 20% or

  least two things that could put it back on track. Let's run
  through what might help InvenSense get its footing again.InvenSense finally realizes its IoT potentialInvenSense has made some huge gains in shifting its focus from
  mobile to the Internet of Things (IoT) -- and revenue has
  followed.On the company's Q4 earnings call, CEO Behrooz Abdi said:We more than doubled our IoT and other revenue in fiscal
    2016 with market-leading solutions for key emerging platforms
    such as drones, virtual and augmented reality, wearables,
    automotive and a variety of smart home, enterprise, and
    industrial applications.The revenue increase in InvenSense's ""other"" segment increased
  from 21% of total revenue in Q3 to 32% in Q4. That increase is a
  welcomed change as the company attempts to move away from its
  mobile dependence.But it'll take more of the same for InvenSense to see a huge
  change in the company's revenue diversification. Apple and
  Samsung still made up about 56% of the company's total
  revenue in fiscal 2016.Still, the Internet of Things holds massive opportunity for
  the company. The entire IoT market size is estimated to be worth
  $7.1 trillion by 2020. And Grandview Research projects the MEMS
  market to reach $26 billion by 2022. If InvenSense can continue
  expanding its IoT revenue quickly, investors might still be able
  to see the company turnaround.Blowout iPhone salesIt's critical InvenSense move away from its dependence on
  Apple (and the quicker the better). But as it does that, strong
  iPhone sales could still help InvenSense. When Apple reported its
  first-ever year-over-year iPhone sale decline last quarter,
  InvenSense suffered along with it.The iPhone maker accounts for about 40% of InvenSense's total
  revenue in fiscal 2016. There's no way InvenSense will simply
  drop Apple as a customer (though Apple could certainly drop
  InvenSense), so it's best for InvenSense if Apple's devices are
  flying off the shelves.Of course, this doesn't mean InvenSense should just hunker
  down and bet the farm on what Apple's doing. It needs to grow
  other revenue sources. But as it does, strong iPhone sales could
  help the company earn the revenue it needs to make investments in
  other businesses.This is going to be a tough one for Apple to pull off, though.
  KGI securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has put the worst-case
  scenario for iPhone shipments at just 190 million (that would be
  lower than the company's 2014 iPhone sales).At least one estimate is betting on Apple, though. BMO Capital
  Markets analyst Tim Long says historical iPhone upgrade cycles
  indicate that this year's device will surpass previous upgrades,
  and that 120 million devices fall within the normal upgrade
  timelines for Apple iPhone users.Additionally,Wells Fargoanalyst Maynard Um recently said Apple is asking its suppliers to
  produce 72 million to 78 million new iPhones for 2016. If true,
  that would the highest production of iPhone units for Apple in
  the past two years.These are all guesses, of course. But InvenSense might see
  some of its mobile revenues rise (and then use them to continue
  making its mobile exit) if Apple pulls off an unexpected iPhone
  win.Investor takeawayI have to be honest, here: I don't think InvenSense's
  turnaround is going to happen any time soon. Selling components
  to mobile players is still the company's biggest moneymaker and
  it'll take a while for that to change. And even if InvenSense
  goes all-in with the IoT, there's still no guaranteed success in
  the market.Additionally, InvenSense has been an Apple supplier during the
  iPhone boom times and hasstillseen its stock price crumble. Huge demand for the next iteration
  of the device (or even the one after that) might not be enough to
  put InvenSense's revenue or stock price back on track. Remember
  that Apple's been able to put pricing pressure on InvenSense for
  quite a while because of its large percentage of business. And
  this could weigh down InvenSense's margins even if the next
  iPhone is successful.So, while it's possible the above two scenarioscouldhelp InvenSense get back on track, I think the company is still
  too big of a risk for investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Nintendo: It's HUUUUGE (Part 1) - Monetization Of Pokemon Go;7/17/2016;"ByMaks Financial Services:I can finally admit, my childhood best friend was right...
Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) beats Sega. =)I am a 33-year-old millennial, professional, who started my own
investment advisory practice after years at Ameriprise Financial
(AMPF) and UBS (NYSE:UBS). I do not own any current generation video consoles nor do I
consider myself a gamer. The last console I purchased was a Sega
Dreamcast more than 10 years ago, on clearance.So when a few days ago my wife asked me if I heard anything
about some Pokemon thing that her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) timeline was littered with, I genuinely had no idea, replied ""No""
and moved on.makeArticleAd();Over the next 24 hours I had seen numerous Pokemon Go articles
on television, radio and newspaper; countless posts on Twitter; and
comments in real life from friends whom I did not even know had
played video games.What really took me by surprise were comments such as ""Nintendo
gained nearly the entire market cap of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) since launching Pokemon Go,"" and ""Pokemon added as many users in
5 days as it took Instagram over a year to do.""Such massive claims were too big to pass up investigating so I
took the plunge and download Pokemon Go and spent the next 48 hours
playing the game. What I can say now is... it's ""HUGE.""I will discuss in future articles the major impacts that this
game can have socially, such as encouraging fitness and mental
wellness among children, but for now I wanted to focus on the
monetization of the Pokemon Go, beyond in-app purchases, that the
majority have overlooked or chosen to ignore.5 Monetization Factors That Are Not Being Taken Into
  Account1. Sponsored ""PokeSpots"" and ""Gyms""There are countless articles in the media about small businesses
that have seen double digit growth as they were lucky to be located
next to a PokeSpot or a Gym. CNBC has a great article about ithere.If you have not played the game, PokeSpots and Gyms are
important -- no, critical -- to the game.Players go to PokeSpots in order to spin the sign to get free
items used in the game, such as balls to capture Pokemon and
potions to revive them. They may even be lucky to catch a few eggs
that will spawn into Pokemon characters after the player walks
between 2 and 10 kilometers.Gyms are a place where you train and battle Pokemon.In both cases, you must be in proximity to those locations to
use them.As I am writing this, I am sitting at a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), right in between 2 PokeSpots, working on this article. There are
currently at least 3 people here, besides me, playing Pokemon Go,
all of whom paid $5 or more for a beverage.Currently there is no way for a business to be added as a
PokeSpot, the question is... how many small business owners would
have ZERO qualms about paying $100, $200, $500 or $1,000 per month
in order to have a PokeSpot at their business, or more importantly,
their business made a PokeSpot.In signs that this may be happening, a Reddit user looking at
the code noticed references to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) in the game code. While it is not known if this was a deal per
say or if this was simply an errant McDonald's near a PokeSpot, how
much of a big deal would it be if someone forward thinking like
McDonald's or Starbucks signed a deal to have a Gym located at
their establishment, where they can offer discounts to the team in
control of their Gym, etc.There is proof that large corporations are taking this
seriously. Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) has put up a great in-depth guide to playing Pokemon Go in its
parks, which you can findhere.Side note... Make that 6 people playing now. A mother and her two daughters
just sat down next to me playing.What's really funny and perfectly makes my point... the young
girl just said...""Mommy, let's stay here, there are lots of PokeSpots
around.""2. In-Game Advertising & OffersBeyond PokeSpots and Gyms, think of the opportunities for
businesses were geo-local advertising available when a user walks
by their store.Companies are already doing it on apps such as FourSquare, a
social media platform, and Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic and
navigation app.If you are a small business owner in NYC, or heck, even a small
downtown area, do you think more people are currently using
FourSquare or will be playing Pokemon Go? Wouldn't you be
interested in having a message with Pokemon Go specials sent to
users, called ""trainers,"" that are walking by your establishment or
say in a one-quarter-mile vicinity?Here, you can apply a number of payment options, cost per click,
cost per view, or cost per acquisition.3. Licensing of Pokemon CharactersIt would be extremely silly if you do not believe downloads of
Pokemon Go will not turn into sales of Pokemon merchandise, movie
tickets, existing games and other ventures.Pokemon is a huge global brand, with extremely high recognition
likely on par with Star Wars. By looking at theStar Wars numbers, it is not too hard to believe that Pokemon can generate $500
million or more in licensing fees.Furthermore, as the Pokemon franchise grows and individual
characters gain new following and recognition, we can start
comparing individual Pokemon monsters to Marvel's comic book
heroes.4. Hardware Sales & PartnershipsIf you are a parent, or are at least 30 years old, it is not
surprising that so many kids today are obese and socially
insecure.For the most part, their entertainment has been an X-Box or a
PlayStation attached to their TVs. First person shooters and other
violent games have been blamed for challenges in mental health,
social anxiety and awkwardness.Pokemon Go is a game where you MUST go outside and PLAY if you
want to get ahead.More than that, the majority of the PokeSpots and Gyms are at
community centers and historical spots, as well as local parks and
college campuses.Not only will children... ok and adults, get a good workout, but
they will also learn about their community and its history.Nintendo has announced aPokemon Go Plus devicewhich you can use on the go that will notify you of nearby Pokemon
by vibrating. It will further allow you to capture them without
having to look at your phone if you ran across them in the
past.While this would be a great device for anyone playing the game,
an even better extension would be a partnership with wearables
makers such as FitBit (NYSE:FIT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with the Apple Watch, Samsung's Gear (SSNLF) or even Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) or Garmin (GRMN) to create a fitness tracker that integrates with the game.If you visit the reddit groups, you will find many fitness
people combining their regular runs/jogs/walks with Pokemon Go.Over the last two days, inspired by the game, I did a 2 and a
3.5 mile run outside looking for Pokemon, rather than doing a
cardio class at the gym or hitting the treadmill.Thinking bigger, sporting goods retailers can create Pokemon
Go-inspired campaigns to take advantage of the craze.The reality is, many people take their Pokemon Go hunting
seriously. Just look at this YouTube video showing a stampede in
Central Park.Finally....#5. Apply the Pokemon Go Augmented Reality Model To The
  Rest Of The Nintendo CatalogYes... Pokemon is a BIG franchise but in time... it may not be
the most popular thing out there. Then again... the Facebook fad is
still here and Pokemon Go picked up a lot more users in the week it
has been out than Facebook did in its history.The real story here is that this mobile game model is being
proven with Pokemon. Where there is perhaps even more money and
opportunity is in applying this model to the rest of Nintendo's
catalog.Can you imagine running around through your town on a Zelda
quest? It would be the LARGEST MASSIVE Multi Player Role Playing
game.What about walking down the street dodging barrels thrown at you
by Donkey Kong?Last and certainly not least... how many ways can you imagine of
bringing Mario Brothers to life?Our Take & Bottom LineWhat Nintendo and partners have accomplished here is nothing
short of game changing, pun intended.Pokemon Go represents the pinnacle of ""video games"" that every
parent can be proud of. It is a clean video game that can be
enjoyed by anyone of any age, without profanity or excess violence.
Most of all, if you want to succeed, you are going to get up, off
of the sofa and go OUTSIDE and play.For anyone socially awkward, you have an easy avenue to talk to
others and build bonds over something you both enjoy -- the hunt
for pocket monsters.It is a franchise that is a WIN WIN WIN for everyone involved. A
win for the players spending quality time outside and socializing
while getting fit at the same time. It is an opportunity for
parents to spend time with their children to bond and explore the
local community and perhaps uncover little known facts hidden away
through the history of time. It is a win for small business in the
communities who have more people coming in to visit their
establishments, and most of all, it is a win for Nintendo and its
shareholders.The final question that remains is exactly who will profit from
Pokemon Go and the add on sales. Is Nintendo the only player or are
there others?Pokemon Go is a joint development between Niantic Labs and
Pokemon Co.Niantic is the developer and distributor of the game, while
Pokemon Co is the producer of the game.Originally, Niantic was part of Google and later spun off. In
2015, they raised equity, with Pokemon Co, Google and Nintendo
being the investors.Nintendo further owns between 32% and 33% of Pokemon Co.For all of the game-related revenues, Nintendo is exposed two
ways, through its ownership in Niantic, as well as its 33% stake in
Pokemon Co.For all of the licensing, Nintendo would earn revenues through
its one-third ownership of Pokemon Co.Finally, for the hardware side, such as for the Pokemon Go Plus
device, Nintendo is seemingly earning all of the revenue for
itself.I believe that what Pokemon Go represents is the evolution of
video games, much like the MP3 format and what Apple iTunes has
done for the music and recording industry.It is my intention to purchase shares of Nintendo across various
accounts for both short- and long-term purposes over the next week,
after publication.For direct revenues from Pokemon Go and the rest of the Pokemon
franchise, Nintendo is the most direct way to go, particularly as
the vast majority of investors are not able to buy directly into
Niantic or Pokemon Co.Another way of playing this craze would be buying Apple or
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for their share of in-app purchasing.Finally, for a more speculative investment thesis, you could
invest in businesses that would potentially benefit from this
Pokemon craze, such as potential partners like McDonald's and
Starbucks for food, or at least more Pokemon players coming in to
play the game. You can go out further and invest in fitness apparel
producers such as Nike and retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Dicks Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Big 5 Sporting Goods (NASDAQ:BGFV).Final Note: I hope you found this article helpful. I am a

Mark Your Calendars: Skyworks Solutions Inc Earnings July 21;7/17/2016;"Image source: Getty imagesMuch digital ink has been spilled about the industrywide
  slowdown in smartphone sales, particularly the iPhone. That fact
  is putting a lot of pressure on every company that counts itself
  as anApplesupplier, which includesSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) .makeArticleAd();Analysts have been cutting the company's earning estimates
  over the last few months, and a few have even downgraded their
  rating on the company's stock. Understandably, those moves
  have caused Skyworks' share price to trade erratically, with the
  end result being that shares are currently down more than
  12% since the start of the year.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the company set to report results from its fiscal third
  quarter on July 21, here are a few areas that I'd suggest
  investors pay attention to.The headline numbersSkyworks' management team provides a forecast of what to
  expect from the company each quarter. For years, the company has
  been guiding for upbeat results, and Skyworks has a history
  of outperforming even those bullish expectations.However, the company isn't feeling great about its
  prospects for this quarter and actually shared some downbeat
  news. Here's a look at what the company believes will happen
  this quarter:MetricQ3 2016Q3 2015Change %Revenue$750 million$810 million(7.4%)Non-GAAP EPS$1.21$1.34(9.7%)Data source: SkyworksAs you can see, the iPhone slowdown is going to take quite a
    toll on the company's financial statements. That's particularly
    true when you consider that Skyworks revenue from its
    non-iPhone product lines are still growing bydouble digits.Investors will want to compare the company's actual results
    against this forecast to see how the company is faring in
    this challenging time.New design wins?In an effort to reduce its dependence on the iPhone, Skyworks
  has wisely been building out its business in a number of new and
  growing markets over the past few years. The company is pushing
  hard to become a leader in the Internet of Things trend, and each
  quarter usually brings announcements of new design wins in a
  range of growth industries.In the recent past we've seen wins in smartwatches, smart TVs,
  industrial GPS tracking devices, and more. Last quarter we
  even saw the company expand its presence with other smartphone
  providers likeSamsung.Image source: SkyworksShareholders should keep their ears open to see if the company
  was successful in its efforts to expand its reach into new
  markets yet again.More buybacks?With Skyworks' share price down significantly from its 52-week
  high it will be interesting to see if the company once again
  ramped up its share repurchase efforts. We saw that happen
  last quarter when management bought back more than 2 million
  shares for an average price of $67.50.The company's shares have consistently traded well below that
  figure since its last reported earnings were released, so it's
  not hard to believe that the company once again retired a ton of
  shares. After all, as of April 1 the company had more than $1.1
  billion in cash on its books and no debt, so it's not like the
  company can't afford it.Better times ahead?Finally, investors will want to know if the worst of the
  decline is in the past, or if the upcoming quarter will be
  another painful one.The markets currently aren't expecting much. Consensus
  forecast for revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter is only $831
  million, which would represent a year-over-year decline of more
  than 5%. That's an improvement over the 7% decline that's
  expected this quarter, but still not what investors want to
  see.How will the company perform in these few areas? We'll have
  answers on July 21..A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,
    but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:

Understanding InvenSense Inc.;7/14/2016;"Image source: InvenSense.Motion processor specialistInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) has had a rough year so far, with shares tumbling
  about 37% year-to-date as of the July 12 close.makeArticleAd();INVNdata byYChartsThe company found significant success in providing high
  performance motion processors to makers of premium smartphones,
  enjoying both a strong share position in such devices as well as
  the secular growth of that market.Recently, however, the high end smartphone market has soured,
  which has led the company to suffer from year-over-year revenue
  declines in recent quarters. On top of that, InvenSenselost shareinSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recently launched, and fairly successful
  Galaxy S7 flagship phone.InvenSense has been working to diversify its business beyond
  smartphones. The company cites non-smartphone applications such
  as fitness trackers, automotive, drones, and virtual reality
  headsets as potential opportunities.Making progress, but still a smartphone-centric
    businessLast quarter, InvenSense reported that 54% of its revenue came
  from smartphones and tablets. Optical image stabilization modules
  worked out to 14% of total revenue. And, finally, the rest of the
  company's business (which CFO Mark Dentinger said includes
  Internet of Things revenue) came in at 32%.In the prior fiscal quarter, these figures were 65%, 14%, and
  21%, respectively. On the surface these figures would seem to
  imply that InvenSense's attempts to diversify its business are
  working, but let's take a look at the raw dollar figures from
  each segment to get a better picture of what's going on:SegmentFiscal Q3(in millions of $)Fiscal Q4 (in millions of $)Total Revenue120.0379.53Phone & Tablet78.0242.94OIS16.811.13All Other (includes IoT)25.225.45Data source: InvenSense, author calculations.On a sequential basis, InvenSense's all other (including
  Internet of Things) business made up a much larger percentage of
  its total business than it did in the prior quarter primarily
  because phone, tablet, and optical image stabilization revenue
  declined sharply.If we assume that InvenSense has been designed into the next
  iPhone, the company should soon start seeing an uptick in orders
  for phone-bound components. Barring a dramatic uptick in ""all
  other"" revenue, I would expect that InvenSense is going to see
  its revenue mix shift pretty dramatically toward its phone and
  tablet segments sequentially.Key drivers for the business, stockIn the near-to-medium term, InvenSense's business is likely to
  trend withApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) . If the next generation iPhone, likely to be
  called iPhone 7, does well in the marketplace (the iPhone
  6s-series proved disappointing following a strong iPhone 6
  cycle), then I would expect good things for InvenSense's
  financial results.However, if the iPhone 7 fails to stimulate growth or even
  sees shipmentdeclinesrelative to the prior model, then InvenSense's financials and
  potentially its stock price, could remain stuck in the
  doldrums.Longer-term, the company will need to continue to hunt for
  opportunities outside of the smartphone market. The smartphone
  opportunity has proven unique because of the sheer volumes of
  phones, even high end ones, that sell each year.I doubt that there will be any one such opportunity in the
  so-called ""Internet of Things"" market that will be as large as
  smartphones. Instead, InvenSense is going to have to go after
  many smaller opportunities that, if the company is lucky, will
  add up to substantial enough revenue to allow the company to more
  easily withstand the ebbs and flows of the smartphone market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

  moved on from them. It's as if our highest elected officials were
  forced to wear Crocs while saying ""talk to the hand,"" long after
  any self-respecting person would have done either.makeArticleAd();Even as BlackBerry fell to about 0.2%global market sharein Q1 of this year 2016, the company maintained its government
  contracts. This put politicians like Hillary Clinton and
  President Barack Obama -- along with the United States Senate --
  in a position where, while regular citizens could embrace the
  latestApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone orSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy device, our top leaders had to carry
  around 2007's must-have phone.Finally, however, that has changed and the U.S. Senate has
  sent a memo to the staff of its members which opens the door for
  Apple and Samsung.What does the memo say?The changes being implemented in the Senate phone policy will
  move U.S. senators from being the guys and gals still doing
  Austin Powers impressions or talking like Borat to something a
  little more modern (perhaps quoting Kevin Hart jokes). It's a
  big, long-overdue move that ends an era.BlackBerry, which peaked with just-over 20% global market
  share in 2009, had held onto government contracts due to its
  well-earned reputation for security. That continued in recent
  years even as the company lost its stranglehold on business users
  and largely transitioned away from phones into software.In thepolicy memo, which Politico published in its entirety, the Mobile
  Communications Services office said that it had been informed
  that BlackBerry has discontinued all OS 10 devices (Q10,Z10, Z30,
  Passport, and Classic). The company later denied that it has
  discontinued the OS 10 phone in a statement toCrackBerry, but that does not change that senators can now use certain
  Apple and Samsung models.The memo from Mobile Communications Services noted that
  BlackBerry ""is committed to maintaining their support of our
  devices to include uninterrupted warranty and technical support.""
  It also noted that it had limited stock of the BlackBerry devices
  and pointed out that ""offices wishing to make the transition from
  BlackBerry devices to other platforms"" could switch to Samsung's
  S6 models or iPhones (with the new iPhone SE being
  mentioned).Nothing was specified in the memo as to whether the newer
  Samsung S7 phones are supported or if higher-end iPhones could be
  used.This is not the end for BlackBerryWhile nostalgia or a desire to recapture past glory has kept
  the company in the phone business, BlackBerry has been working
  for years to transition away from that market. CEO John Chen has
  openly talked about being willing to exit the phone market and he
  seemed frustrated at the company's continued identification with
  a product line which is no longer its core offering, Reuters
  reported.""Despite my best efforts to tell the world I'm a lot more than
  just a phone company, every question I ever get is about phones,""
  Chen said in late June.He did note that he expected to meet a self-imposed September
  deadline to make the company's handset division profitable.
  BlackBerry made slightly more software and licensing revenue
  ($166 million) in its fiscalQ1 2017(ended May 31, 2016) than it did device revenue ($152 million).
  The company now offers a phone running Android and Chen has said
  he is willing to license its handset technology rather than
  manufacturing it on its own.The loss of U.S. government exclusivity, however, marks the
  final domino falling in what was once an impressive empire. It's
  hard to remember, but before iPhone became something people lined
  up for in advance of a new model's release, having a BlackBerry
  was a status symbol.Long after it lost that status it kept its reputation for
  security, which made it the official phone of the U.S. government
  (though it was never actually called that). Now, while BlackBerry
  handsets may exist in some fashion, another nail has been placed
  in the coffin of the company's proprietary operating system. It
  was a good run, one that maybe should have gone on longer, but
  the BlackBerry as an elite phone is now no more, with its last
  bastion of exclusivity finally falling.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

NVIDIA Corporation's GTX 1060 Details Leak;7/4/2016;"A spy shot of the GeForce GTX 1060. Image source:
  BenchLife.info.Graphics specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) is expected to launch its next generation
  mid-range desktop graphics processor, known as the GeForce GTX
  1060, sometime this month. Though the general launch time frame
  had been leaked, the specifications and expected performance of
  the card weren't known.makeArticleAd();Thanks to aleakof some slides that look as though they were produced by NVIDIA
  from graphics card focused website VideoCardz.com, we now know
  the key details of this upcoming card. Let's take a closer
  look.Smaller PascalAccording to the leak, the GeForce GTX 1060 packs 1280 CUDA
  cores, exactly one-half of the number of CUDA cores found inside
  of NVIDIA's flagship GeForce GTX 1080, running at a boost speed
  of 1.7GHz. It also comes with six gigabytes of GDDR5 memory rated
  at 8Gbps speeds. Assuming a memory bus width of 192-bits,
  VideoCardz calculates the memory bandwidth available to the GPU
  at 192 gigabytes per second -- 60% of the bandwidth available to
  the GTX 1080.One of theslidesthat VideoCardz shows reads, ""the power of GTX 980 for every
  gamer,"" which likely means that in terms of performance, the 1060
  will be as fast as NVIDIA's late-2014 flagship GPU, the GeForce
  GTX 980.The card itself uses a single six-pin PCI Express power
  connector and is rated at a 120 watt thermal design power. This
  means that the card is much more efficient than the GeForce GTX
  980 (rated at 165 watts and required two six pin power
  connectors), something that will make life easier for users
  trying to upgrade systems with relatively low quality power
  supplies.In terms of display connectors, the slide shows that the GTX
  1060 packs three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, an HDMI 2.0B output, as
  well as a dual-link DVI connector. This should ensure
  compatibility with a wide range of displays.Cost reduced GTX 980I believe that if the GTX 1060 is able to hit GeForce GTX 980
  level performance across the board at the rumored price of $299,
  it should do well in the marketplace. What's important to note,
  though, is that the GeForce GTX 1060 should be cheaper to produce
  than the GTX 970/980, so NVIDIA should be better off bringing
  this part to market than selling dramatically price reduced GTX
  980s into this market.Let's explore this a little bit more.The GTX 980 was built onTSMC's(NYSE: TSM) 28-nanometer process and measured in at 398 square
  millimeters. The GTX 1060, assuming it's based on the GP106 chip,
  is estimated to measure in at somewhere between 170 square
  millimeters and 200 square millimeters on TSMC's newer
  16-nanometer FinFET process (thisestimatecomes from VideoCardz.com as well). Let's call it 200 square
  millimeters to err on the side of caution.Analyst Handel Jonesestimatesthat a 16-nanometer wafer in late 2016 should run about 70% more
  than a 28-nanometer wafer by the end of 2014, implying a 70%
  increase in cost per area. If we take this estimate to be true,
  this should imply that a 200 square millimeter GTX 1060 chip
  should actually cost less to manufacture than a 398 square
  millimeter GTX 980. It's also worth noting that, all else equal,
  smaller chips tend to yield better than larger chips.From a raw die cost perspective, it would seem that the
  GTX 1060 should be cheaper to make than the GeForce GTX 980.Beyond the die cost, the board should also be cheaper to make.
  The GTX 1060 has a narrower memory bus than the GTX 980 (192-bit
  versus 256-bit), which should lead to a reduction in complexity
  of the board that the graphics processor is mounted on.
  Additionally, the GTX 1060 requires less power than the GTX 980
  does (120 watts versus 165 watts), which should allow NVIDIA and
  board partners to use less expensive power delivery systems and
  save on a PCI Express power connector.The only area where cost could increase is on the memory chip
  side of things; the GTX 980 comes with just four gigabytes of
  GDDR5 while the GTX 1060 should come with six gigabytes. That
  said, the GTX 980 launchedbeforeSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) announced the mass production of 8 gigabit
  GDDR5 memory chips.Samsung claimed in its January 2015 press release that its 8
  gigabit GDDR5 chips were the ""industry's first."" Generally
  speaking, higher density memory chips tend to lead to lower cost
  per bit. In light of this, the six gigabytes of memory on the GTX
  1060 may wind up no more expensive (or possibly even cheaper)
  than the four gigabytes of memory on the GTX 970/980.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

The Rio Olympics Are Jumping Into Virtual Reality -- And That's Good News for Facebook and Samsung;7/2/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.TheAssociated Pressrecently reported (publishedby ABC) that the Rio Olympics will provide up to 85 hours in
  virtual reality (VR), including the open and closing ceremonies,
  men's basketball, track and field, boxing, beach volleyball,
  fencing, diving, and gymnastics. The content will be filmed
  by the Olympic Broadcasting Services and sent out on delay during
  the games.The AP said the content will only be available onSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear VR headset, which is made in part byFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus.makeArticleAd();The move is part of a growing trend to incorporate VR into
  sports content, and it could pay off for both companies.Why Samsung's dominating the VR sports world right nowSamsung's VR win for the Olympics isn't all that surprising
  for a number of reasons. First, Samsung is the official
  smartphone sponsor for the Rio Olympics. So using that
  partnership to bring VR into the mix probably wasn't much of a
  stretch.Secondly, Samsung's headset costs just $99, compared to the
  Oculus' $600 price tag. The Gear VR is cheaper, in part, because
  it's powered by Samsung phones as opposed tapping into a high-end
  PC. That also makes it less of a true VR experience, but being
  that these are the nascent days of VR that probably doesn't
  matter much to users.Lastly, the Gear VR has already proved itself in a number of
  sports broadcasts. Fox Sports broadcasted the Daytona 500 in VR
  and NBC did the same with the most recent Kentucky Derby, and
  both were only available on Samsung's headset.Because Samsung's Gear VR is made in collaboration with
  Oculus, the two companies aren't in competition in the VR headset
  space right now. But the fact that a number of sports VR content,
  and now the Olympics, are being made available to Samsung's
  lower-end headset (as opposed to Oculus' higher-end device) shows
  that Facebook may still have to wait a long time to see benefits
  of its $2 billion purchase.But there's plenty of opportunity for both companies if VR
  continues to grow among sports viewers.The VR sports opportunityFox Sports recently signed a five-year deal to bring more
  sports VR content to its viewers. The deal shows the growing
  interest among broadcasters to try to benefit from the the
  technology.A recentblog post by the research firm Kzero said, ""We expect the sports
  streaming segment to be a key new genre for consumer VR and
  importantly, we expect this genre to be highly monetisable as
  consumers (read fans) show a willingness to pay for new premium
  content.""Of course, broadcasters aren't the only ones that will benefit
  from this. Samsung is already expected to sell 5 million of its
  Gear VR headsets worldwide this year and already 1 million people
  used it in in the month of April. Facebook's Oculus is expected
  to sell as many as 3.6 million units this year,  though some
  analysts have projected numbers as low as the hundreds of
  thousands.But those numbers don't quite reflect virtual reality's future
  opportunity. VR hardware sales are projected to increase from
  $2.86 billion this year to $40.26 billion by 2020, according to
  research from SuperData. The VR headset market alone is expected
  to grow from $900 million this year to $21.25 billion by 2020,
  according to Gartner.The popular sports industry appears to be a unique way of
  bringing VR into the hands of consumers, though it's still
  unclear just how important it could be in driving hardware sales
  growth for Facebook's Oculus and Samsung. Remember
  that Facebook CFO David Wehner said earlier this
  year that, ""VR will not have a material impact on revenue in
  2016.""For now, investors should consider the addition of virtual
  reality into the Olympics and other sporting events as a good
  start to what could become a key industry for VR -- it just make
  take a while.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Apple May Be Buying Jay Z's Tidal Music Service;7/1/2016;"Apple Inc.AAPLis reportedly in talks to acquire rapper and mogul Jay Z's music
streaming service Tidal, according to theWall Street Journal. TheJournalcites people familiar with the matter, who said that deal talks are
ongoing. Jay Z bought Tidal in 2015 for $56 million from Swedish
company Aspiro.It appears that Apple is exploring the idea in order to boost
its Apple Music streaming service, as Tidal has strong ties with
artists like Kanye West, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Madonna. West,
Beyoncé, and Rihanna all released their latest albums-The Life of Pablo,Lemonade, andAnti, respectively-on Tidal exclusively, at least for the first few
weeks.At first look, it doesn't seem that a Tidal acquisition is the
smartest business move for Apple. Recently, the company has
experienced abrupt changes in management, going through three chief
executives in less than a year, with one being interim and one
appointed by previous management. Former chief business officer of
SoundCloud Jeff Toig has held the CEO position since January. Tidal
is also dealing with some lawsuits concerning artist royalties and
exclusivity deals.However, when you look back at Apple's purchase of Beats, a
Tidal acquisition starts to make sense. In 2014, the tech giant
shelled out a whopping $3 billion to buy Beats, a luxe headphone
maker and streaming music service founded by hip-hop producer Dr.
Dre. The streaming service essentially turned into Apple Music, but
Apple also got valuable music industry knowledge and connections-in
addition to Dr. Dre, legendary music mogul Jimmy Iovine-with the
deal.If Apple were to make a bid for Tidal, the company wouldn't have
to face that much competition. SamsungSSNLF, who after months of rumored talks,backed awayfrom a potential deal to buy the service, and Spotify, another
streaming giant, most likely can't afford such a takeover. Alphabet
Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle division would be the next logical buyer if Apple passes, as
their streaming music service would benefit from Tidal's coveted
library (Tidal is the only service to have the bulk of late music
icon Prince's expansive catalogue).But Apple may want to hold off on any talks of buying Tidal for
the moment. Spotify has recentlygone public with accusations, in a letter from its general counsel Horacio Gutierrez, claiming
that Apple is ""'causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers' by
rejecting an update to Spotify's iOS app,"" according toRecode. This could possibly lead to antitrust activity, so it may be in
Apple's best interest to lay low and dodge what appears to be a
consolidating move of the streaming industry.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVIDIA Corporation's Next King Might Launch Next Quarter;6/30/2016;"Image source: NVIDIA.I have written quite extensively about graphics specialistNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) upcoming ultra-high end graphics chip known asGP102. We know that the company has this product in the works, and we
  even know that the chip has ""taped out"" (meaning that the design
  has been completed). What we don't know is when exactly the
  company intends to launch it.makeArticleAd();According to a post from a user over on the Beyond3D forums,
  GP102 may actually launch fairly soon.Potentially arriving next quarterUser Erinyes on the Beyond3D forums claims that ""both GP102
  and GP106 will be out next quarter."" Erinyes does not name
  sources, but this poster's track record actually appears to be
  quite solid.Back in May 2015, when rumors were floating around that NVIDIA
  might tapSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) to manufacture its next generation Tegra
  processor codenamed Parker, the user claimed that it would
  actually be built onTSMC's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanometer FinFET process. That user also said
  that Parker would use NVIDIA's custom Denver CPU cores rather
  thanARM's(NASDAQ: ARMH) Cortex A72, another tidbit that wound up being
  correct.Then, in June of 2015, the user claimed that NVIDIA's GP100
  chip, which powers the recently announced Tesla P100
  accelerators, had taped out -- meaning that the design was
  complete. It often takes about a year to go from tape-out to mass
  production, and given that the parts were in production as of
  NVIDIA's May earnings call, it would seem that this information
  was good.Finally, the user claimed that NVIDIA's next generation
  graphics processors would be built at TSMC and not at Samsung as
  rumored, something that once again proved true.I don't know who this user is, but her/his track record
  appears to be excellent when it comes to future NVIDIA
  products.Strike while the iron is hot; I like itNVIDIA's revenue growth story in gaming has been driven by two
  major factors: unit growth as well as an increase in average
  selling prices, as the slide below shows.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA can drive average selling prices up as long as it
  delivers products that deliver extremely high performance. So,
  for example, if GP102 winds up being approximately 33% faster
  than the GP104-based GeForce GTX 1080, then the company should be
  able to charge at least 33% more while still offering a
  compelling performance-per-dollar.Note that the premium that NVIDIA can charge for GP102
  relative to GP104 depends significantly onwhenit releases it. If GP102 is released about a quarter after GP104
  is, then the company should have little issue getting paid a
  premium at least equivalent to the incremental performance that
  it delivers.If GP102 were to arrive, say, 6-12 months after GP104, then
  the premium that it can charge will likely come down,
  particularly if competitive pressures become greater in that
  time.At any rate, if NVIDIA can get GP102 out within the next 2-3
  months, likely as an ultra-enthusiast product under its Titan
  branding, then this should have a positive impact on the
  company's average selling prices and gross margins.If all of the Pascal chips come in 2016, then might we
    see Volta in 2017?If NVIDIA is able to pull off getting the entire high-end
  Pascal lineup out to consumers during 2016, then I have to wonder
  about when we might expect the company to roll out its
  Volta-based graphics processors.NVIDIA's (admittedly very vague) most recent product road map
  from GTC 2016 shows Volta arriving sometime in late 2017 or in
  2018:Image source: NVIDIA.If NVIDIA rolls out all of its high-end Pascal parts in 2016,
  then it's likely going to needsomethingto launch in 2017 in order to keep the momentum going. Perhaps

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY): No, Seriously. Get Out of Phones NOW!;6/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week,BlackBerry Ltd(BBRY) releasedearnings resultsfor its first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and while the figures
were essentially flat they were stillbetter than analyst expectations.Source: BlackBerrySince January, BlackBerry stock is down more than 30%, and
revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 fell 39% to
$400 million primarily due to plunging handset sales.makeArticleAd();Total handset sales for BBRY's first fiscal quarter barely
reached 500,000, down 16.7% from Q4 2016's total of 600,000 which
itself was down 14.3% from Q3 2016's total of 700,000.To put it another way, BlackBerry's phone sales have tanked
28.6% over the past three quarters. Even the company's most recent
device, the Priv - which has been called""the best BlackBerry in a decade""and sports Android and a touchscreen that slides up to reveal the
iconic BlackBerry QWERTY keyboard - couldn't boost sales
figures.7 Tech Stock Wonders to Buy During the 'Brexit'
    SelloffCEO John Chen has apparently indicated that the final decision
regarding BlackBerry's possible exit from the hardware arena will
be made later this year. At the company's annual shareholder
meeting, Chen stated,""The device business must be profitable, because we
don't want to run a business that drags onto the bottom line.""This statement mirrors his comment to Reuters two years ago when
he said,""If I cannot make money on handsets, I will not be
in the handset business.""0.8% Just Won't Cut It for BBRYConsidering the abysmal shrinkage of BlackBerry's handset sales,
it's unlikely that the company will be able to reverse such losses,
even if Chen can successfully push out a cheaper Android device
(sans keyboard).This doesn't mean the end of BBRY, but it does mean the end of
BBRY's most prominent consumer-facing division.According to comScore's most recent 2016 U.S.Smartphone Subscriber Market Share report, BlackBerry represents only 0.8% of the entire market, compared
with 52.7% forAlphabet Inc's (GOOGL,GOOG) Android OS and 43.9% forApple Inc.'s (AAPL) iOS.BlackBerry market share has never come close to rivaling Android
or iOS, and has shrunk from 1.8% to the current 0.8% over thepast 12 months.While one percentage point isn't usually a big deal, for a
struggling device maker on the brink of extinction and competing
with the likes of Google, Apple,Samsung Electronics(SSNLF) and evenMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT), the loss of that one point could quite literally be the death of
the BBRY handset, especially consideringthe rate at which BlackBerry's handset sales have
declined.What This Means for BlackBerry StockLast year, I touched on this very subject and opined thatit's time for BlackBerry to stop selling phones. As expected, considering the immense loyalty of the traditional
BlackBerry device owner, that editorial was met with a rash of
criticism, anger and outright hostility from diehard fans.However, since the publication of my earlier article, BlackBerry
stock has declined over 40%, revenue is down 40%, and net income
has tanked by 1,085%.Simply put, something has to give. Otherwise, BBRY stock will
continue to tumble.Fortunately for BlackBerry stock, the company has value beyond
just handsets. In fact, BBRY software sales have grown 131% year
over year. Eliminating the hardware division entirely would allow
Chen to focus the entirety of his company's resources on software
and security, the only things that have kept BlackBerry from
disappearing completely.AAPL Stock: Can India Be the Next China for
    Apple Inc.?The writing has been on the wall for a long time, and even
though there are still a few loyalists remaining who will, quite
literally,go to any length to continue using their BlackBerry
handsets, the numbers speak for themselves and it's clear that,""Barring some sort of huge miracle, BlackBerry will
never sell hardware in quantities that will be statistically
significant.""Expect BlackBerry stock to continue its downward spiral for the
next several months until CEO John Chen finally confirms the
decision to stop making phones. When that announcement is made,
though, BBRY stock could actually see a bump upward as analysts and
investors examine the prospects of that software-only
existence.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks That Can Withstand the Brexit7 Stocks to Buy Now for the Millennial

Synaptics Incorporated Stock: A Value Investor's Dream?;6/25/2016;"Despite closing up 4.5% by the end of trading on June 23,Synaptics(NASDAQ: SYNA) shareholders are still feeling the ill effects of
  its most recent bout of bad news: paring its global workforce by
  an estimated 160 people, reducing its total headcount by 9%.
  Synaptics is also implementing a ""space consolidation program,""
  which is simply a nice way of saying it's closing offices.
  Combined, the moves are expected to result in charges of between
  $13 million and $15 million in the coming quarters.Synaptics stock had already been under pressure given the
  much-publicized slowing of the PC and smartphone markets, both
  key areas of past growth, so the cost-cutting efforts fueled the
  bearish fire, which explains why its shares are down 29% year to
  date. But before shareholders and investors throw in the towel,
  Synaptics' recent woes - combined with some much-needed good news
  -- have also created a fantastic value opportunity.makeArticleAd();Image source:Synaptics.Where to from here?Synaptics hasn't been sitting idly by, lamenting the saturated
  smartphone and dying PC industries. It was November of last
  year when Synaptics let the world know its intentions in the
  fast-growing smart car market. At the time, Synaptics had already
  made inroads with auto manufacturers with a number of key wins
  thanks to its industry-leading display driver circuits.Infotainment systems are quickly becoming the norm in new
  cars, and Synaptics counts some of the world's largest automakers
  here and abroad as customers. But the good news doesn't stop with
  display drivers, as evidenced by the recent announcement of the
  ""broad availability"" of its much-anticipated ID touch sensors
  specifically designed for smart cars.In addition to the obvious touch sensor encryption and
  biometric applications, including unlocking a vehicle or starting
  it with nothing more than a touch, Synaptics said its new
  ""fingerprint sensor evaluation kit (EVK)"" also recognizes ""user
  input gestures including swipes, taps and long presses,"" making
  it ideal for infotainment systems as well.Cars are quickly becoming the ultimate mobile device, and the
  potential for new features such as Synaptics' solution are nearly
  limitless. That, of course, means some heady competition from
  touch-sensor early adopters, includingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Oh, the possibilitiesAs far back as the iPhone 5s release in the fall of 2013 and
  the Samsung Galaxy 5s introduced in early 2014, fingerprint
  sensors were prominently featured. It's not difficult to imagine
  either of the industry's big boys -- both of whom are actively
  targeting the smart car market, too -- translating similar
  fingerprint ID touch technologies as part of their respective car
  solutions.But don't count Synaptics out. Thanks in part to its existing
  relationships with global auto manufacturers, Synaptics has a
  built-in base of customers to target for its new EVK solution.
  And at $402.5 million in sales last quarter -- Synaptics' fiscal
  2016 Q3 -- it will take a lot less to move the revenue needle in
  the right direction than for either Apple's or Samsung's smart
  car efforts.Not to mention, based on virtually every estimate, the
  automotive infotainment market is poised to explode. One forecast
  suggests infotainment systems will generate $33.8 billion in
  revenue by 2022 -- and that could prove overly conservative
  considering the results of a recent survey.A group of new car buyers were asked which was more important
  to them, their new car's infotainment system, or driving
  performance. In today's mobile-centric world, the infotainment
  system has already become more important to a majority of new car
  buyers than performance. Of course, Synaptics' newly introduced
  fingerprint sensor kit has a host of potential applications
  beyond infotainment, but its rapid adoption could springboard the
  use of ID sensors throughout a car.The EVK solution was likely one of the new opportunities CEO
  Rick Bergman was considering when he alluded to Synaptics'
  ""short-term pause in our top-line growth"" last quarter. No, smart
  car fingerprint sensors won't miraculously turn Synaptics'
  revenue misfortunes around overnight: transforming a business to
  tackle new opportunities takes a while.However, at its currently depressed stock price and long-term
  growth prospects in a skyrocketing, multibillion-dollar market at
  the ready, Synaptics warrants a good, long look for investors in

An Apple iPhone Super Cycle In 2017?;6/25/2016;"So far,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) big year in 2016 has yet to materialize.AAPLdata byYChartsmakeArticleAd();Worse yet, increasingly widespread rumors suggest it might not
  come at all. Though still not a given, it seems more and more
  likely that the upcoming iPhone 7 will prove only an incremental
  improvement over the iPhone 6s, breaking Apple's long-standing
  tradition of even-year form factor overhauls.This is likely a negative in the near-term forApple stock, as it removesthe key catalystso many, myself included, had baked into their 2016 Apple
  investing thesis. However, as one analyst notes, this near-term
  negative comes with a long-term positive.The next, next iPhoneIn a recent note to clients,Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbinder Garcha made the case that 2017 will in fact be
  the year Apple returns to meaningful growth. In his analysis,
  Garcha sees a tepid consumer response for the iPhone 7 on the
  assumption that its form factor will remain largely in line with
  the current iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.Instead, Garcha argues that Apple will use 2017, the 10-year
  anniversary of the original iPhone, to launch a dramatically
  revamped handset. According to his analysis, the fall 2017 iPhone
  will feature, among other things, an all-glass casing that could
  possibly be curved. The iPhone 2017 iPhone may also include
  ""features and upgrades, including an OLED [organic light-emitting
  diode] screen, full glass display, no home button, enhanced
  Taptic Engine, improved camera, and wireless charging."" Garcha
  also sees Apple calling the device the iPhone 8, rather than the
  7s.With the iPhone responsible for the majority of Apple sales,
  this dramatically increases the odds that Apple stock will remain
  relatively range bound for the rest of the year. No new products
  of note likely mean a less-than-memorable year for the Mac maker.
  However, this also likely sets the stage for 2017 to be a
  blockbuster one for patient Apple investors.The ultimate iPhone ""super cycle""If this turns out to be the case, it means next year will
  likely see appreciable gains to Apple stock. This makes sense at
  both strategic and financial levels.I'm not the only one who's commented on how rival high-end
  smartphones, likeSamsung's Galaxy S7, today trumpApple's current iPhones. However, given Apple's long-standing historic track record of
  user retention, the risk of mass customer defections remains
  relatively muted, even if the iPhone 7 disappoints.Image Source: AppleIn this scenario, Apple will be simply shifting the embedded
  demand for its iPhones from one year to the next. In fact,
  waiting one additional year to launch an impressive iPhone
  upgrade should actually add to the latent demand for the
  forthcoming device. Seen this way, Garcha's purported iPhone 8
  would reach market to historically high levels of demand and all
  the financial rewards that would come with it. Especially when
  combined with Apple's ongoinginternational expansionefforts, next year's iPhone would then likely see a return to
  growth for Apple stock the likes of which we haven't seen since
  the launch of the iPhone 6.Adding some specificity to this idea, Garcha's analysis calls
  for reduced Apple EPS in its fiscal 2016 and 2017; remember the
  iPhone typically debuts in September, toward the end of Apple's
  fiscal year. However, in 2018, Garcha sees Apple generating
  $12.32 per share in earnings, an increase of roughly 50% over
  this year's average analyst estimate.Having to wait another year to see a major potential move in
  Apple stock is probably understandably frustrating for investors.
  However, if you believe this analysis, the risk-reward dynamic
  today remains tilted heavily in Apple's favor, especially when
  considering additional possible catalysts like increased capital
  return and possible new products. This might not be the year
  Apple investors have hoped for, but the upside potential in its
  shares remains as compelling as ever.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

What Is a Tiered Royalty?;6/24/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Tiered royalty rates are designed to generate maximum revenue
  (and, eventually, profit) from a license agreement. In a standard
  patent, copyright, or trademark license, the inventor charges its
  partner either a flat fee or a simple percentage of total sales.
  Tiered royalties go one step further by adjusting those simple
  royalty rates in various ways. The result: Both the inventor and
  the manufacturing/distribution partner can maximize their sales,
  and thus serve their shareholders better.makeArticleAd();Let me illustrate the concept through a couple of example
  scenarios.Promoting lots of volumeIn its simplest form, a tiered royalty deal acts like a volume
  discount. The first 100,000 units sold while using the
  intellectual property asset in question might send 5% of the
  distributor's net sales to the original inventor or designer.
  Units 100,001 to 1 million could fetch an 8% royalty rate, and
  anything beyond that would be tagged for a 5% royalty fee.That's an incentive to drive higher sales volumes. With this
  type of royalty structure in place, manufacturers and
  distributors have a solid reason to put their backs into
  marketing blitzes. Meanwhile, the original inventor of the patent
  -- or designer of the trademarks and copyrighted information --
  is assured of decent payouts when sales volumes turn out to be
  small.In a slightly more complicated real-world scenario, display
  technology researcherUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED)signed a six-year OLED technology dealwith electronics giantSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) in 2011. Here, the companies replaced a simple
  royalty percentage agreement with a two-part structure:Samsung pays Universal Display a flat fee in installments,
    once every other quarter. This sum started at $10 million in
    2011 and has escalated to a total of $60 million in 2016. This
    sliding scale was put in place in the original contract, and
    the increases are predictable.On top of that license arrangement, Universal Display also
    resells the required OLED chemicals and pockets a fee for that
    service. Samsung has agreed to certain purchase volumes and is
    always free to order more than expected. That revenue stream is
    nearly twice the size of the base license payment, with the
    caveat that Universal Display doesn't break out Samsung's
    materials contribution from other clients. Gross margins from
    this process currently stand at 71%, deducting the cost of
    ordering the actual materials from chemicals manufacturerPPG Industries.Like the ""volume discount"" example, this structure promotes
  high production volumes and gives Samsung every reason to step up
  manufacturing and sales of OLED products. Slowing down would make
  the basic license fee more costly on a per-unit basis, and it
  could trigger other penalties for not buying enough
  materials.The nitty-gritty details are not public knowledge, and the
  companies are likely to hammer out a new deal when this contract
  expires in 2017. The details we do have still make for an
  enlightening example of an alternative tiered royalty
  agreement.Image source: Getty Images.Global reachTiered royalties are very popular in the pharmaceutical
  industry. In this case, it's a matter of targeting each market
  according to what patients and insurance systems are able to
  pay.The World Health Organizationrecommendsa tiered royalty method when setting prices in the developing
  world. Crucial medications for life-threatening diseases like
  malaria or HIV/AIDS should start by determining their royalty
  rate in high-income markets. The rates from places like the U.S.
  and Germany are then adjusted for relative income per capita when
  setting prices in less prosperous countries. Furthermore, nations
  with particularly high disease burdens get an additional discount
  beyond what's normally a heavy per-capita income rebate.This structure lets drug developers and medical device
  inventors recoup their development costs with large royalties in
  richer markets. At the same time, the benefits of their
  inventions are extended to places that cannot afford the
  first-world payments. The arrangement benefits the drug
  developers too: Places like Somalia and Suriname can generate a
  modest level of low-margin sales. Under the standard royalty
  rate, sales would be indistinguishable from zero in these
  markets.These are just a couple of examples of tiered royalty rates
  and how they can boost business. Tiered structures allow the
  parties to tailor agreements to their specific market conditions.
  When this is done right, tiered royalties can boost overall sales
  while maximizing the resulting revenues and bottom-line
  profits.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Google's Radical Plan to Reinvent the Smartphone Could Devastate Apple and Samsung;6/23/2016;"A Project Ara smartphone. Image source: Google.comLater this year, Google will launch its very first smartphone.
  It could be the most revolutionary handset to hit the market
  sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) sold the original iPhone back in 2007.In the past,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) search giant has worked with its
  various hardware partners to deliver Google-branded Nexus phones,
  but it has never made a smartphone from start to finish. That
  will change later this year when its Project Ara smartphone goes
  on sale. Initially, it will be aimed at developers, but Google
  plans to sell it to consumers in 2017.makeArticleAd();Project Ara's success isn't guaranteed. Indeed, given its
  unorthodox nature, it could prove to be a dramatic failure. But
  if it succeeds, it could shake the very foundations of the
  handset market, and undermine the business models of both Apple
  andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .A different vision, but at least it's not vaporwareProject Ara was originally announced back in 2013, and then
  demonstrated publicly in 2014. It was supposed to begin shipping
  in the second half of last year, but in August, Google announced
  that it had been delayed. At the time,I warned that Project Ara seemed to be running
  the risk of becoming vaporware-- a promising device that, for whatever reason, fell short of
  internal expectations and never made it to the public.Fortunately, that's not the case. To be clear, the Project Ara
  phone shipping later this year is a less ambitious device than
  the one Google described previously. Originally, Project Ara
  would've been perhaps the last phone you'd ever need to buy --
  with a fully modular design, consumers would buy a phone frame
  from Google, then outfit it with a variety of modules. These
  modules would encompass key components, including the processor,
  memory, cellular radio, and display.Now, those key components are integrated into Project Ara's
  frame, along with a set of speakers. It's still a modular device,
  but the modules are limited to ancillary functions. The most
  useful may be the camera -- those willing and able to purchase
  the proper camera module could equip their Project Ara phone with
  a truly professional-grade camera. Other modules could add
  projectors, fitness sensors, game controllers, secondary
  displays, or larger batteries. Almost anything is possible. Each
  Project Ara phone can take up to six modules, allowing for a
  great degree of customization and added functionality.Redefining consumer expectationsGoogle's Android operating system has managed to captureabout 80% of the world's smartphone userslargely because of its customization options. Handset
  manufacturers are free to use the Android operating system on
  almost any smartphone, which has led to a flurry of different
  models. There's an Android phone sold at virtually every price
  point, in every size, on every carrier, in every country.Project Ara will bring customization to an entirely new level.
  There's still a lot reasons to doubt Project Ara's chances:
  Beyond Google's relative inexperience when it comes to selling
  handsets at scale, it's not clear that consumers will want to
  deal with the hassle of swapping modules. Introducing a wide
  variety of different hardware configurations could lead to bugs,
  or other unforeseen circumstances that make the user experience
  less than ideal. Many of the more attractive Project Ara modules
  could be expensive, and consumers may not be able to take
  advantage of generous financing plans currently offered by
  carriers to purchase them.But if Project Ara does succeed, it could change how consumers
  view the smartphone market. If must-have, revolutionary modules
  emerge, integrated phones that cannot work with Project Ara's
  modules could be at an immense disadvantage.Samsung and Apple remain theworld's largest smartphone sellers, and therefore remain the most susceptible to competition. Apple
  derived nearly two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone last
  quarter, and likely a larger percentage of its profit. Samsung is
  a more diversified business, but its mobile devices still brought
  in more than half its sales last quarter.Both companies have faced competition from a wide variety of
  sources in recent years, but they've never faced a competitor
  like Project Ara before. Investors in the space should watch
  Google's progress closely.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Apple Inc. Catches a Much-Needed Break in India;6/22/2016;"In what has been a challenging past 12 months forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, the Mac maker's difficulties in expanding
  deeper into India have made for an importantand frustratingstory line.AAPLdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();However, after a series of setbacks, it appears that the tide
  of Apple's India expansion ambitions may be about to turn for the
  better.Indian government changes FDI rulesEarlier this week, the Indian government announced
  plans to loosen key provisions of its long-standing policy
  regarding foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational
  companies.Image source: Apple.Specifically, the Indian government plans to loosen the
  requirement that foreign companies attempting to establish a
  company-owned presence in the world's second-most-populous nation
  source at least 30% of their raw materials from inside India. The
  Indian government will grant a three-year grace period before
  requiring single-brand retailers to comply with the 30%
  sourcing requirement. Additionally, companies deemed as selling
  ""state of the art or cutting edge technology"" may enjoy an
  additional five-year window before they must adhere to the
  stringent sourcing rules.Practically speaking, this announcement opens the door for
  Apple to apply to open its first wholly Apple-owned retail stores
  in the world's fastest-growing major smartphone market.
  Commenting on the matter in a Bloomberg report, retail
  consultant Devangshu Dutta said: ""The relaxed rules give Apple a
  window to build up a credible brand and give the company a chance
  to build up internal capability and familiarity with the supply
  base. ... For branding, a certain consistency is critical and
  this can be done by having retail control.""Until this point, Apple has been forced to partner with local
  retail firms and electronics chains to distribute its products, a
  dynamic that Apple reportedly feels has hampered the quality of
  the customer experience it so deeply values.An undeniable opportunityWith global smartphone shipments slowing, most worryingly in
  China, India remains the lone nation with enough growth potential
  to possibly move the needle for a corporate giant like Apple.
  Here's a quick snapshot comparing the entire Indian smartphone
  market to Apple during calendar year 2015.Units Shipped (in millions)Growth (YOY)Apple Inc.231.520.2%Total Indian Smartphone Market103.628.8%Data source: Apple investor relations and IDC.This sizable difference between a single company and the
  world's second-most-populous nation might come as a surprise to
  many casual readers. As a quick point of additional contrast,
  China recorded roughly 438 million smartphone shipments in 2015,
   according to Strategy Analytics. If anything, the chart
  above speaks to the immense latent growth potential the market
  offers handset makers like Apple,Samsung,Xiaomi, and others.With Apple's revenue expected to contract in its current
  fiscal year, especially if the iPhone 7 proves only an
  incremental improvement over the 6s, the company clearly needs to
  access any and all possible growth opportunities. And with China
  and much of the rest of the world's smartphone shipments slowing,
  India is perhaps the last obvious major growth market available
  for the company.At the same time, India isn't the most obvious fit for Apple's
  high-priced handsets. Roughly three-quarters of smartphones in
  India are sold for less than $150, and per-capita incomes in
  India are about one-tenth of those in the United States at
  constant prices.Apple launched the iPhone SE earlier this year in hopes that
  its new ""low cost"" handset might bridge the chasm to Apple's
  pricey handsets. Though certainly a price  improvement over
  its more expensive devices, the iPhone SE's roughly $580 sticker
  price, after taxes and tariffs, is likely unattainable for most
  Indian citizens.To be sure, an Apple move to open its own Apple retail stores
  in India should help bolster its presence in a market with truly
  impressive long-term potential. At the same time, though,
  breaking into India is unlikely to solve most of Apple's most
  pressing short-term issues.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

"Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Not Going to Pack ""Big Changes""";6/22/2016;"Image source: Apple.AreportfromThe Wall Street Journalclaims thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) intends to make ""only subtle changes"" to the
  iPhones that it will release this year, citing ""people familiar
  with the matter.""makeArticleAd();The new phones are going to come with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch
  displays, just as the prior two generations of iPhones did. As
  expected, the report claims that the ""biggest"" change in this
  year's iPhones will be ""the removal of the headphone plug,"" a
  change that's expected to ""make the phone thinner and improve its
  water resistance.""In line with previous rumors,The Wall Street Journalsays that Apple is eyeing its ""biggest design changes for 2017.""
  These changes, as have been claimed by others previously, could
  include ""an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED,
  screen and eliminating the home button by building the
  fingerprint sensor into the display.""Why the lack of huge changes?Interestingly,The Wall Street Journalhad some insight to share as to why Apple isn't planning the
  significant changes to this year's model that many had expected.
  Apparently, it's due simply to the fact that the ""new technology
  in the pipeline will take time to implement.""Although this makes sense, I can't help but wonder if Apple
  was caught flat-footed here. For example, several of Apple's
  competitors -- includingSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and Vivo -- today sell phones with curved OLED
  screens.Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S7 series of phones also come with
  glass casings, just as the upcoming 2017 iPhone is expected
  to.The technical challenges that Apple faces in bringing these
  features into mass-produced phones appear to have been solved by
  competitors.Does Apple need to boost research and development
    spending further?Although I don't doubtThe Wall Street Journal's reporting, I find it odd that Apple is somewhat behind the
  curve in terms of technology. The company's research and
  development spending over the years has skyrocketed, and the
  company has historically been very good about wringing as much as
  possible from all of those research and development dollars.On one hand, it would seem that a potential solution to Apple
  not falling behind again would be to simply boost research and

  well-served by making additional acquisitions to bolster its
  in-house technology development, particularly in the area of
  display technology (an area in which Apple appears to be falling
  significantly behind its competition).On the other hand, Apple may be investing at the correct rate,
  but management may simply be managing those investments
  poorly.Apple stockholders could be looking at a bum product cycleAs a result of Apple's fairly rigid yearly iPhone release
  cadence, the iPhones that come out later this year may simply not
  be enough to catalyze the upgrade activity necessary to put
  iPhone back on a growth path.It may very well be the case that Apple investors are going to
  have to weather another year of iPhone declines before the
  company's 2017 product release can get things back on track.Given the importance of iPhone to the company's top and bottom
  lines, Apple shares are looking increasingly less attractive

3 New Features the iPhone 7 MUST Have;6/10/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite efforts to diversify,Apple Inc.(AAPL) remains hugely dependant on the iPhone. New products like the
Apple Watch and a revamped Apple TV represent a drop in the bucket
compared to the sort of numbers a new iPhone typically brings
in.Source:via AppleBut coming off the first quarter since its 2007 launch in which
iPhone sales have declined, more than ever AAPL needs the iPhone 7
to be a hit.makeArticleAd();With the expected September release date creeping closer, here
are three features the iPhone 7musthave if it's going to convince people to upgrade and be the big
seller Apple needs.Features the iPhone 7 Must Have: A Better CameraThe iPhone helped to kick off the smartphone-as-a-camera
movement, and Apple has come to dominate traditional camera makers
when it comes to posting photos online. CheckYahoo! Inc.'s (YHOO)Flickr
photo sharing site, and various iPhone models top the popularity list.The 10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the
    BeachHowever, with the iPhone 6s, Apple's lead in smartphone camera
superiority slipped. It's not that the iPhone 6s didn't have a good
camera, but beyond bumping the resolution, AAPL didn't do much in
the way ofimprovementover the previous generation.Arch-rivalSamsung(SSNLF), on the other hand, completely redesigned the camera it put in
the Galaxy S7. It has a wider aperture and larger pixels than the
iPhone's (resulting in better low-light shooting) and in tests,
Samsung's new dual-pixel sensor allowed it tofocus on subjects three to four times fasterthan the iPhone's camera.The camera is one of the iPhone's signature features, so there
are bragging rights at stake. And more importantly, a dramatically
improved camera - not just a bump in resolution - is one of those
key features that could convince current owners to upgrade to a new
iPhone.Features the iPhone 7 Must Have: More StorageApple has offered 16GB as the base storage in its smartphones
since the iPhone 5 was released in 2012. Since that time, new
iPhones have come with higher resolution cameras, gained 4K video
capability, adopted higher resolution displays and the iOS - the
operating system that powers the devices - has grown in size. All
of these factors eat into storage space. Photos require more
storage, 4K video requiresdramaticallymore storage and apps are using up more space.Apple has stubbornly kept the base storage of the iPhone at
16GB, pointing to features like iCloud storage and Apple Music
streaming as options to reduce the amount of storage required
locally.In reality, the decision seemed more business-based. With Flash
memory an inexpensive commodity, AAPL was reportedly making an
extra $88 in profit every time a new iPhone buyer decided 16GB was
too little and spent the $100 extra to upgrade to the next level of
storage capacity.With the iPhone 7, Apple needs to accept reality and boost the
storage capacity of its base model to at least 32GB. The Galaxy S7
comes with 32GB standard,Alphabet Inc's (GOOG,GOOGL) Google Nexus 6P comes with 32GB and theLGG5 has 32GB. In fact, 16GB of storage is pretty much found only in
budget smartphones these days … and the Apple iPhone.Besides the fact that it looks terrible in comparison charts,
the iPhone 7 needs to move up from 16GB of storage or Apple is
going to face a backlash from consumers who are fed up with
juggling apps, music and videos due to chronic storage issues.Features the iPhone 7 Must Have: Water ResistanceOne tentpole feature that AAPL appears to have been working
toward is a waterproof - or at least water-resistant - iPhone.Water damage is one of the big causes for iPhone damage, and
it's also one of the leading causes of expensive iPhone repairs.
And when you think about it, this makes sense. It's not just the
risk of accidentally spilling a drink on your smartphone - when we
carry these things everywhere, all the time, and use them
constantly, they're going to get exposed to the elements.The issue of water damage is common enough that Apple puts
liquid contact indicators in its iPhones and won't honor the
warrantyif it decides there has been water damage.In contrast, the Galaxy S7 is rated asIP68water and dust resistant. It can be used in the rain, mud can
simply be wiped off and it will even survive a 30-minute dunk in
five feet of water. All of these scenarios could result in a costly
repair bill with an iPhone.Apple began quietly experimenting with design changes starting
with the iPhone 6 that have improved water resistance, but
releasing an iPhone 7 that was actually rated as water-resistant
would be a big enough feature that many holdouts would upgrade from
their older iPhones. And it's about time iPhone users could text,
take a call or snap a photo outdoors without worrying that rain
could brick their device.E3 Rumors: What to Expect at Video Gaming's Big
    EventOf course there are plenty of other features high on the wish
list of iPhone fans - a higher resolution, OLED display is one of
the big ones. But the reality is a massive overhaul in technology
like that doesn't seem to be in the cards for this generation. With
Applereportedly moving to a three-year refresh cyclefor all-new iPhone releases, it's more likely the iPhone 8 in 2017
will be on the receiving end of the dramatic redesign and major
technological leaps.But even though it looks as thoughthe form factor won't be changing any from the
iPhone 6and iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 needs compelling new capabilities like
the three features I've listed, or AAPL is going to have a long,
rough year.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAmazon Echo: The Smart Home LeaderApple Is Taking a HUGE Risk With the MacBook

3 Apple Inc. Suppliers That Could Benefit from the iPhone 7 Launch;6/10/2016;"Image credit: Apple.In September,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to unveil its next generation iPhone,
  presumably called the iPhone 7. The device is going to be a
  particularly important one for the company as it looks to recover
  from the slump in sales that it suffered from throughout the
  iPhone 6s cycle.makeArticleAd();Although it's far too early to tell how well the device will
  do in the market, particularly as the weak reception to the
  iPhone 6s series seemingly came as a surprise to everyone
  (including Apple itself), there are a number of Apple suppliers
  that should benefit from the launch. Here are three.1. IntelChip giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been harshly criticized for largely missing
  out on the smartphone revolution. The company has tried for years
  to build products suitable for smartphones, but aside from a few
  token design wins, it has been unsuccessful.However, there are several reports that Intel will win the
  modem/baseband spot inside some percentage of the next generation
  iPhones that ship. If the reports are true, then whether Apple
  sees iPhone unit growth or not over the coming product cycle,
  Intel should benefit by virtue of simply shipping modems to Apple
  during this iPhone cycle when it hadn't in many previous
  cycles.Looking longer-term, if Intel can execute to a series of
  competitive modem products, it may be able to continue to win
  spots in future iPhones. This isn't likely to be a huge
  revenue/profit driver for the company, but as long as Intel can
  generate incremental profit from such deals, I don't think
  shareholders will complain.2. BroadcomToday'sBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is a combination of a company that was formerly
  known as Broadcom (management refers to it as ""Classic Broadcom"")
  and Avago. Both Classic Broadcom and Avago were suppliers to
  Apple. Avago provided RF filters while Classic Broadcom provided
  a Wi-Fi chip as well as some other components.On Broadcom's recent earnings call, management indicated that
  it expects to see a significant increase in both RF content in
  the next iPhone (which would benefit ""Classic Avago"") as well as
  a boost in Wi-Fi content (which benefits ""Classic Broadcom"").This means that even if iPhone unit sales don't grow much (or
  at all), Broadcom could still register revenue growth related to
  the iPhone in the coming product cycle.3. TSMCFor the A8 chip that powered the iPhone 6/6 Plus, as well as
  the A8X chip that powered the iPad Air 2, Apple moved away from
  longtime chip manufacturing partnerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and toward Taiwan-based contract chip
  manufacturerTSMC(NYSE: TSM) .For the A9 chip that powered the iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus,
  Apple split the orders between TSMC and Samsung (and it is
  generally believed that TSMC got the minority allocation of the
  orders).However, for the upcoming A10 chip, it is widely believed that
  Apple will move back to TSMC exclusively. Furthermore, it is
  expected that the A10 will use TSMC's new chip packaging
  technology known as InFO, which should give TSMC greater content
  share.In this case, just as with Intel and Broadcom, TSMC should
  benefit from this coming iPhone cycle whether or not iPhone
  shipments ultimately grow or not.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,
    but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:
    There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) Gets Boost as Rate Hike Fears Diminish;6/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's amazing how one set of nonfarm payroll data can change
plans for the Federal Reserve, but that's exactly what happened. Up
until Friday of last week, the CBOEFed Watch toolwas indicating more than a 50% chance of a rate hike in July.Source:FlickrJust a few hours later everything changed. After a dismal job
report with Nonfarm payrolls growing by 38,000 in May, against an
expected 164,000, the probability of a Fed rate hike was pushed far
back. And that is great news for emerging markets stocks and more
specifically, theiShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF(EEM).makeArticleAd();The idea of a rate hike coming perhaps this July wasn't sitting
well with Emerging Market stocks. Brazil is in a severe recession,
China is in a fragile recovery and commodities - a key growth
engine for emerging markets - are extremely vulnerable. A Fed rate
hike at this stage could have exacerbated all of the problems that
are already weighing on emerging markets.7 Best Stocks to Buy on the Next DipBut now, as a rate hike has been kicked further down the road
(possibly all the way to December), emerging markets just got a
strong tailwind. The EEM ETF, after lagging in performance to
benchmarks such as theS&P 500in the U.S. and the STOXX 600 in Europe, can finally catch up.EEM ETF Is Well PositionedPlaying catch up may sound easy, but it's really a rather
delicate game of balance - balance between allocating to the
battered sectors in emerging markets now that trade is cheap and
diversifying to mitigate some of the risk. The EEM ETF does a good
job in maintaining that delicate balance.In terms of sector allocation, 26% of the EEM ETF is allocated
to financials. Financials in emerging markets had been brutally hit
by the woes in China and fears over a Fed rate hike. The rather
significant allocation allows you to get the upside as the stage is
set for a rebound.Among the stocks EEM holds under the category areChina Construction Banktraded in Hong Kong andIndustrial & Commercial Bank of Chinatraded in Shanghai.The IT sector has the second biggest allocation, with 22.5% of
total assets, including big names such asBaidu Inc (ADR)(BIDU) andSamsung(SSNLF) stock traded in South Korea.Consumer discretionary, which is comprised primarily of
retailers and deemed risky, is only 11% of the total allocation.
Clearly, EEM has the upside on financials and IT, but beyond that,
no sector is overly allocated and the risk is mitigated with proper
diversification.When it comes to country risk, the EEM is diversified across the
globe into countries such as China, Brazil, India and Taiwan.The EEM ETF total mix of allocation gives it a weighted PE ratio
of 11X, and that is compared to roughly 17X of theSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY), which tracks the S&P 500. And that's not only cheap but also
means there's still plenty of room to go higher without turning
expensive.AMBA Stock: Why Ambarella Inc Is up 25% in 5
    DaysClick to EnlargeComparing the EEM ETF with the S&P 500 through theMorningstar Chart, it is clear both have diverged since around 2014, when troubles
for emerging markets began. The S&P 500 has a total return of
12% on a rolling basis and the EEM ETF total return is -5%, a 17%
gap.Sure, troubles are not over for emerging markets and they are
inherently riskier. But even if the EEM ETF can't close the gap
with the S&P 500 entirely, just meeting the gap halfway it is
roughly 8% to 9% upside - worth the risk, despite all the
trouble.As of this writing, Lior Alkalay did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Big Tech Stocks Leading the Second-Half

Samsung's Next-Gen Smartphones Could Be Revolutionary;6/8/2016;"Image source: Samsung.After years of double-digit growth, smartphones have finally
  met a fate similar to tablets, desktop computers, and laptop
  PCs: slowing shipments amid market saturation. Information
  technology research companyGartnernow expects smartphone shipments to slow to 7% growth this year,
  down from the 14.4% growth the industry experienced last
  year.makeArticleAd();Gartner's research director, Roberta Cozza, characterized the
  state of smartphone sales going forward: ""The smartphone market
  will no longer grow at the levels it has reached over the last
  seven years. Smartphone sales recorded their highest growth in
  2010, reaching 73%."" Additionally, Gartner's research suggests
  the majority of year-over-year smartphone growth will come from
  developing markets like India and China.This is a poor forecast for high-end smartphone vendors likeSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) that make the majority of their profits in
  developed markets. It's likely to take a novel concept to
  encourage consumers in developed markets to upgrade, and Samsung
  may be onto something with its newest concept.A bendable phone?According to Bloomberg, Samsung may be working on a next-genbendablesmartphone utilizing organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs, for
  a model that could come to market as soon as 2017. Bloomberg
  quotes sources describing a phone/tablet combo that could be used
  as a handset with a screen size of 5 inches, but expanded to an
  8-inch tablet by unfolding the bendable screen.Samsung has always led Apple in the OLED race: Samsung has
  been using OLEDs for multiple generations of high-end
  smartphones. Apple has slowly been working on replacing its
  liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, with OLEDs due to their lighter
  and thinner displays, better viewing experience, and faster
  response times, and increasingly it looks like Apple will
  incorporate the technologyinto 2017's iPhone generation.A smartphone and a tablet without the drawbacks of a
  phabletMake no mistake, however: The key here is the bendable
  display. The trend in smartphones has been a larger display,
  which narrows the difference between a traditional smartphone and
  a tablet. So-called phablet models, which average between 5 and 6
  inches, have exploded in popularity at the expense of
  cannibalizing the tablet.For all their popularity, however, phablets do present
  trade-offs. The larger form factor impacts portability, an
  important factor for smartphone screen sizes, and while larger
  than traditional smartphones, phablets are still limited in
  display size versus conventional tablets. Samsung's potential
  product appears to solve both issues by offering a tablet-sized
  display with the portability of a traditional smartphone.There would be risks for Samsung with such a product: The user
  experience cannot suffer as a result of the bendable screen. If
  it does, it's likely this product would be relegated to niche
  status. In computers, the newest trend is the 2-in-1
  laptop/tablet hybrid, as users are increasingly looking to one
  unit to meet the majority of their computing needs. Samsung is
  attempting to bring this concept to the smartphone, and could
  have a hit on its hands by doing so.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Icahn vs. Buffett: Who “Gets” Apple Inc. Stock? (AAPL);6/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a good 'ole fashioned showdown on Wall Street as two
investment giants tackleApple Inc. (AAPL).Source:via AppleOn one side of the trade, we have notorious activist investor
Carl Icahn. Due to apprehension about Chinese consumer strength,
Icahn headed for thequickest exithe could find, pocketing a cool $2 billion profit.makeArticleAd();But hoisting the bullish argument is Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B,BRK.A), which recently disclosed a$1.1 billionposition inApple stock. With the line drawn in the sand, who will win out in the AAPL
chess match?Both sides certainly have compelling evidence.Icahn vs. BuffettThe benchmark exchange-traded fundTechnology Select Sector SPDR(XLK) - where Apple stock is its top holding - has been a hit-or-miss
affair. That's why Buffett himself elected his trusted stock picker
to make thego-ahead decision.7 Best Stocks to Buy on the Next DipIn addition, iPhone production woes point toweak demandfor the AAPL pipeline's flagship product.But then again, we are talking about Apple - the world'smost valuablebrand. It hasenough moneyto be a viable, emerging-marketnation. It didn't get there solely on the back of good fortune. And Apple
stock has seen far worse in terms of technical performance, yet it
has always found a way to higher ground. Icahn, despite his exit,
admitted as much, stating that AAPL is a well-run organization.Click to EnlargeWhat really has the bears salivating, of course, is the sharp
year-over-year loss in iPhone sales. It was the company's
first-ever loss for its smartphone division, and the results
cratered Apple stock. Icahn views that as an insurmountable
headwind, particularly with a weak China broadly pressuring
AAPL.Since the iPhone's introduction, there is a 91% statistical
correlation between its sales growth and thequarterlyperformance of Apple stock. That's not surprising when the iPhone
accounts for more thantwo-thirdsof total revenue, furthering validating Icahn's selloff.At the same time, Wall Street analysts aren't as eager as Icahn
to abandon ship. In fact, several investment firms side with
Buffett, maintaining apositive outlookon Apple stock.For one thing, the potential lack of new features in the
upcoming iPhone 7 may not be a sales deterrent as many consumers
are at least one generation behind in the product lifecycle. To
them, the ""7"" represents a big step up.The other factor to consider is that top-line sales alone won't
wholly determine the future of Apple stock. There's something to be
said about keeping the competition at bay.While AAPL is getting bruised bySamsung Electronic(SSNLF) in terms of smartphone market share, the former owns its entire
product ecosystem. Samsung, in contrast, lags ininterconnectivityamong its devices. Furthermore, sales of both new and used iPhones
will only increase opportunities for service- and
accessory-oriented revenue.Click to EnlargeIndeed, those following in the footsteps of Buffett would be
encouraged to know that Apple'sannualstock returns are not as dependent upon iPhone sales as they may
initially appear. Mathematically, there's no strong
correlation between the two.For example, from 2009 through 2012, unit sales growth of
iPhones averaged 81%, whereas Apple stock returns - measured from
Q1 to Q4 - averaged only 45%. From 2013 until last year, iPhone
growth averaged 23%, but Apple stock returns did slightly better at
24%.While nearer-term momentum for AAPL is impacted by the company's
smartphone business, in the long run, Apple stock is more
independent from iPhone sales. That's great news for Buffett and
his Berkshire portfolio, which aims for profit sustainability.It also dispels the myth that Apple stock can't survive without
its flagship model constantly breaking new ground.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: CMG Stock Is
    About to Wolf Down More PainBottom Line for AAPL StockIn the end, neither Buffett nor Icahn will likely regret their
decision towards Apple stock. Icahn played strictly by the
investor's playbook by making money - and lots of it. He was right
to dump his position when he did, knowing that AAPL faces immediate
challenges.Buffett, though, is the one that truly ""gets"" Apple stock. Even
though he personally doesn't like tech's inherent volatility, he
trusted his advisors to make a long-term bet on a company backed by
solid fundamentals.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in

12 Virtual Reality Stats That Will Blow You Away;6/6/2016;"Virtual reality has been touted as the ""next big thing"" over
  the past few decades, but the technology never seemed good enough
  to create seamless virtual worlds. But recent advancements in
  graphics, motion sensors, and mobility have finally paved the way
  for a new wave of VR headsets -- tethered to PCs, smartphones,
  and gaming consoles -- to reach a wider range of mainstream
  consumers. Let's check out twelve impressive stats about the
  virtual reality market that tech investors should know.1.The virtual reality market could be worth $30 billion by
  2020, claims tech M&A advisory firm  Digi-Capital. Most of
  that growth is expected to come from sales of VR headsets, games,
  and videos.makeArticleAd();2.500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025, according toPiper Jaffray. That could be good news for first movers likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)  with their respective Oculus Rift and
  Gear VR offerings. Component makers likeAMDalso stand to benefit.3.171 million people could be using VR hardware and
  software worldwide by 2018, according to research firm  KZero. The firm categorizes
  the majority of those users as ""early majority (mainstream)""
  users including kids, tweens, and teens, indicating that VR
  headsets could replace or complement gaming consoles.4.You'll have to wait up to four months for an Oculus Rift
  headset, due to a supply shortage and ordering processing issues. But
  that hasn't stopped Facebook from showcasing the headset atbrick-and-mortar stores.5.Google's Cardboard app has been downloaded up to 10
  million times.Although the Rift's orders have been delayed, many mainstream
  consumers are downloadingAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) app to experience VR on
  inexpensive cardboard headsets for their smartphones. That
  enthusiasm convinced many Oculus developers to port their apps to
  Android devices.Image source: Google6.Onemillion people have used Samsung's Gear VR over the
  past month, according to  an Oculus statement in mid-May. That's a
  significant milestone indicating that mobile-based VR solutions,
  which don't require high-priced PCs, might be more widely
  accepted by mainstream consumers.7.Nearly 1.3 million people subscribe to the YouTube 360
  channel.Google's push into panoramic 360-degree videos is also paying off
  and getting mainstream viewers interested in the idea of viewing
  VR content. That interest is fueling the rise of pricey360-degree camera rigs.8.Over one million hours of video have been watched on Gear
  VR, according to  Facebook's statement in February. That's
  another major milestone for Facebook's Oculus Home ecosystem,
  which powers both the Gear VR and the Oculus Rift.9.250 apps are available for that ecosystem, Facebook claimed in  May. That's not much compared to the
  two million apps on Google Play, but it's definitely enough to
  keep new headset owners busy. Like Google, Facebook keeps a 30%
  cut of paid VR app sales.Oculus apps. Image source: Oculus10.200,000 developers have already registered to build games
  for the Oculus Rift. This means that VR apps could  become a major source of
  revenue for Facebook and help itrecoup the $2 billionit initially spent acquiring Oculus.11.28 million people could be paying for VR hardware and
  content by 2018, according to  KZero. That's up from the just 4.8 million
  estimated early adopters this year.12.There are currently 685 virtual reality start-ups with
  anaverage valuation of $4.5 million, according to start-up tracking site AngelList. The three most
  followed VR start-ups on that list are VR tool creator
  MediaSpike, VR social network TeliportMe, and VR publishing
  platform Sketchfab.But don't blindly follow the VR herd . . .All these numbers seem to indicate that virtual reality could
  indeed become the next big thing, but investors should also
  understand the significantchallengesfacing mainstream adoption. A recent Valve survey found less than
  20% of gamers wanted to upgrade their systems to play VR
  games, while a Horizon Media survey found that 55%
  of respondents didn't want a VR device, because it wasn't
  ""interesting or exciting"". So investors should know that while
  the VR market is off to a solid start, its rise from niche
  technology to next-gen mainstream computing platform is not yet
  certain.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

have been duking it out over who is going to control the smart
home. It's not necessarily about selling ""smart"" devices (although
Google did snap up Nest Labs for this purpose), but who ends up as
the central point of control of all of this smart home tech.makeArticleAd();Amazon Echo Is AMZN's Way Into the Smart HomeApple has been pushing HomeKit, Google has Weave andSamsung(SSNLF) has SmartThings. The idea is to encourage companies that actually
make the connected devices like thermostats, locks, lights, cameras
and appliances to adhere toyourstandard. Thenyoursmartphone platform becomes the uber remote control that is the
focal point of the smart home.If consumers know that they can pick up your smartphone and
speak to your virtual assistant to control any connected device in
their home, that's a significant competitive advantage. You'll sell
more smartphones … and as an added bonus, all of that valuable data
flows through your hub.However, AMZN - whose attempt at breaking into the smartphone
marketwas a resounding failure- found a back door to the smart home: theAmazon Echo.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the BeachIn the guise of a Bluetooth speaker, Amazon introduced its Alexa
virtual assistant into the home. At first, Alexa was primarily
focused on playing the music you want and ordering products from
Amazon. But AMZN quickly started signing up partners in the smart
home space.The always-on Echo, with Alexa able to pick up voice commands
from a distance (thanks to an array of omni-directional
microphones) clicked with consumers and with smart home product
manufacturers. With this function, there is no having to look for
your smartphone to issue a command, with a relatively inexpensive
Amazon Echo always ready to take your commands.The Echo is now a very big deal. It has a huge range of
smart home partners - including Alphabet's Nest - and AMZN says it
now hasover 1,000 employees focused on the Amazon Echoand Alexa.Where's Apple?If you needed any more proof that, the Amazon Echo was
succeeding in its plan to do an end-run around smartphones
that arrived a few weeks ago with the arrival ofGoogle Home.The big question now is: Where is Apple's response? Consumers
and smart home product manufacturers are piling on the Amazon Echo
bandwagon.The last thing AAPL wants to do is to cede the smart home to
Amazon or Google, but having to pick up an iPhone to speak to Siri
is proving to be an awkward, inconvenient and expensive method of
controlling smart devices - at least compared to the unobtrusive,
always-on, speaker-in-disguise Amazon Echo.Wiredjust published a post with a headline that sums up how quickly this
situation is turning dangerous for Apple: ""The iPhone's Biggest Threat Isn't Android-It's
Amazon's Echo.""Apple may not have the artificial intelligence chops that
Google has, but Siri is a capable virtual assistant. The company
also owns Beats Electronics, which makes a very popular Bluetooth
speaker.Google Home: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG,GOOGL) is
    Coming After Amazon's EchoIt has sold its own line of routers - the Airport Express,
Airport Extreme and Time Capsule - for over 15 years. Of course,
there's also the Apple TV, a connected box (now with Siri support)
that's in millions of homes andonce again on an upswing in popularity.In other words, Apple has all the pieces. It has also had a year
to study the Amazon Echo in action and learn from AMZN's mistakes.
The two questions are: When is it going to pull the trigger and
what form will AAPL's answer to the Echo take?Rumors have begun to circulate that Apple may be preparing to go
much further than the Amazon Echo. Perhaps an Apple TV equipped
with cameras and facial recognition that can identify someone who
walks into a room and automatically adjust smart gear to match
their preferences.Gizmodocalled this prospect ""Goddamned terrifying.""It's possible we will get a hint of what AAPL is up to in
its bid to take on the Amazon Echo in a few weeks, at WWDC 2016.
Whether that happens, it's a safe bet that Apple engineers are
working on it.The Amazon Echo has proved Siri on an iPhone is not going to win
the battle to control the smart home, and Apple is not about to
walk away and leave the prize for AMZN and Google to fight over,
especially in these days of declining iPhone profits when new
sources of revenue are more important than ever.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Tech Stocks … Of 2020!Apple Inc. (AAPL): What Should You Expect at

  strongest first quarter on record. In other markets, Android's
  strength was noticeable, edging back after last year's decline.
  The release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the first
  larger-screen phones from the Cupertino tech giant, propelled
  iOS's share of the smartphone market in China, the U.K., Germany,
  and Italy in the first quarter of 2015. That strength receded
  somewhat this year.Some of Android's gain was driven by the decline of
  alternative operating systems. For the last five years, Android
  and iOS have held the smartphone market in a virtual duopoly,
  even though Windows Phone andBlackBerryhave captured some sales. Increasingly, though, that's no
  longer the case. In the first quarter of 2015, Windows Phone
  captured 14.4% of the Italian smartphone market, for example. But
  in the first quarter of this year, that number fell to just
  6.3%.Android strength wasn't driven by any particular vendor.Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 went on sale in the first quarter and
  managed to exceed the Korean tech giant's expectations. Kantar
  noted that it played a role in driving Android's strength among
  American buyers, but it didn't have much of an effect in other
  markets. Europeans and Chinese consumers opted for devices from
  Huawei, ASUS, Wiko, and Oppo in increasingly greater numbers.The iPhone remains Apple's most important
    segmentThe iPhone generated nearly 65% of Apple's revenue last
  quarter, and likely a larger percentage of its net income. Any
  changes in the relative popularity of the iPhone have a
  significant effect on Apple's financials.Apple shares have performed poorly this year, falling more
  than 4% as the iPhone business has stalled. iPhone unit sales
  contracted 16% on an annual basis last quarter, and revenue fell
  18%. That was much worse than the larger smartphone market, which
  saw a modest 0.2% gain in shipments, according to IDC. In
  the quarter before that, Apple saw no iPhone unit growth at all,
  and its revenue inched up a paltry 1%.In this slower-growth environment, Android vendors appear to
  be outperforming Apple, which hopes to drive interest with this
  year's iPhone.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Samsung;6/1/2016;"Doughnuts or bananas? Both can be pretty sweet, actually.Samsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is the Korean poster boy for consumer
  electronics, deeply involved in every corner of that market.Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) battles Samsung head-to-head in the memory chip
  sector -- and that's all.makeArticleAd();So we're looking at two very different companies here, even
  though they are direct rivals in one important market. Which
  stock is the better fit for your own investment portfolio?Before we get startedLet's just clear up one important detail right here. No,
  Samsung shares are not trading on any of the major American stock
  markets. The stock is issued on the Korean stock exchange, Korea
  Exchange, with proper global depositary receipts available on the
  London and Luxembourg exchanges. The ""global"" bit of that moniker
  is somewhat misleading, since U.S. residents are explicitly
  forbidden from trading these papers.But you can still own Samsung shares. Two American banks have
  the right to buy and sell Samsung shares directly on the Korean
  market, on behalf of their customers. Or you can drop down to the
  over-the-counter or Pink Sheets markets to grab a variety of
  not-quite-authoritative Samsung shares. These alternative shares
  tend to follow the official stock in the long run, but it's not a
  perfect fit and you may miss out on some important shareholder
  rights. Find out more onSamsung's investor relationspages.Oh, and Micron's headquarters can be found in Boise, Idaho.
  That's about 670 miles away from Silicon Valley. It's a
  two-letter ticker, trading on the traditionally four-letter
  Nasdaq Stock Market. I think that covers Micron's deepest
  mysteries.By the numbersBoth companies are running into a changing environment for
  consumer technologies.Samsung's annual sales fell 2.6% in 2015, and net profits
  declined by 18.5%. For Micron, revenue slid 1% lower, and diluted
  earnings fell 2.8%.Both companies pointed to weak demand from a handful of
  end-user markets. In particular, mobile-device growth is taking a
  global breather. On the other hand, enterprises are getting into
  solid-state drives in a big way, which helps the memory makers
  prop up their revenue flows until the consumers come around
  again.That just about explains Micron's current situation. However,
  memory chips account for just 17% of Samsung's annual sales.
  Mobile devices serve as the company's largest division, showing
  single-digit sales declines in 2015. Here, management is looking
  for a single-digit rebound in 2016.The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge handset, an important piece of
    the Korean company's current business. Image source:Samsung.Digging deeperSo neither Micron nor Samsung are showing any signs of massive
  growth prospects these days. Micron's play on economies of scale
  has largely played out already, so the company must now simply
  out-execute the competition. Samsung's mobile growth is stalling,along with the restof that former hypergrowth market.Samsung is the far larger business here, and its operations
  are more diverse. Unfortunately, the largest end market in
  Samsung's sights does not seem due for any massive growth spurts
  any time soon. The upcoming fifth-generation wireless rollouts
  may prove me wrong, but even that expected growth driver is still
  several years away.For Micron, the path back to steady growth runs through the PC
  and server markets. Mobile growth would be nice for Micron too,
  but the company isn't betting on it as heavily as Samsung is.
  This is not necessarily an easier road, but solid-state drives
  should lead the way for at least a couple more years. The
  traditional hard-drive builders are shaking in their boots over
  this revolution and doing their best to adapt to this new
  reality. Micron and Samsung sit on the other end of that
  equation.So which stock should I own?Personally, I already own Micron shares. That position was
  built in 2013, as the game-changing Elpida buyout inched toward
  completion. But the original investment thesis has run its
  course. In retrospect, I could have sold at the end of 2014 for a
  nifty sixfold gain. Share prices have retreated by a hair-raising
  64% from those highs.That makes Micron a deeply discounted value stock in my view.
  I'm not saying that the stock incontrovertibly belongs north of
  $35 per share, or that the PC market is due for another
  kick-start. But the stock is trading right at Micron's current
  book value, which means that market makers think that investors
  would pretty much break even if the company just sold off its
  assets and got out of doing business.Thatis an unreasonable conclusion, and a signpost on the road to
  renewed share price growth. Even if the business just holds
  steady at its current cash flows and returns on equity, its
  valuation multiples should rise higher.Samsung is in a very similar boat, with price-to-book values
  just above 1.0. It's also a far more profitable business, with
  much deeper pockets in case the market drought sticks around for
  several years. Everything I said about Micron also applies to
  Samsung, and perhaps to an even greater degree.I think we have two winners here. I'll simply stick with my
  existing Micron position for now, but new money could just as
  easily get into Samsung at these bargain-bin prices.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,

Why Is Micron Technologies (MU) Stock Up Again Today?;5/31/2016;"Shares of Micron TechnologiesMUare gaining for the ninth straight day of trading. As the company
launches two new solid state drive (SSD) products, it appears that
investors and analysts are finally starting to become bullish on
the struggling company.The stock was up $0.31, or 2.56%, to $12.62 as of 2:50 p.m. EDT
on Tuesday. MU has not seen the $13 level since January 12, when it
peaked at $13.24. Since then, it has hit its 52-week low of $9.31
and is currently down about 15% on the year.Some of Micron's recent price action has been thanks to analyst
upgrades. The latest came today from Tristan Gerra of Baird. After
holding a ""Neutral"" rating on the stock for nearly nine months,
Gerra boosted Micron to ""Outperform"" and raised his price target
from $12 to $18.Gerra cited new demands from leading manufacturers like SamsungSSNLF, saying that they ""may shift meaningful capacity from DRAM to NAND
this second half.""Gerra's note comes on the same day that Micron is launching two
brand new 3D NAND SSD products. These new SSDs, the Micron 1100 and
2100, promise to be faster, more reliable, more efficient, and more
secure.While it is refreshing to see Micron performing better after
such a long rough patch, the company will still need to prove that
it can deliver on earnings this year. Over the past 60 days, we
have seen seven negative estimate revisions for the company's
quarterly earnings and eight negative revisions for its annual
earnings. Investor confidence is improving, but Micron still needs
to deliver.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple Inc.: Why AAPL Shouldn’t Budge on iPhone Prices;5/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung's (SSNLF) smartphone lead onApple Inc.(AAPL) widened during the first quarter; it was the effect of an
aggressive pricing strategy for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge
smartphones. Given Apple's recent troubles in the smartphone arena,
many analysts and investors are looking to Samsung's success
and demanding that AAPl follow a similar strategy in order to
boostApple stock.Source:iphonedigital via FlickrFurthermore, with Apple's success in the services business, it
has provided activists with the needed ammunition to spark real
debate regarding this iPhone discount conversation.makeArticleAd();After all, Apple may not make as much money from the sale of
hardware, but it can get more people on its ecosystem to consume
services. Although all of this thinking is logical,
it would be a bad idea for the company and Apple stock.Apple Stock Doesn't Need Reduced iPhone PricesIn the first quarter of 2015, Samsung sold 21 million more
smartphones than Apple. But in the first quarter this year,
Samsung's lead jumped to nearly 30 million devices, sparked by
what Kantar's Lauren Guenveur called the ""most heavily promoted phones, ever"". That's saying a lot.While it may seem that Apple should follow suit, the biggest
reason Apple should not follow Samsung is because it does not need
too.The 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy NowYes, Apple's unit sales declined by more than 8 million
year-over-year. That seems alarming, but investors have to remember
that Apple is in an ""S"" year for iPhones, and this year is being
compared to Apple's best performing 12-month period for iPhones in
half a decade.For example, unit sales for smartphones in Apple's fiscal second
quarter last year jumped 40% to 61.2 million units and revenue
jumped 55% to $40.3 billion. Those were huge jumps, and a
reflection of Apple entering new markets and launching two
smartphones - the 6 and 6 Plus - at the same time, versus one (the
5s) in the year prior.Given how ""S"" years tend to underperform ""number"" years for
iPhone launches, 2015 was the perfect storm for AAPL to deliver
unprecedented results.With that said, if you look solely at Apple's fiscal second
quarter, and remove last year's ""perfect storm,"" its $32.9 billion
in revenue from iPhone sales this year is 26% greater than the same
period in 2014. And the 51.2 million devices represents a  17%
increase.In other words, iPhone revenue and unit sales have grown 26% and
17%, respectively, over the last two years, which is a very
impressive compound annualized growth rate for a company of this
size. Therefore, consider that 2016 is an ""s"" year, and that the 7
and 7Plus are sure to be superior launches. And then, realize that
Apple does not need to discount unit prices.The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy
    NowThe fact is that iPhone sales are still very, very strong.A couple other things to considerWhen you really think about it, AAPL would be insane to reduce
iPhone prices. Yes, services are growing at a 20% annual rate, but
account for just under 12% of total revenue versus 65% of total
revenue from iPhones. Therefore, if AAPL bets wrong on iPhone
prices, it could cause far more harm than good to total
revenue.In addition, if AAPL reduces iPhone prices, margins are going to
fall, therefore earnings per share are going to fall, and there is
no guarantee that it can gain enough new market share to counter
these reductions. Lastly, once a company reduces prices for primary
products and services, it is kind of an admission of defeat, and is
very difficult to come back from.Specifically, how does Apple then raise prices if it reduces
them?I think it would be an immature, short-sighted move on behalf of
Apple management, and is thereby virtually impossible.The fact is that it would do more harm to Apple stock than good,
because at the end of the day, iPhone sales are fine and Apple
stock will be better than ever once the iPhone 7, 7 Plus launch
proves all doubters wrong.As of this writing, Brian Nichols was long AAPL.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Tech Stocks … Of 2020!30 Stocks the Smart Money Just Bought or

Western Digital Corp (WDC): Are Solid State Drive Makers a Solid Investment?;5/26/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsConsolidation in the tech industry - especially in the world
  of big tech - isn't new, but also isn't slowing down. And while
  there are many drivers of big-time deals, such asSeagate Technology PLC(STX) andWestern Digital Corp(WDC), actual shifts in technology can be key drivers.Consider the computer industry. In the 1980s, the age of the
  central processing unit was born. But as CPUs increased in speed,
  the complexity and size of the programs being run on them also
  increased. And it took some time for hard drive disks to catch up
  with that speed.makeArticleAd();In recent years, solid-state drives have addressed that issue.
  They don't just speed up activity either - they can also reduce
  noise and heat, consume less power, occupy less space and are
  more resistant to physical damage.Before SSDs really caught on, the hard drive market was
  already undergoing dramatic consolidation.SanDisk Corporation(SNDK) - one of the two biggest players - bought a company called
  Fusion-io, STX boughtSamsung's (SSNLF) hard-drive business, WDC bought HGST Technologies, OCZ was
  bought byToshiba(TOSBF) and the list goes on.Why WDC and STX Dominance Isn't a BenefitNow, leaders in the hard-drive space have been scrambling to
  snag some SSD market share. While Western Digital and Seagate own
  around 90% of the HDD market, that's not going to do them any
  good, as enterprises move away from the technology, or even to a
  hybrid model.30 Stocks the Smart Money Just Bought or
      DumpedBecause they've been late to the SSD party, these companies
  have, again, taken the acquisition route to acquire said
  market share. SanDisk agreed to a $19 billion merger with WDC a
  few months ago, while STX turned to Dot Hill Systems - a company
  I had actually recommended to subscribers before the deal.The question now is whether these hardware companies are good
  investments after their big buys. In my opinion, front running
  the acquisition was the way to go, but I'm not excited or
  optimistic enough to pull the trigger post-purchase.The SSD market is quite competitive and it will get even more
  competitive as prices continue to fall. SSD prices fall an
  average of 30% per year thanks to Moore's Law. Meanwhile, these
  hardware giants are playing catch-up in the space as technology
  continues to evolve.Just as I did with Dot Hill Systems, the best strategy is to
  keep an eye on companies that could be acquisition targets,
  instead of the big-name companies like WDC and STX. If a hardware
  giant has gotten too far behind its peers due to slowing sales
  and Wall Street's fickle moods, someone is going to make a
  bid.To find such targets, look for obviously depressed companies
  that are already showing signs of recovery. Do not try to chase a
  tech stock down, as a falling knife removes much of the urgency
  around the negotiating table and it can make sellers more
  desperate, cutting into the price.While the newly merged entities could offer more upside, I
  would only ride that wave if you were in before the
  consolidation. And I wouldn't be opposed to betting on the
  merger, then getting out soon after.The tech industry in general is fickle and fast moving.
  Playing consolidation can be promising, but riding a
  late-to-the-party hardware maker too long can leave investors
  disappointed.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority. She is an accomplished investment specialist and market

How Will Apple and Samsung Weather the Coming Smartphone Market Fallout?;5/25/2016;"Source: Samsung.If you thought slowing smartphone sales had hurt tech earnings
  so far this year, to quote the '70s rock outfit Bachman-Turner
  Overdrive , ""you ain't seen nothing yet.""The gradual maturing of the global smartphone market,
  evidenced by its first-ever period of effectively flat growth in
  the first quarter,  has arguably been the most important
  tech industry story so far in 2016.makeArticleAd();And if recent signals are to be believed, smartphone powers
  likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) ,Xiaomi, and others could be experiencing a rough second quarter.From bad to worse?One way the analyst community attempts to gauge the
  forthcoming financial performance of handset makers is by
  analyzing the companies that supply their components and build
  their devices.As the thinking goes, the earnings results and guidance from
  the smartphone supply chain can serve as a leading indicator
  about the level of demand names like Apple and Samsung see for
  their devices. Unfortunately, if recent reports are to be
  believed, investors should be very concerned indeed.During their Q1 earnings reports, an alarmingly large number
  of smartphone supply chain companies signaled their businesses
  are experiencing smartphone-related weakness in some way shape or
  form. Among them:Japan Displayswitched its 2016 profit forecast to a loss and scrapped
    its previously announced plans to initiate a dividend.Sharp's CEO stated orders from large smartphone OEMs
    decelerated noticeably in Q4 2015.Smartphone assemblerPegatronsaw its Q1 profits fall 35%, well short of analysts'
    expectations. Its April sales also sharply contracted, falling
    16% year-over-year.Apple assembly partnerFoxconn's Q1 profits dropped by 9.2% compared to the prior
    year.iPhone images sensor supplierSonystated demand for its smartphone components has proven weaker
    than expected, though it will likely increase in the second
    half of the year.Nidec, which supplies the haptic components that enable Apple's
    Force Touch, also saw Q1 profits decline by 18% on -- surprise!
    -- weaker than expected demand.Since component suppliers need to produce their wares ahead of
  the production cycle of their handset customers, slowing demand
  from a component supplier in one quarter can precede a similar
  slowdown for the larger consumer-electronics name in the next
  quarter.Though certainly not fault-proof, such a sweeping breakdown in
  market-wide fundamentals strongly suggests major smartphone
  makers like Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi are experiencing slowing
  demand for their goods in the near term. As such, it seems fair
  to expect that the current quarter could be experiencing
  continued weakness in the sales of many major smartphone brands,
  though there can certainly be exceptions to any trend -- likeSamsung's strong Q1, for example. The more important question for investors is, how
  long will this trend last?Better days ahead?While the smartphone market's best days of growth almost
  assuredly lie behind  it, the second half of this year will
  also likely prove better than the first for Apple and Samsung,
  though to varying degrees.Source: AppleApple's bull thesis is undoubtedly more clear-cut here. As we
  all know, the iPhone 7's form factor upgrade should help drive a
  holiday-season upgrade cycle. This is assuming the iPhone 7
  maintains Apple's long-standing design leadership. (Likely, but
  not a given.) Past iPhone form factor updates enjoyed an
  appreciable tailwind thanks to market-wide growth, each of the
  past three iPhone upgrade cycles has been accompanied by sales
  andstock price increasesfor the Mac maker.Unlike Apple, Samsung has already refreshed its flagship
  handsets this year, and thankfully, the devices appear to be
  winners in their own rights. Lauded by reviewers and selling well
  so far this year, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are some of
  Samsung's best high-end smartphones in recent memory.  As
  such, it also follows that Samsung stands to benefit among
  Android handset OEMs going into the all-important holiday season
  for consumer electronics purchases.The halcyon days of unfettered smartphone market growth will
  likely never return.  However, the companies that stand the
  best chance of competing for market share within a mature market
  are likely those offering the best devices. So while the news
  around the smartphone market has been quite grizzly so far this
  year, the second half of the year will likely prove better, a

2016 Hasn't Been a Great Year for Apple So Far;5/25/2016;"Perhaps you've already noticed, butApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) having a fairly drab year so far. Sure, the
  company's stock is down about about 7% since the beginning of the
  year, but there's much more to it than that.Apple's had some bad news in few of its product categories
  over the past five months, and some of the company's biggest
  prospects are having a hard time gaining traction.makeArticleAd();Let's take a quick look at how the company's year is going so
  far:iPhone sales slippedIt's no secret that Apple's iPhone sales fell in fiscal Q2 by
  16% year-over-year, the company's first-ever year drop since the
  device debuted. Most of the problems stem from stagnating
  demand in China, where iPhone sales were down 26%
  year-over-year.The news wasn't all that surprising considering Apple
  mentioned back in January that iPhone sales would slow, but that
  didn't make news any easier to swallow for investors.The success of the iPhone 6 last year made it difficult for
  the 6s to outperform its sales numbers, but it's hard to know
  right now whether thenext iPhonewill bring sales back to their usual levels, or if lower sales
  are the new normal.Apple Watch gets a price cutApple entered the wearables market just over a year ago, and
  so far it's doing pretty well. The company currently holds the
  No. 1 position for smartwatch sales and is the No. 2 worldwide
  wearable tech vendor, according to IDC.But Apple made a curious move in March when it announced $50,
  or 14%, price cut for the Apple Watch. Despite the company making
  some positive inroads into wearables, the price cut is clearly a
  move to spur sales.It's not unprecedented for Apple to drop the price of a new
  device (it shaved $200 off the original iPhone price a few months
  after it launched), but it still indicates that Apple many be
  unhappy with the number of Apple Watch sales.Chromebooks overtake MacsIn the first quarter of this year Chromebook shipments
  surpassed Mac shipments for the first time ever.Most of this came from increasing Chromebook sales in the U.S.
  to the K-12 education market. Chromebooks outpacing Mac shipments
  for one quarter could be a short-lived story, but it's worth
  mentioning that Google just announced Android apps will soon be
  able to run on the Chrome OS, which could spur even more interest
  among consumers.The news is by no means damning for Apple but is a setback
  considering Apple CEO Tim Cook says that Chromebooks are simply
  ""test machines"" for school kids.Apple's struggling in new growth marketsAnd last, but not least, Apple is struggling to get its
  footing in the potentially lucrative smartphone market in
  India.India rejected Apple's request to sell refurbished iPhones in
  the country. The country's government also recently said Apple
  won't receive an exemption on the high taxes it's set on iPhones
  because they're not made with at least 30% of locally sourced
  materials.That's bad news because the iPhone's average selling price in
  the country is about 253% higher thanSamsung's devices -- which is the No. 1 vendor in the country.Apple's struggles in India come at a time where the country
  will soon become the second-largest smartphone market in the
  word. And with iPhone sales slipping in the current
  second-biggest smartphone market -- the U.S. -- Apple is in need
  of finding a new country where it can increase sales.It's not all badApple could turn things around in the second half of this
  year, of course. These problems could all be fixed over time with
  the right strategies.Apple's services revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $6
  billion, and the company ended fiscal Q2 with $233 billion in
  cash and marketable securities. Additionally, sales from the
  quarter didn't include the company's latest iPhone SE release, so
  we'll have to wait until next quarter to see if those help prop
  up iPhone sales.Apple could certainly turn things around the rest of this
  year, but the problems listed above certainly should give
  investors some concern as Apple seeks to grow in the post-PC and
  soon-to-be post-mobile era.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of

Why Are Apple's Japanese Margins The Highest Among Its Geographic Segments?;5/25/2016;"Apple (AAPL) margins in Japan were roughly 13% higher than the rest of the
world during fiscal 2015. Below, we outline some factors that are
likely causing this.Apple products are priced higher in Japan compared to
  the United States. For example, the iPhone 6S is priced at
  a ~10% premium to U.S. prices.Apple likely has good control over distribution,
  since it runs its own retail and online stores in Japan,
  unlike some other Asian markets where it relies on
  third-parties. Shipping costs could also be lower,
  since iPhones and other products are assembled in nearby
  China.It's also possible that Apple sells a higher mix of high-end
  devices in Japan, given the country's tech savvy
  consumers.Services such as the App Store are seeing strong growth
  in Japan. This is likely to be accretive for Apple's Japanese
  margins.Apple enjoys very strong brand recognition and high
  market share in the Japanese mobile market (~50% as of
  Jan 2016). This potentially reduces marketing and
  promotional spending as a percentage of sales.See Our Complete Analysis For Apple HeremakeArticleAd();View Interactive Institutional

Is Apple Inc. Wrong About India?;5/25/2016;"You've probably noticedApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  has increased its focus on India lately. The
  iPhone maker has been wooing the country for the past few years
  and Apple CEO Tim Cook recently ramped that up with a business
  trip to India.Apple is doing everything it can to make India its next big
  growth market. And there are plenty of good reasons for this.makeArticleAd();The first being that India is expected to overtake the U.S. as
  the second-largest smartphone market next year, and is currently
  growing 5 times faster than China's smartphone market.But selling phones in India isn't easy. Government regulations
  and low average selling prices (ASPs) are stifling Apple's
  progress.Apple sees massive smartphone potential in one of the world's
  most populous countries, but is the company wrong to think it can
  succeed there?The problem with Apple in IndiaApple's problems in India can be summed up with just two
  simple facts: iPhones are too expensive and the company is
  struggling to bring down their price in the country.The average selling price for an iPhone in India is $612. The
  high price tag comes partly from Apple's famously high margins,
  but also because India charges more in taxes for devices that
  don't have 30% of their components sourced in its country. Apple
  asked for an exception from this, but the country recentlydeniedthat request.Meanwhile,Samsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) smartphone ASP in India is just $173. That
  means Apple's phones are253%more expensive, on average, than Samsung's. Not many Americans
  would pay for that price difference and in India, where wages are
  substantially lower, it's even harder to convince consumers.Perhaps that price difference is why Samsung is sitting at the
  top of the smartphone vendor list in India with 26.6% market
  share, while Apple holds just 1.9%.India'smiddle class is growing, which could eventually help Apple's iPhone sales in the
  country, but it's not helping much right now.Apple knows its phones are expensive for Indian consumers, and
  that's why it recently requested to sell refurbished devices in
  the country. But India has so far rejected that request, which
  only adds to Apple's problems.Apple doesn't have a choiceThere are few reasons why Apple continues trudging along with
  its India strategy despite its current position.As I mentioned earlier, India will become the second-largest
  smartphone market, behind China, very soon. On top of that, Apple
  is facingslowing iPhones salesin the U.S.The iPhone accounts for about 65% of Apple's total revenue. So
  if the company wants to continue using the devices as its main
  revenue stream, it'll have to look to new markets that are
  growing quickly -- like India.Investors may not want to hear thisEven if Apple does eventually see an uptick in smartphone
  sales in India, it's not likely that it will experience the same
  type of success we've seen for the company in the U.S. or
  China.India is a country with a growing population and economic
  position, but the average yearly income in India is just under
  $1,600, according to the World Bank. No matter what Apple
  does strategically to sell iPhones, it can't change that
  fact. Apple will have to settle for whatever market share it
  can scrape together until India becomes more wealthy.The problem for Apple is it needs to sell more iPhonesnow,but Indian consumers just aren't ready.It's not that Apple is wrong in looking to India for more
  smartphone growth, it's just that the iPhone's price tag is
  essentially an insurmountable hurdle right now, and
  nearly everything the company's done to change that hasn't
  worked.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of

Who Is Apple's Favorite Customer?;5/25/2016;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has become a cultural touchstone around the world,
  as familiar as any other global brand. The iPhone-maker now has
  over 1 billion installed devices globally, and more than half of
  American households own at least one Apple product.The company has long had a reputation for being popular among
  hipsters, a notion that Apple and rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)  have each reinforced through marketing.
  Apple has successfully presented itself as a species distinct
  from other device makers with ad campaigns such as ""Think
  Different."" Conversely Samsung's commercials have depicted Apple
  devices as followers, mocking the fanboy cult around the
  company.Apple is also known for being popular among techies as
  research by Crittercism said that San Francisco and New York, had
  a high proportion of Apple users with 80% of San Franciscans
  choosing an iOS device, while ""lower-tech"" cities like Phoenix
  and Detroit found Android more popular.makeArticleAd();Yet, another study seemed to contradict both of the above
  stereotypes. Slice Intelligence found that the highest-spending
  Apple customer in the US was in fact, a man over the age of 65.
  That demographic shelled out an average of $976 between October
  2014 to September 2015, compared to the national average spend of
  $788.The study found that spending tends to increase with age --
  perhaps as earnings and disposable income also increase -- and it
  also showed that men outspent women by a considerable margin. Men
  on average spent $897, compared to just $633 for women, and women
  18-24 spent the least. Slice theorized that the spending by older
  Americans may be because they tend to be on the late side of the
  adoption curve. They could be new buyers, or alternatively,
  are shopping for Apple products as gifts. The survey also found
  seniors were among the greatest purchasers of iPads, while the
  25-34 demographic led purchases of iPhones and Macs.Another study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners
  found that nearly half of iPhone buyers are repeat customers,
  upgrading from an old iPhone. The study also showed that Apple
  attracted three times as many Samsung customers to switch to iOS,
  as Samsung did to Apple.Globally, Apple now sells more iPhones in China than in any
  other country, making the world's second-biggest economy its most
  important market. Regionally, Apple draws about a third of
  its sales from the Americas, with Europe, Middle East, and Africa
  contributing another 22%. Asia delivers the balance, and by
  market share, the iPhone is most dominant in Japan.A company like Apple can't really have a single favorite
  customer as you don't grow to $200 billion in annual revenue
  without mass appeal. However, if there was a composite figure of
  its most important customer, it would probably be young,
  affluent, upwardly mobile, Chinese males. As Apple attempts to
  swing back to growth in the world's most populous country,
  targeting that consumer is likely to yield the greatest
  benefit.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one
    of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

The Galaxy S7 and Facebook Could Benefit from Samsung's Newest Device;5/22/2016;"Samsung's Gear 360. Source: Samsung.Samsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) next major product isn't a smartphone or a
  TV.Late last month, the hardware giant released its first virtual
  reality camera, the Gear 360, in its home market of Korea, and
  plans to bring it to the U.S. and Europe in the coming weeks. The
  Gear 360 certainly isn't the first VR camera on the market, but
  it's far more affordable than many of its rivals, and it should
  make it possible for average consumers to create and share
  virtual reality content.makeArticleAd();That should help bothFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it may even lead to
  some additional Galaxy S7 sales.A new type of cameraAbout 80% of Americans now own smartphones,  and
  virtually all are capable of taking pictures and recording video.
  But no modern smartphone can record a video designed for VR, and
  taking a VR photo is cumbersome and difficult. If VR is going to
  emerge as the next great medium, consumers will need new sorts of
  cameras to create content.Enter the Gear 360. Resembling a large golf ball, the device
  is equipped with two wide-angle lenses. That allows it to take
  photos and record video across a full 360 degrees. In Korea, the
  Gear 360 retails for about 400,000 won, or about $340. U.S. and
  European pricing has not been confirmed, but somewhere between
  $300 and $400 seems likely.Other virtual reality cameras are out there, but most are an
  order of magnitude more expensive.GoPro's Odyssey retails for about $15,000, for example, while its
  upcoming Omni goes for $5,000. There are cheaper options, such as
  the Ricoh Theta S and the recently releasedLG360 CAM, but they lack Samsung's reputation, branding, and
  massive marketing budget, and don't feed into Samsung's
  burgeoning VR ecosystem.Acompellingaccessory for the Galaxy S7You won't need a Galaxy S7 to use the Gear 360. It's capable
  of working as a stand-alone device. The videos and pictures it
  takes can be sent to an internal SD card, and can be transferred
  to a Windows PC and ultimately shared online. But if you do
  happen to own a Galaxy S7, it will sync with your handset,
  allowing you to use it as a sort of remote control. Moreover,
  once you've recorded photos and videos, you'll need some way to
  view them. Samsung's Gear VR headset stands as the most obvious
  solution.When Samsung reported earnings late last month, it said sales
  of its Galaxy S7 came in stronger than the company had
  anticipated. Perhaps consumers were enticed by the phone's
  waterproofing or its microSD card slot, but many may have been
  attracted by the prospect of experiencing VR. To date,
  Samsung's Gear has a near monopoly on high-quality,
  affordable VR experiences, as competing headsets like Facebook's
  Oculus Rift retail for many hundreds of dollars and require
  more-powerful-than-usual PCs to operate properly.Facebook and Google are committed to VR
    contentBut ultimately, the companies that could benefit the most from
  the Gear 360 are Google and Facebook, as they vie to own the
  networks where VR content will be shared. Last fall, Facebook
  added VR support to its News Feed, allowing publishing partners
  and users to share 360-degree videos. When a Gear 360 is paired
  with a Galaxy S7, users can upload the videos they've taken with
  it directly to Facebook.Google's commitment stretches back even further -- it added
  support for 360-degree YouTube videos early last year. Earlier
  this month, at Google I/O, the company announced Daydream, a VR
  initiative that promises to make many future Android phones VR
  compatible. In conjunction with Daydream, Google will release a
  version of the YouTube app designed specifically for VR headsets.
  Traditional videos could benefit from a more intimate viewing
  experience, but adding more 360-degree videos would make VR
  YouTube far more compelling.VR headsets are far from ubiquitous, but they're out there.
  The cameras needed to make VR content, however, are considerably
  more rare. The Gear 360 may ultimately be the most revolutionary
  new product Samsung releases this year, helping bring VR content
  creation to the mainstream.There's something big happening this FridayI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of

million units during 2015 amounted to about 1% of India's total
smartphone market. Even after offering discounts of up to $500 on

2014, but it has no branded retail presence.If there's a stumbling block, it's infrastructure. 3G technology
is still the norm and only about a quarter of the population has a

programs.Indonesia is a member of the G-20, and Apple should be doing
business there. Think hearts, minds and infrastructure … plus 260

while out on the beach - so it's time for a roundup of gadgets that
will make the sun, sand and surf even more enjoyable.Source: KoboThe Coolest Cooler was set to be the best gadget ever for
beachgoers when it raised $13 million on Kickstarter. A cooler with
wide, sand-friendly tires, built-in blender, a waterproof Bluetooth
speaker, USB charger, an LED light and its own bottle opener?makeArticleAd();Sounded great, but unfortunatelyit imploded in a spectacular fashionand has turned into a Kickstarter cautionary tale.Many of those ideas were solid - you definitely want things like
a cooler and a Bluetooth speaker for the beach - but trying to jam
them all into a single uber gadget is not the best approach.Summer Gadget Guide: The 5 Best Drones for Any
    BudgetHere are 10 gadgets that are guaranteed to improve your summer
beach experience.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Samsung Galaxy
ActiveSource: SamsungYou don't want to be without your smartphone, even on the beach,
but sand and water are a combination that will make short work of
these delicate devices.Every year,Samsung(SSNLF) releases an ""Active"" version of its popular Galaxy smartphone.
It's ""ruggedized"", dust-proof, water-resistant and has a larger
battery, making it perfect for checking e-mail or updating
something on any ofFacebook Inc's(FB) platforms while relaxing by the ocean.The last official version was the Galaxy S6 Active, but Samsungaccidentally spilled the beanson a forthcoming Galaxy S7 Active. The regular Galaxy S7 will
definitely fare better than anythingApple Inc.(AAPL) offers, but if you can spring for an Active version (once it hits
shelves), you should be covered for just about anything a day at
the beach can throw at you.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Dog & Bone
Wetsuit Impact CaseSource: Dog & BoneIf you carry an iPhone, you need to protect it if you're going
to take it to the beach.Rumors have the iPhone 7 being waterproof, but the iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6s definitely are not. Splashing, blowing sand and hits by
errant Frisbees will quickly reduce your favorite gadget to a hunk
of junk destined to meetLiam, Apple's recycling robot.Fortunately, there are many protective cases to choose from.I've been impressed by theWetsuit Impact Case, available for iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus. It's made by
Australian company,Dog & Bone… is there anyone out there who would know beach
conditions better than Australians? The Wetsuit Impact Case
provides protection from bumps, water, dirt, sand and even snow (in
case you want to check out a beach in Antarctica).The rubberized case is stylish and the textured rubber makes it
easier to grip, even with wet hands.Summer Gadget Guide: The Best Tablets for Kids

glass screen protector doesn't distort your display, and there's
even a thin membrane over the Home button so Touch ID works.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Margaritaville
Explorer Cordless Frozen Concoction MakerSource: MargaritavilleOne thing the Coolest Cooler had right was the idea of a
portable blender.While a cheeseburger in Paradise is nice, I think sipping on a
frozen beverage, while sitting in the hot sun and watching the
waves hit the beach, is even better.And who would be better qualified to tackle this scenario than
Jimmy Buffett? As part of his beach party empire, theMargaritavilleExplorer Cordless Frozen ConcoctionMaker lets you shave ice and blend up to 60 drinks - 20 pitchers -
on a single charge.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: GoPro Hero
SessionSource: GoProBeaches are home to the kind of activities that are made for an
action camera: surfing, snorkeling, water skiing, para sailing …
you get the idea.GoPro Inc(GPRO) is still at the top when it comes to action cameras, and theGoPro Hero Sessionis its most affordable and compact device yet.Waterproof to 33 feet, one-button controls, Full HD video and
the option of 100-frames-per-second slow motion means you can
capture all the action.Summer Gadget Guide: Portable Wireless Speakers
    for Your Outdoors BashThe tiny cube measures only 1.5-inches on a side, so you can
attach it virtually anywhere, and ""lugging"" this tiny gadget from
the car to your spot in the sand is a matter of slipping it in a
pocket.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Fugoo Tough XL
Bluetooth SpeakerSource: FugooIf you're going to be camped out on the beach all day, you need
tunes.Thankfully, the days of boom boxes that need 10 D-Cell batteries
(and blow through them in two or three hours) are long gone.
With a portable Bluetooth speaker, you don't need anything but your
smartphone to play hours of beach-friendly music.There are thousands of Bluetooth speakers out there, but the
best portable speaker I've found for this situation is theFugooTough
XL.This thing packs eight drivers, 38-Watts of power and 360-degree
sound into a case designed to survive being run over by a dune
buggy. It's IP67 waterproof, sandproof and pretty much everything-proof (as part of a review, I even tossed one in a snowbank, where it kept playing without
missing a beat).The battery will last an incredible 35 hours at 50% volume, and
a USB output port lets you us it recharge your mobile devices.In addition to doing double-duty as a speakerphone, you can even
use the Fugoo Tough XL to access Siri and Google Now, so you don't
have to touch your smartphone screen with those greasy sunscreen
fingers when you want to check the weather forecast.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: UE Roll Bluetooth
SpeakerSource: Ultimate EarsIf you want music in a package that's a little more compact and
maybe a bit more ""beachy"" in appearance, then theUE RollfromLogitech International SA (USA)'s(LOGI) Ultimate Ears division is a popular choice.The UE Roll is colorful (there are lots of funky options to
choose from), compact, has 9-hour battery life and it's waterproof.
Sound isn't anything near to what that Fugoo can put out, but it's
a heck of a lot better than your smartphone's built-in speakers.
The UE Roll also has an extended 65-foot Bluetooth range, so you
can take it in the water and leave that smartphone safely back at
the chairs.The 10 Ways You Will Watch TV by 2020Buy it directly from UE's website and they'll even throw in an
inflatable ""Floatie"" life preserver for it, so the UE Roll floats
in the water with you.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Kobo Aura H20Source: KoboListening to music is big, but reading, one of the other most
popular beach activities, can also be improved through use of
gadgets.For years, bringing a dog-eared novel to read while relaxing in
a lounger, surrounded by sand and waves, was the ultimate in
vacation relaxation for many people. With an e-reader, you're not
just limited to a single book - you can bring your entire digital
library with you. And unlike a tablet, text on an e-reader looks
evenbetterin sunlight, and battery life won't be an issue.When it comes to beach-friendly e-readers,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(AMZN) Kindle line is out. Unless you're stuck on the Kindle format (in
which case you'd better try to find a waterproof case for your
Kindle), theKobo Aura H2Ofrom Japan'sRakuten Inc(RKUNF) is the way to go.You get a high resolution, 6.8-inch display in a premium
e-reader with 11 different fonts in 24 different sizes to choose
from. All of this is in a package that is dustproof and waterproof
- I dunked a Kobo Aura H2O in a foot of water aspart of a review, so I can attest to the fact that it should survive anything a
beach visit can throw at it.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: DJI Phantom 2
DroneSource: DJIFlying a kite at the beach is so 1950s. The new version of this
longtime favorite activity uses one of the hottest gadgets around:
a drone.TheDJIPhantom 2is a few generations behind the latest Phantom 4 drone, so you will
not get all the latest features like ActiveTrack or a built-in
4K camera.However, the Phantom 2 is still a very impressive drone, and its
price has been cut to $339, which is a considerable savings
compared to the $1,399 Phantom 4.It's not cheap enough that you wouldn't be upset if you
accidentally ditched it in the ocean, but add your own GoPro camera
and imagine the aerial footage you could get. You could also keep
an eye on the kids in the water without having to leave the comfort
of your chair.7 Companies That Are Doing Wonders With AIJust make sure to check local rules and regulations before
launching, as not all beaches permit visitors to buzz the crowds
from above. Also, fellow beachgoers enjoying an outing in their
bathing suits may not appreciate your hovering camera, so be
prepared for some conversations if you decide to play pilot.10 Best Tech Gadgets to Take to the Beach: Lightspeed Quick
Shelter Beach TentSource: LightspeedEnjoying the beach naturally involves a lot of sun, but spendingallday under those blazing rays can be a little too much. That's why a
beach tent is such a great idea.TheLightspeedQuick Shelter Beach Tenthas an easy-to-use top-pull hub system, so you can get it set up in
seconds. There's room inside for two chairs, the fabric offers UPF
50+ protection, as well as hard-to-find shade and there are two
large mesh windows for airflow.It's lightweight, packs up into an easy-to-carry bag and uses
pockets you fill with sand to keep it in place.The only thing that would make this shelter perfect (if you're
willing to carry a little more gear and spring for some D-cells) is
thisbattery-powered ceiling fan… and a few frosty beverages from that Frozen Concoction

Apple Inc.: Apple Watch 2 Rumor Roundup;5/17/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAny hopes thatApple Inc.(AAPL) might follow the same yearly upgrade cycle with the Apple Watch
that it does with its iPhones were dashed back in March. Instead of
a new smartwatch, Apple offered up some new bands and a price
cut.Source: AppleHowever, the smart money is on AAPL finally taking the wraps off
theApple
Watchreplacement in the fall. Here's what we think we know about
the upcoming Apple Watch 2.makeArticleAd();Apple Watch S?Will the second-generation Apple smartwatch be the Apple
Watch 2, or the Apple Watch S? While the current model is in need
of significant upgrades, it's possible Apple could follow the
strategy adopted with the iPhone and make every other release an
""S"" version.In that case, the new smartwatch would look identical to
the previous model, but incorporate incremental improvements.The 10 Ways You Will Watch TV by 2020WithFitbit Inc(FIT) still going strong and making moves into the smartwatch space, I
think Apple realizes it needs to up its game and will skip the ""S""
strategy to release a full-on Apple Watch 2.ThinnerThere's no denying the fact that the current AAPL Watch is
chunky. Look at its profile compared to say, aPebbleTime Round, and it looks even heftier. Apple has always been
obsessed with making everything thinner, so expect designers to be
working hard to shave a few millimeters off the thickness of the
Apple Watch 2.More Powerful CPUProbably the single most frustrating thing for the majority of
Apple Watch owners is its pokey performance. As a watch with
notifications, everything works as expected. Launch an app,
however, and be prepared to wait. A more powerful CPU is high on
the must-have list for this wearable to live up to
expectations.Cellular ConnectivityThe AAPL Watch relies on an iPhone for much of its
functionality. The rumor mill has been filling with reports that
Apple may beputting a cellular radio in the Apple Watch 2. Doing so would let users track distance using GPS, stream Apple
Music, receive texts and e-mail, and make calls - without needing
to carry their iPhone.Samsung(SSNLF) and some other smartwatch makers have already offered this with
limited consumer interest, but making it an optional feature may
win the Apple Watch more fans from the Fitbit crowd.Battery LifeEveryone complains about Apple Watch battery life, but the
reality is it's more than enough to get through a day for most
people and that's good enough. At least for now. If Apple has any
hope of making the AAPL Watch 2 slimmer and more powerful,
something has to give.Battery technology moves slowly and even shaving space with a
thinner OLED display to add more battery capacity would likely be a
wash if an overall slimmer case and more powerful CPU are
coming. So, I would not expect to see any significant improvement
in battery life, especially if cellular connectivity is added to
the mix.More BandsApple has been pretty open about the fact that the Apple Watch
isn't just a device - it's an accessory. Bands have been the big
add-on, the relatively inexpensive way to transform an Apple Watch
from a sporty fitness tracker to a fashionableHermes(HESAF) timepiece.WhateverAAPL does with the Apple Watch 2, expect to see a slew of new
bands released too.Release DateThe original Apple Watch went on sale in April 2015, which madeApple's March eventa likely announcement point for its replacement (assuming a
one-year product cycle like the iPhone). Obviously, that
didn't happen.Most analysts are now expecting a fall release of the AAPL Watch
2, with an announcement as part of the annual iPhone event in
September. That's a 1.5-year product cycle and perfect timing for
Apple to drum up excitement in time for the holiday shopping
season.Apple Watch Review: Does watchOS 2 Make it
    Better?There is a possibility we might see the second-generation Apple
smartwatch sooner, though.Quanta Computer(QUCPF) manufactures Apple's smartwatch and a senior official from that
company toldTechRadartheApple Watch 2 was expected in Q2 2016. That timeframe would line up with June'sWWDC 2016for Apple to make the announcement.Apple Watch 2 PriceAAPL Watch models currently have prices ranging from $299 to
$17,000. The company has already slashed the entry-level price from
$349 to $299 and that is actually competitive with most
full-featured smartwatches.Even though Apple would probably like to goose Apple Watch 2
sales above what it's accomplished with the original, it also loves
its margins. Expect Apple to hold the line, keep pricing at
existing levels and push new features to make the case for buying
an Apple Watch 2.As usual with AAPL, we'll have to wait until it finally
announces its second-generation smartwatch before any of these
details are confirmed. There is also no guarantee the company will
actually swing that fall release, but the chances are high enough
that I wouldn't be plunking cash down on an original Apple Watch at
this point, even with that $50 discount.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in

Samsung's Galaxy S7 Is Succeeding Where Apple's iPhones Are Not;5/4/2016;"""It's True: Samsung's Galaxy S7 Is Better Than the iPhone""-- Fortune, March 14, 2016makeArticleAd();""Samsung Galaxy S7 Review: Head of the Smartphone Class""-The Wall Street Journal, March 8, 2016Source: Samsung/There's been no shortage of positive commentary regardingSamsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge since they launched this year. As you
    can see from the headlines above, the phones are notching
    better press thanApple's iPhone 6s. But as investors, we care about real-world data.
    Now, with Samsung's recent earnings report, we have official
    word that sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge helped push
    earnings higher.Galaxy S7 powers Samsung's beatThe South Korean electronics juggernaut released earnings late
    last week, providing one of its more impressive performances in
    recent memory. For the quarter, here's how the main income
    statement line items performed.MetricQ1 2016Q1 2015% ChangeSamsung revenue$43.31$40.996%Samsung operating profit$5.81$5.2012%Samsung net income$4.57$4.0313%Info source: Samsung. Chart by author. Dollar amounts in
    billions.According to the company, ""The first quarter saw overall
    earnings growth led by the early launch and successful sales of
    the flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, improved memory product
    mix, expanded 14nm supply of System LSI products, and increased
    sales of OLED panels.""Looking out to the rest of the year, Samsung said it expects
    its handset division to produce strong sales and profit growth,
    largely thanks to the outsize popularity of the Galaxy S7 and
    S7 Edge, along with improved profitability of its non-premium
    devices. The company declined to provide specific S7 and S7
    Edge sales data, but analysts estimate Samsung shipped roughly
    10 million units of its flagship smartphone during Q1, roughly
    30%-40% higher than many initial forecasts, and putting it on
    pace to do better than previous models.Analysts are quick to note that shipments aren't the same as
    sales to end consumers, which could mean the current sales
    totals sit lower even than the 10 million estimate. It's
    also important to point out that the latest smartphones enjoyed
    both timing and pricing advantages compared with past Galaxy
    device family launches.The company launched the latest Galaxy models a month
    earlier than last year's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. They also cost
    slightly less than last year's Galaxy and enjoy new
    consumer-friendly features such as highly water-resistant
    casing and a slot for additional external memory. Even with the
    tailwinds, the market and review data seems to fairly support
    the idea that Samsung's latest flagship smartphones are indeed
    a resounding hit, which ups the ante considerably for Apple's
    upcoming iPhone 7.Source: Apple.Can Apple answer?Taken in concert with Apple's iPhone sales contracting for the
    first time ever year-over-year in the latest quarter, the
    better-than-expected success of Samsung's flagship smartphones
    paints the Korean smartphone giant as the firm with more
    momentum at the moment between the longtime rivals.Given the strength of its rival's premium devices and the
    weakness of its own smartphone sales, Apple badly needs to
    regain some of its device leadership.Apple's most recent product updates haven't held the same
    magical aura of years past. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus offer
    modest improvements over the iPhone 6. The iPhone SE contains
    most of Apple's high-end hardware, but nothing new other than
    its smaller 4-inch form factor. The recently introduced
    9.7-inch iPad Pro offered some nice hardware upgrades but also
    lacked a true ""wow"" factor. Similarly, Apple quietly introduced
    an updated MacBook with improved innards but no new killer
    feature to speak of. The second-generation Apple Watch remains
    forthcoming. Are you sensing a trend here?Over the past year, the improvements to Apple's suite of
    iProducts have mostly incremental in nature. This could be
    either because Apple has lost its product magic or because the
    true device fireworks are due later this year. It's nearly
    impossible to tell in advance which is the case. However, one
    thing is abundantly clear -- the iPhone 7 had better be
    great.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple Inc. May Fall Behind MediaTek, Qualcomm;5/4/2016;"Image credit: Apple.Applehas earned quite a lot of praise for its chip-design prowess.
    Since its acquisition of P.A. Semiconductor in 2008, it
    arguably has transformed into the leading designer of
    mobile-targeted applications processors.makeArticleAd();During the past two product generations (iPhone 6, iPhone
    6s), Apple has led the transition to new chip-manufacturing
    technologies. Apple's A8 and A8X processors were the first
    applications processors built onTSMC's 20-nanometer manufacturing technology. The Apple A9 was the
    first applications processor available on TSMC's 16-nanometer
    FinFET Plus technology.It would seem, however, that Apple will not lead the charge
    into the next chip-manufacturing technology: 10-nanometers.MediaTek may be the first to TSMC 10-nanometerTSMC has said publicly that it expects to begin to see
    ""sizable"" revenue from its 10-nanometer technology ""starting
    from 2Q 2017 through 2018."" This suggests that TSMC will begin
    to recognize wafer revenue by the end of the second quarter
    (June), implying that wafer production should begin roughly
    three months before then.According to analyst Pan Jiutang (via GSMArena), MediaTek's
    2017 flagship Helio X30 will use a 10-nanometer manufacturing
    technology. Given that the Helio X20/25 launched in Q1 2016/Q2
    2016, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect the X30 to arrive
    in Q1/Q2 of 2017.It is also expected thatQualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 830 will be built on a 10-nanometer
    process. (Samsungis believed to build this chip, though.) The Snapdragon
    830 is expected to arrive in early 2017.The implications for AppleThere are two critical ingredients that define the quality of a
    chip: the manufacturing technology that it's built on, and the
    underlying architecture. Think of the manufacturing technology
    as the canvas, while the architecture is the actual painting.
    All else being equal, a better canvas should mean a better
    painting, but a lousy artist with a great canvas isn't going to
    produce something as good as a great artist with a mediocre
    canvas.Apple's architectures are generally superb, so the
    16-nanometer FinFET+ A10 chip that will debut this year in the
    iPhone 7-series phones may be able to keep up in terms of
    performance with the 10-nanometer Qualcomm and MediaTek chips.
    However, Apple will be tying one hand behind its back, so to
    speak, because the 10-nanometer technology should allow
    MediaTek and Qualcomm to pack in more functionality, and
    deliver better performance than they otherwise would have been
    able to on 14-nanometer/16-nanometer FinFET+.With Qualcomm and MediaTek supplying 10-nanometer chips to
    most of Apple's premium smartphone competitors, Apple risks
    falling behind in chip power efficiency, and potentially,
    performance -- depending on the architectural choices from its
    competitors.It may not be a big deal, but why should Apple risk it?Some might argue that Apple being approximately four-to-five
    months behind in transitioning to a new chip technology isn't
    going to be a big deal for most people. However, I would argue
    that a non-trivial portion of those who purchase premium
    smartphones care about these sorts of things.Additionally, if Apple loses the chip-performance crown
    midway through the iPhone 7 cycle, the reputation for
    chip-technology leadership that Apple has built during the last
    three years -- i.e. first to 64-bit, first to 20-nanometer,
    first to TSMC 16FF+ -- could be damaged.Given all the other areas that Apple seems to be behind in
    these days (display technology, camera quality, etc.), and
    given how desperately Apple needs to make sure its iPhone
    business returns to growth, chip leadership is something that
    the company should strive to maintain.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Is InvenSense Still a Buy?;5/4/2016;"Image source: Invensense.InvenSense(NYSE: INVN) has suffered a series of blows over the past year.
    The company's stock is down more than 44% over the past 12
    months, its motion sensor recently lost a spot inSamsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) flagship Galaxy S smartphone lineup, and
    slowingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone sales could hurt the company's
    revenue.makeArticleAd();All of that sounds pretty bad, and it begs the question
    whether or not this beleaguered tech stock is still a buy.So let's dissect a few key areas of InvenSense's business to
    answer that.What's happening with revenue?First, revenue is moving in the right direction. It's actually
    been growing at a pretty healthy clip, year over year, for the
    past few years. Take a look:Image source: InvenSense.Fiscal 2015 revenue grew 47% year over year, and the year
    before that it was up 21%.So it would appear the company, at least for now, isn't
    having major revenue issues. But if we take a look at
    InvenSense's margins, things don't look as great.Non-GAAP gross margin fell to 44% in FY 2015, down from 51%
    in 2014. That's the lowest it's been since 2009.But things start to look even worse when we see that
    InvenSense's operating margins plummeted in fiscal 2015 to just
    14%, down from 24% in fiscal 2014 -- and way down from the
    previous five years.Image source: InvenSense.To be fair, operating margin has have fallen as InvenSense
    has poured money into its R&D expenses. R&D now
    represents 20% of the company's operating expenses, up from
    just 11% in fiscal 2013. But that's much higher than the
    company wants (it's aiming for R&D at 13% to 15%) and it's
    still unclear whether or not the increase in spending will pay
    off.But there are bigger problemsThe real problem for InvenSense right now is that the company
    is tied so closely to Apple (InvenSense gets about 34% of its
    total revenue from Apple) that the iPhone's recent sales
    slowdown could weigh heavily on the company. Contained within
    the in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are InvenSense's 6-axis
    motion sensors. Slowing iPhone sales equals slowing sensor
    sales.Apple reported in its fiscal Q2 2016 earning this month that
    iPhone sales hadfallen to 51.1 million, down 16% year over year, its first decline ever in iPhone
    unit sales.If Apple continues to suffer iPhone sales declines,
    InvenSense won't be able to resist the negative effect. The
    company's revenue is simply too closely tied to Apple's
    smartphone.And then there's the issue of InvenSense losing a spot in
    Samsung's flagship Galaxy S smartphone lineup. Samsung recently
    passed over InvenSense's 6-axis sensor for the Galaxy S7. Make
    no mistake: that was a big loss. Back in January, InvenSense
    CEO Behrooz Abdi said that the company's second-largest
    revenue contributor (which is Samsung) will dip down to a
    single-digit percentage of revenue. Samsung represents
    about 19% of InvenSense's total revenue, so the drop is
    pretty substantial no matter how you slice it.In short, InvenSense is losing lots of business from two of
    its biggest customers, and it's unclear where it will make up
    those losses.Not much to look forward toInvenSense's yearly revenue (for now) is moving in the right
    direction, but gross margin and operating margin are not.
    Additionally, the company has tied its horse to the Samsung and
    Apple smartphone wagon (both of which are suffering in their
    own way). InvenSense is trying to expand into new revenue
    streams, but it's unclear if can adapt fast enough.iPhones sales could certainly turn around, but that doesn't
    help InvenSense diversify its revenue streams in the long run.
    Additionally, Samsung's long been in adownward spiralwith its mobile prospects and that's only going to continue
    hurting InvenSense.After weighing the evidence, I don't think InvenSense is a
    buy. The company severely needs to diversify itself away from
    Apple and Samsung, and (so far) it doesn't appear to be doing
    that fast enough. This fact, coupled with slowing phone demand
    in the present, make the future look murky at best.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

What to Expect When Universal Display Corporation Reports Earnings;5/3/2016;"Universal Display's lucrative OLED materials. IMAGE SOURCE:
    Universal Display.Universal Display Corporationis set to release first-quarter 2016 results this Thursday, May
    5, after the market close. Shares of the OLED technologist have
    rebounded nicely despite the company'sweaker-than-expected showingin February, with the stock even flirting with all-time highs
    in recent days. And long investors would love nothing more than
    to sustain that momentum with a solid report to kick off a year
    that CFO Sid Rosenblatt described as one ""in which the OLED
    industry builds meaningful new capacity for the continued
    proliferation of OLEDs in the marketplace.""makeArticleAd();But what, exactly, should investors be watching when
    Universal Display's Q1 report hits the wires?First, as far as headline numbers go, Universal Display
    hasn't provided specific financial guidance for the first
    quarter. But it did offer an early look at the full year,
    calling for 2016 revenue to increase 15% year over year, plus
    or minus 5%, resulting in a range of $208.7 million to $230.6
    million. Management also noted that given current manufacturing
    capacity buildouts, the majority of that growth will occur in
    the second half of the year.As such -- and with the caveat that we don't lend much
    credence to Wall Street's near-term demands -- it should come
    as no surprise that analysts' consensus estimates predict
    Universal Display will achieve a breakeven quarter as revenue
    increases a modest 1.1%, to $31.6 million. Investors
    should also keep in mind that thisdoesn'tinclude one of the biannual license payments Universal Display
    receives fromSamsung Displayin the second and fourth quarters of each year. Altogether in
    2016, Samsung Display's license payments will total $75
    million, up from $60 million in 2015.To that end, Universal Display generates revenue from two
    segments: royalty and license fees, which climbed 23% year over
    year last quarter, to $34.4 million (including $30 million from
    Samsung), and sales of OLED materials, which fell 1% year over
    year last quarter, to $27.8 million. Regarding the latter,
    Universal Display blamed year-end inventory management by
    customers, as well as its product mix weighing toward its
    lower-priced OLED emitters. In addition, note that there's a
    one-quarter lag in running royalties generated by sales of
    licensed products under Universal Display's long-term patent
    and license agreement withLG Display. Considering LG Display previously stated roughly 50% of its
    total OLED TV unit shipments in 2015 were sold in the fourth
    quarter alone -- and though LG Display's own manufacturing
    efforts for these high-end TVs is still in its early stages --
    we should see at least some positive impact from that agreement
    in Q1.I'll also be listening closely for color on new and expanded
    license agreements signed during the quarter, including a
    ""collaboration and evaluation agreement"" centering on OLED
    lighting with OSRAM signed in March. Givensimilaragreementssigned with the likes ofPhilipsand BOE in recent years, we shouldn't expect this to materially
    contribute to Universal Display's top or bottom lines in the
    near future. But given thevast potential for OLED lighting, which is cool to the touch, is highly energy efficient, and
    affords designers the ability to be made in flat, flexible form
    factors, it's encouraging to see an increasing number of
    suppliers demonstrating interest in the technology.In addition, listen for any hints from Universal Display
    management thatApplemight be expanding its use of OLED beyond ""just"" the
    displays in the Apple Watch -- namely, to its popular iPhone
    line. A few weeks ago, various South Korean news outlets
    reported that Samsung Display hassigned a deallasting at least three years to supply around 100 million OLED
    smartphone screens annually to Apple -- a massive development
    from which Universal Display would obviously benefit, even if
    it means further increasing its reliance on its largest
    customer in Samsung Display.At the same time, I don't expect Universal Display
    management to comment on the specific plans of Apple or Samsung
    Display. But I've been surprised before; After Universal
    Display's Q1 conference call almost exactly three years ago,
    for example, Inotedthat CEO Steve Abramson curiously pointed out that Apple had
    recently filed a patent for a wrist-worn OLED display,
    seemingly foreshadowing the Apple Watch. And late last year,
    Universal Display shares rose after Rosenblatt commented that,
    in his opinion, an OLED iPhone wasonly a matter of time.Until then, however, Universal Display investors will
    happily weather a few quarters of sluggish growth, especially
    if it means watching the massive growth story of Universal
    Display's flagship technology continue to unfold.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't

How Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Ride Facebook Inc (FB) to the Top;5/3/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) had a rough start with bots earlier this year when it released
  one into the wild thatTwitter Inc(TWTR) users quickly taught to become racist. But it's making up for
  it with some interesting tools that allow developers to create
  bots for all sorts of messaging apps including SMS.Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrmakeArticleAd();The most recent messaging app that Microsoft's Bot Framework
  supports isFacebook Inc's (FB) Messenger, and its 900 million monthly active users.Facebook bots made a big splash in April when FB unveiled itsMessenger Platform. The company sees it as a path toward monetizing Messenger by
  generating more organic interactions between businesses and users
  on the platform. MSFT is jumping on board, as it looks to even
  the disparity in apps between Windows and Android and iOS.MSFT Is Getting Millions of New Users Through
    FBOne of the first Microsoft bots is a Cortana bot the company
  made for Skype, which helps users identify the people and places
  in conversation. It can also add things to users' calendars and
  book travel accommodations.With the expansion of the Microsoft Bot Framework to FB
  Messenger, hundreds of millions of people suddenly have access to
  Microsoft's services.5 Stocks to Buy in No-Good, Stinkin' MayMoreover, Microsoft should be able to attract developers
  interested in creating Facebook bots since it's able to deploy a
  single bot across multiple platforms unlike Facebook's SDK. And
  that's good for Microsoft.Not only does Microsoft develop closer relationships with
  developers, it's able to acquire a portfolio of bots for its own
  messaging properties, Skype and Yammer - a part of Office
  365.Microsoft has been pushing to bring more engineers to its
  software development products with support for multiple
  platforms. It recently acquired Xamarin, which allows developers
  to create a core back-end codebase that's functional across iOS,
  Android, OS X and Windows. It bundled Xamarin's tools with its
  Visual Studio and offers them for free to individual
  developers.The biggest thing holding back Windows on mobile devices is
  its lack of apps relative to iOS and Android. Even the apps that
  it does have are often lacking compared to their iOS and Android
  counterparts.Creating bots, especially on a universal platform such as FB
  Messenger, could help bring the same level of functionality to
  Windows phones and tablets as iOS and Android devices.Your 2016 Retirement Spring Cleaning
      ChecklistMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella believesbots are the new apps. Instead of downloading a bunch of different apps for day-to-day
  activities, we'll have a few favorite apps, and interact with
  bots for the rest of the tasks we want to accomplish on our
  smartphones. Those bots can be on any one of many messaging apps,
  including plain-old text messaging.If bots really do become the new apps, solving everyday
  problems, Microsoft will have evened the software gap between
  itself and its competitors on mobile. At that point, hardware
  will become a more distinguishing feature, and Microsoft will
  have already made some big strides on that side of coin, given
  its recent release of the Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book.It certainly faces tough competition fromApple Inc.(AAPL),Samsung(SSNLF) and HTC, among others, but without software limitations holding
  it back, it'll be an easier road ahead for MSFT.That's why the company is working to expand bots to as many
  platforms as possible. With Facebook Messenger's 900 million
  monthly active users and a recent focus by the app itself on
  bots, Microsoft is striking while the iron's hot. IHowever, whether Mr. Nadella's sentiment that bots are the new
  apps is actually true remains to be seen.As of this writing, Adam Levy was long Apple. He does not

Why Analysts Disagree About Micron Technology Inc.;5/3/2016;"Image source: Micron Technology.Among analysts, there's isn't much agreement when it comes
    toMicron Technology. The memory-chip manufacturer has seen its revenue tumble and
    its profits disappear as oversupply in the DRAM and NAND
    markets drove per-bit prices down. The stock has slumped along
    with the company's results, losing nearly two-thirds of its
    value over the past year, and wiping out much of the gains
    investors enjoyed in 2013 and 2014.makeArticleAd();MUdata byYChartsAnalyst price targets for Micron stock range from as low as
    $8 to as high as $20, a spread that's wider than the current
    stock price of about $10.50. Why is there so much
    disagreement?The major differenceA couple of recent upgrades for Micron came from Raymond
    James and Brean Capital, along with price targets of $17
    and $14, respectively. On the other side, Nomura and
    Susquehanna downgraded Micron in March. Nomura dropped its
    price target to just $8 per share, while Susquehanna dropped
    its target to $10.Despite the wide gap in price targets, there's really only
    one difference between the bullish analysts and the bearish
    analysts. The bullish analysts believe that the DRAM industry
    has fundamentally changed because of consolidation. There are
    now only three major DRAM manufacturers, and the idea is that
    these companies will attempt to maximize profits instead of
    gunning for market share. Supply-driven cycles may still occur,
    but they won't be as severe compared to the past.Micron posted a $1 billion net loss in fiscal 2012, with
    prices dragged down by oversupply. This situation eventually
    corrected itself, and in fiscal 2014 Micron earned a whopping
    $3 billion in net profit. The stock soared, trading at a
    price-to-book ratio of about 3.5, a level not seen since the
    aftermath of the dot-com bubble. Investors were betting that
    the good times would never end.But even with only three competitors, high margins didn't
    last. Micron's profits eventually began to tumble, and during
    the latest quarter, the company posted a net loss once again.
    The bearish analysts believe that nothing has really changed in
    the industry, and Micron's posting a loss seems to bear that
    out, at least to a degree.Samsung, one of the major DRAM manufacturers, never got the memo about
    maximizing profits. The company has been aggressively going
    after market share, so much so that Bernstein analyst Mark
    Newman, once extremely bullish on the stock, proclaimed that
    Samsung has ruined for the industry what could have been a
    period of record profits. Bernstein had a mesmerizing $45 price
    target on the stock as recently as June 2015. The firm has
    since lowered that target multiple times to just $10 per
    share.Micron isn't cutting its production either, despite rapidly
    falling prices. During the company's conference call, when
    asked whether it was planning on cutting output, CEO Mark
    Durcan responded: ""Well, first of all, we're not going to do it
    unless we see negative cash margins, because we haven't added
    any incremental capacity. And we think we'd be foolish to be
    the first ones to take capacity off, given that fact set.""Combine Samsung's aggressiveness, Micron's unwillingness to
    cut production, continued weak demand for PCs, and the first
    quarterly decline in global smartphone shipments, and you have
    the makings of a deep slump in the memory-chip market.The bullish analysts still believe that the effects of
    consolidation will ultimately win out, but nearly everything is
    pointing in the opposite direction. So far, I don't see any
    evidence at all that the industry has fundamentally
    changed.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

2 Beaten Down Apple Inc. Suppliers to Buy in May;5/3/2016;"Image credit: Apple.Technology stocks have a reputation for being volatile, no
    doubt due to the incredibly dynamic nature of the technology
    industry in general. However, the same fundamental rules that
    apply to non-technology stocks applies to technology stocks:
    buying and holding high-quality businesses for the long-term is
    often a great way to build wealth.makeArticleAd();In this column, I'd like to talk about two beaten down tech
    stocks -- suppliers toApple, in fact -- that have solid long-term prospects and that
    tech investors should consider buying:Synaptics, andSkyworks Solutions.Synaptics' woes seem temporarySynaptics develops what are called ""human interface solutions""
    -- in other words, the technologies implemented in modern
    computers to allow people to interact with them. Examples
    include touch controllers for smartphones/tablets, PC touchpad
    controllers, pressure sensors technology for mobile devices
    (aka 3D Touch), display driver chips, and more.The stock recently tumbled from north of $85 per share to
    under $70 per share as a result of a significant revenue miss
    in its recent quarter and very ugly forward guidance ($300-$340
    million against consensus estimates of $478.6 million).The miss, according to CEO Rick Bergman, is attributable to
    a ""precipitous drop in order levels within the smartphone
    market, specifically around our display driver customer."" In
    addition to weakness in premium smartphones, PC-related revenue
    also came under pressure as a result of the continued weakness
    in the PC market overall.Bergman also noted that the company is taking a ""cautious
    approach"" to setting its guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter
    ""in anticipation that the level of product currently in the
    supply chain will be sufficient to meet the reduced demand for
    our display driver products from high-end smartphone OEMs.""Although the picture looks pretty grim in the near-term,
    there's a solid chance that things could rebound in the second
    half of the calendar year. Apple's upcoming iPhone
    7-series launch could help, particularly on the display driver
    side of things, and management has indicated that it has
    secured many wins for its finger-print sensors as well as its
    ClearForce technology (Apple 3D Touch clone).In my view, Synaptics is a company that executes very well
    on technology but is currently facing a slump due to factors
    largely outside its control. If those factors subside, I expect
    Synaptics' financials, and ultimately its stock, to sharply
    rebound.As a result, Synaptics could be a very interesting buy here
    for the patient tech investor.Skyworks: revenue growth even if iPhone units don'tSkyworks is a well-known supplier of Radio Frequency, or RF,
    chips into the smartphone market, as well as into other
    applications.The very interesting thing about being an RF chip player is
    that each year, the complexity of the RF technology required in
    smartphones goes up.""Among our top customers, we see complexity and increasing
    performance requirements driving content expansion across the
    board,"" said Skyworks CEO David Aldrich on a recent conference
    call with analysts.""For example, our overall content onSamsung's flagship Galaxy S7 platform is up 20% versus prior models,""
    Aldrich added. He also pointed to a 40% increase in content
    within Huawei's ""new flagship smartphone platforms.""The upshot of this continued surge in RF content inside of
    smartphones is that even in an environment in which units
    aren't growing, Skyworks can still see total revenue growth.
    There's little doubt that this increase in content/complexity
    is helping to fuel the company's gross profit margin growth,
    which Aldrich said came in at up 410 basis points (i.e. 4.1%)
    year-over-year.As of a recent check, Skyworks trades at $67.12 per share,
    down substantially from its 52-week high of $112.88. On a
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles basis, Skyworks
    delivered $4.91 per share in earnings, and I believe over the
    long-term this can continue to grow.I think at current levels, Skyworks shares look compelling
    and could be a very interesting way to play a potential
    recovery in the smartphone market (especially iPhone),
    particularly since it can grow revenue fairly independently of
    industry unit growth through content growth.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple Inc. May Be Losing Smartphone Share to Samsung;5/2/2016;"Image credit: Apple.DescribingApple's most recent quarterly financial results as ""disappointing""
    might just be an understatement -- they were downright ugly.
    Apple reported a sharp decline in iPhone unit shipments in its
    most recent quarter and, as a result of weak demand and a
    commensurate channel inventory adjustment, iPhone units are
    expected to drop significantly again in the current
    quarter.makeArticleAd();Although CEO Tim Cook blamed the iPhone declines on a
    weaker-than-hoped upgrade cycle relative to that seen following
    the iPhone 6/6 Plus launch as well as broader macroeconomic
    weakness. Cook pointed to high customer loyalty and record
    levels of Android switchers to iPhone as positives that bode
    well for the company's iPhone business over the long term.That being said, I can't help but note that Apple may be
    losing share to Samsung. Allow me to explain.Look at the year-over-year comparisonsApple reported a drop in iPhone sales from around 61 million to
    around 51 million in the most recent quarter, a reduction of
    approximately 16%. In contrast,Samsungreported that sales in its ""Mobile"" group (smartphones,
    tablets, etc.) were actually up 8% year-over-year in its most
    recent quarter.For all of 2016, Samsung aims to see a year-over-year
    increase in the profitability of its mobile division ""through
    high-end sales growth and solid profitability of mid to low-end
    products.""Apple, in contrast, will have seen iPhone sales flat in
    fiscal Q1, iPhone down in fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3, with its
    fiscal Q4 something of an unknown at this point, though analyst
    consensus calls for a 9.1% year-over-year drop in total
    revenue, implying further iPhone unit declines.It's clear that Samsung is seeing better year-over-year
    growth than Apple is.Is it share gain against Apple, or ...?One potential explanation is that Samsung is simply regaining
    share in the premium tier of the smartphone market, which Apple
    dominates, from Apple. In fact, given that the Galaxy S7 seems
    to have been fairly well received and is superior to the
    current iPhone 6s flagship in a number of key ways (display
    quality, camera, and weight), this wouldn't be too
    surprising.However, it's important to note that Apple isn't theonlyplayer in the premium tier of the smartphone market (though it
    is the largest). Samsung may very well be gaining share against
    other vendors of Android-based smartphones (i.e. HTC, LG, and
    so on), which could explain the South Korean consumer
    electronics giant's year-over-year growth in mobile.Apple is probably losing share; iPhone 7 needs to be a
    hitAlthough I doubt that Apple would ever admit it, it seems
    likely that part of the iDevice maker's iPhone woes is due to
    share loss in the premium tier of the market to the likes of
    Samsung, Huawei, and others.Fortunately, I think that with a strong iPhone 7 showing
    later this year, Apple has an opportunity to grow its share in
    the premium portion of the smartphone market. Apple will need
    to make sure that the iPhone 7 is sufficiently
    advanced/compelling, though, to stay relevant once the Android
    vendors launch their flagships in the middle of the iPhone 7
    cycle.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

through a checklist.Once up and running, the actual virtual reality experience is
slick. The resolution is higher than in the past, but still low
enough that there is some granularity - although lag has been all
but eliminated and the refresh rate is fast enough that motion
sickness should be less of an issue.The single camera limits the wearer's virtual movements to
several steps, but developers have released some titles that really
take advantage of this VR gear. Video games in particular are
entertaining with titles likeChronosandLucky's Taleleading the charge.However, good as the experience is, having to use an Xbox
controller instead of the Oculus Touch (which isn't released until
later this year) is a compromise and most titles still feel like
experimental adaptations from standard game titles. You can see the
future of gaming with the Oculus Rift, but we're clearly in early
days.But the Cost…As cool as the VR world created by the Oculus headset may be,
the money required to make the most of it will bring many people
crashing back to reality.The first obstacle is the price of the Oculus Rift itself: $599.
That's a lot more than the$350 Oculus hinted at before release, causing a serious PR problem prior to launch. However, the
headset is just the start for many potential buyers.Powering the pixels behind that virtual reality requires some
serious computing muscle. If your PC isn't up to the task -and for
many people it won't be - then PC manufacturers like Dell are
selling ""Oculus Ready"" computer bundles starting at $1,500.Then there are the specialized Touch controllers expected to be
released later this year.All told, the equipment required for the full Oculus Rift VR
experience could end up costing well over $2,000.When you compare that to the cost ofMicrosoft Corporation's (MSFT) Xbox One at $350 for the console, a controller and a pre-pack
game or two, the case gets harder to make for buying into Oculus -
at least for most consumers.Key SpecificationsSource: Oculus VRTwo 1200 x 1080-pixel OLED displays110 degree field of visionCamera tracks area 5 feet x 11 feetAccelerometerGyroscopeRemovable headphonesBuilt-in micRequires a Windows PC with minimum Core i5-4590 CPU

mainstream in 2016. The HTC Vive andSony Corp (ADR)'s (SNE) Playstation VR are just two of the high profile releases, but the
spotlight is firmly on the Oculus Rift.The FB acquisition delivers a compelling VR experience, although
it's pretty obvious that we're in the first generation of this
technology. But Oculus boasts a solid collection of launch titles,
and developers are excited about the platform.5 Key Battlefronts in the Battle Between Google
    and SamsungParent company Facebook is pumped about introducing virtual
reality to social media, and that's going to help push
adoption.For now, though, the primary drawback of the Oculus Rift is its
steep entry price. If it was the cost equivalent of a gaming
console, mass adoption could be in the cards. But at $599 (or over
$2k if your PC isn't up to snuff), making the leap into the VR
world of Oculus is too expensive for anyone but early adopters and
hardcore VR enthusiasts.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a

This Chinese Company Thinks It Can Dethrone Apple's iPhone In Just 3 Years;5/1/2016;"The Huawei Watch, may be the company's most recognizable
      product among American consumers. Source: HuaweiChinese handset giant Huawei has bold ambitions: the firm
    hopes to sell more smartphones thanAppleby 2019. And it's well on its way. The firm was the
    third-largest seller of smartphones last quarter, according to
    research firmIDC, shipping 27.5 million handsets on a global basis. Apple
    shipped nearly twice as many, but Huawei's growth was far more
    impressive, and the company is slowly closing the gap. As
    Huawei expands into additional markets, particularly the U.S.,
    it could provide some tough competition in the years ahead.makeArticleAd();Aiming for No. 1In an interview back in February, Huawei's CEO Richard Yu toldCNBCthat the company wanted to be the second-largest smartphone
    vendor in the world within three years. Even more ambitious, by
    2021, it hoped to be the largest. To do so, it would have to
    leapfrog both Apple andSamsung, which have consistently held the top slots for the last
    several years. In the first quarter of 2016, Samsung shipped
    nearly 82 million handsets, while Apple shipped just
    over 51 million.Source:IDC.Huawei came in a relatively distant third. But unlike Apple
    and Samsung, it experienced strong growth on an annual basis,
    with shipments rising 58.4% from the first quarter of 2015.
    Both Apple and Samsung, in contrast, saw their smartphone
    shipments fall on a year-over-year basis. Notably, Apple saw
    its shipments decline 16.3%.Huawei courts Chinese and European consumers with
    affordable Android handsetsHuawei's recent success has been fueled by its smartphone
    strategy: The company offers powerful Android handsets at
    affordable prices. Most Americans
    aren't familiar with the company or its products, but
    Huawei's flagships often sport impressive hardware and
    innovative features (like its Mate S was the first Android
    phone to offerpressure-sensitive featureson par with Apple's 3D Touch technology) that make them
    attractive to consumers in other markets. Meanwhile, its budget
    phones are sold at rock-bottom prices, but boast more than
    adequate internals.Huawei's Honor 7 is a typical phone for the company. It
    retails for around $400, and packs a 5.2-inch display, speedy
    processor, fingerprint scanner, and 20-megapixel camera within
    its metal frame.The combination of high-end specs at inexpensive prices has
    allowed Huawei to dominate the Chinese smartphone market. In
    the third quarter last year, Huawei overtook Chinese rival
    Xiaomi as the top seller of smartphones in the Middle Kingdom.
    But Huawei's success hasn't been limited to its home market.
    Also in the third quarter of 2015, Huawei emerged as the
    second-largest seller of Android smartphones in Europe behind
    only Samsung, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel.Major challenges lay ahead for HuaweiTo achieve its targets, Huawei has been expanding into new
    markets: Earlier this year, it began selling some of its
    products to American buyersthroughAmazon.com.But Huawei still faces significant challenges. In 2012,
    Congress labeled the company a threat to U.S. national
    security. A report from the House Intelligence Committee said
    the company, which also sells telecommunications equipment, was
    working as a spy for the Chinese government. That decree didn't
    cover Huawei's handsets, but the allegations could damage
    Huawei in its attempts to win the trust of American buyers.Moreover, the Android market is highly competitive, and
    Huawei could find itself pressured by one of many other
    fast-rising vendors. Last quarter, Chinese firms OPPO and vivo
    emerged as the fourth- and fifth-largest sellers of smartphones
    globally, up from relative obscurity. Huawei itself emerged
    from almost nowhere in recent years to take the third spot,
    displacing Xiaomi (once seen as a major threat to Apple and
    Samsung) in the process.Still, with its 8.2% global market share, Huawei has emerged
    as the definite third player in the smartphone market. It
    remains to be seen if the company can actually overtake Apple
    or Samsung, but it's certainly going to try.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Comcast to Export Xfinity onto Roku and Samsung Hardware;4/29/2016;"The future of TV is app-based. Source: AppleThanks to anAlphabet-led lobbying effort, the U.S. cable industry is in a
    state of upheaval.In February, the Federal Communications Commission
    approved a proposal to ""unlock the box."" If fully enacted, the FCC's new regulations would almost
    assuredly pressure the long-standing industry practice of
    renting cable boxes to consumers.makeArticleAd();However, in an apparent effort to prove the industry can
    indeed innovate without government intervention, several cable
    companies have announcednew productsin recent weeks. In the latest example of this move, cable
    giantComcastmade public plans to overhaul its Xfinity service.Opening the door ... for someLast week, a number of reports claimed Comcast had signed deals
    with Korean electronics giantSamsungand streaming device makerRoku. As part of the deal, Comcast will create a standalone
    Xfinity-branded app for Samsung's smart TVs and Roku's
    hardwareIn addition to allowing DVR access, Comcast's new app will
    allow its cable subscribers to stream live and on-demand
    content through their Rokus and Samsung smart TVs. According to
    Comcast CTO Mark Hess, ""We remain committed to giving our
    customers more choice in how, when and where they access their
    subscription, and the Xfinity TV Partner Program enables us to
    efficiently and effectively expand the range of devices our
    customers can utilize to do that.""In addition to the Samsung and Roku deals, Comcast also
    announced it plans to create a third-party integration program
    to bring its services to other hardware producers. Though
    certainly a positive step toward providing consumers greater
    flexibility in accessing their services, Comcast isn't offering
    its customers a chance to escape their cable boxes altogether.
    Users will need at least one Comcast cable box on premises in
    order to access the new online apps. All told, these efforts,
    while seemingly consumer-friendly, are more self-serving for
    Comcast than anything else.Under pressureThe timing of Comcast's move could hardly be less subtle -- not
    that the cable giant appears concerned about appearances. In
    addition to announcing the Samsung and Roku partnerships,
    Comcast also published a lengthy blog post decrying the FCC's
    attempts to deregulate the set-top box market.Comcast and other cable providers likeTime Warner Cable,Verizon Communications, andAT&Tall staunchly oppose the FCC's efforts to standardize
    cable box technology. Doing so would allow third-party hardware
    manufacturers to sell devices compatible with virtually any
    cable service. And the long-standing industry requirement that
    cable subscribers purchase or rent their cable boxes from their
    cable provider has been a cash cow for those companies.The FCC estimates 99% of Americans rent their cable boxes
    from their providers. With an average cost of $231 a year, box
    rental fees produce revenues of over $20 billion for U.S. cable
    companies. Further, cable box rental fees have increased an
    estimated 185% since 1994, compared to a 90% decline in the
    cost of similar consumer electronics hardware. As it did years
    ago with the landline phone industry, the FCC is now moving to
    break this longtime industry norm, on the theory that greater
    competition will reduce costs and spur innovation.Source: AlphabetTech industry companies clearly view this as a major
    opportunity, which helps explain Alphabet's active lobbying
    role throughout the FCC's review and debate process. 
    Allowing companies with deep expertise in software, likeAppleand Alphabet, to develop their own cable-enabled boxes would
    provide them with a new potential hub and entry point for their
    budding smart home services.The threat that tech firms might start siphoning away its
    set-top box revenues has predictably spurred the cable industry
    into action. In addition to Comcast's efforts, Verizon
    announced plans to overhaul its FiOS cable service to provide
    greater access to third-party offerings likeNetflixandAmazon's streaming service. The cable providers hope that by
    demonstrating their willingness to evolve their services
    without the need for deregulation, they can avoid stronger
    governmental intervention. So expect to see more product
    announcements -- and more rhetoric -- from them in the coming
    weeks.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Is Now the Time to Buy InvenSense, Inc.?;4/29/2016;"Remember the summer of 2014 when shares of Internet of
    Things chipmakerInvenSensewere over $25 per share? Fast-forward to today, and you'll find
    shares trading around a paltry $8. Surely a bargain is to be
    had, right? Let's dig in and take a look.First, a little background on the company's decline. When
    wearable technology and other Internet of Things tech first hit
    the market, the sky seemed to be the limit for InvenSense. The
    company had the market cornered on smartwatch motion sensors
    and was a major chip supplier forAppleandSamsungsmartphones as well. But competition heated up and makers of
    wearables started to diversify. Sales growth and earnings at
    InvenSense started to come in below expectations, and as that
    reality set in, shares took a tumble.makeArticleAd();INVNdata byYChartsOther than a share price that has recently plumbed all-time
    lows, the picture for the chipmaker could be a lot worse. Sales
    have continued to climb, and while earnings have gotten
    volatile as of late, the company is still profitable on an
    annualized basis.As far as outlook goes, you would be hard-pressed to find
    any positive news. The company's management has issued soft
    guidance as smartphone purchases worldwide start to slow, and
    competition among chipmakers for the existing market of IoT
    devices is fierce. Analysts see FY17 revenue dropping by almost
    4% and earnings dropping by over 6%. Investors will no doubt be
    waiting to see where management guides financials for the new
    fiscal year, and whether that guidance exceeds the current
    downbeat feelings on the Street. InvenSense is scheduled to
    report Q4 earnings on May 9.To shop or not to shopWith share prices wallowing on all the negative PR, should
    investors call a bottom here and buy in? Let's look at a few
    valuation metrics and compare them with those of InvenSense's
    industry.MetricInvenSenseIntegrated Circuits IndustryPrice to sales (trailing 12 months)1.71.8Price to earnings (trailing 12 months)345.427.1Forward price to earnings17.513.6Five-year expected growth rate (per year)18.3%14.6%Five-year PEG ratio0.950.91Chart data source: Yahoo! Finance.The math demonstrates the rough 12-month period InvenSense
    has had. Price to sales, a measure of stock price to total
    revenue, has dropped below the industry average as a result of
    the stock drop, and price to earnings is ugly, as company
    profit has dropped more steeply than share prices. The picture
    going forward looks a little more optimistic, though. Forward
    price to earnings cleans up and is only a little higher than
    the industry average, and five-year earnings growth estimates
    exceed the industry. As a result, the PEG ratio, which measures
    the premium paid for future growth outlook, is in line with
    peers.These figures indicate to me that InvenSense is currently
    fairly valued, but these numbers could change after we get
    guidance from the company during the earnings release on May 9.
    Ignoring short-term thinking and expectations, however, the
    company is expected to outperform as far as growth in the years
    to come.Company management plans to execute its growth strategy by
    diversifying away from smartphones. The company has invested so
    that its technology now has applications for wearable tech such
    as watches and cameras, drones, and automobiles. New sensory
    technology has also been developed for microphone applications,
    environment detection, and fingerprint reading. InvenSense
    hopes these investments will help diversify the business, not
    just across various technology applications, but also by
    geographical and end-client sales.InvenSense demonstrates its motion sensing technology. Image
    credit: InvenSense.The fruits of this labor are starting to be seen. The
    company recently announced a new deal for use of one of its
    microphones with Gionee, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer. The
    company has also rolled out six new video and audio systems for
    use across multiple applications, as well as the company's
    first software service, Coursa Retail, since the first of the
    year.Could there be more drop left in InvenSense's stock? Sure,
    but that depends on any forward outlook changes in coming
    months. Is the stock a value? It looks to me like it's
    approaching that point if it isn't already, especially when
    considering the five-year growth potential. For those willing
    to be patient, I think it's worth the wait as the company
    diversifies its product mix and rides the growing IoT wave.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

AAPL Stock: ABYSMAL Apple Inc. Earnings Put Focus on iPhone 7;4/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) hasn't been in a situation like this in a long time. After
breaking out its fiscal second-quarter numbers yesterday, the truth
is staring investors in the face: Apple is a company in decline.
Wall Street didn't hesitate to react, and AAPL stock plunged on the
news.Source:iphonedigital via FlickrShares are down more than 8% in morning trading.makeArticleAd();For the first time since 2003, Apple posted a
quarter-over-quarter revenue decline. It failed to meet both
revenue and earnings expectations. iPhone sales, AAPL stock's core
driver for nearly a decade, fell for the first time ever, and
guidance for fiscal Q3 (the current quarter) was also
horrendous.The Enormous Pressure on AAPL StockEvery time AAPL earnings come out, the company tries to
write a really impressive headline above a synopsis of its results.
Last quarter it was ""iPhone, Apple Watch, Services & Apple TV
Drive All-time Record Revenue."" What the headline didn't say was
that revenue was up just 2% year-over-year.This time, there was no record revenue to tout. The headline
ominously madeno mentionof growth of any sort: ""Capital Return Program Expanding to $250
Billion.""Your 2016 Retirement Spring Cleaning
    ChecklistI'm sure Carl Icahn will be elated the AAPL stock buyback
program increased from $140 billion to $175 billion, and the
quarterly dividend is going up 10%, from 52 cents to 57 cents.But to focus on that is to ignore the elephant in the room:The iPhone is faltering.Q2 revenue fell 13% to $50.56 billion, missing the $51.97
billion analysts called for. AAPL earnings per share of $1.90 also
missed the $2 consensus pretty handily … and then there was the
guidance.Oh, the guidance!Apple forecast fiscal third-quarter revenue between $41 billion
and $43 billion, which was miles away from the consensus Street
figure of $47.4 billion. This was where AAPL stock really did
itself in: That's a crushing miss, and at the midpoint of $42
billion, suggests a year-over-year revenue decline of 15%.The takeaway for Apple stock owners? The iPhone 7, when it
comes out later this year (likely September), better be
mind-numbingly awesome. It needs to blow away the competition fromSamsung(SSNLF), it needs to convert consumers usingAlphabet Inc's (GOOG,GOOGL) Android phones … and it needs to sell like crazy.Demand for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s is obviously drying up,
and optimists will point out that there are likely millions of
people out there waiting for the latest and greatest from Apple
this fall; the pent-up demand, they argue, will drive AAPL stock
higher later this year as consumers gobble up the iPhone 7 this
holiday season.But personally, I thought the surprise release of the 4-inch
iPhone SE in March - Apple's first 4-inch smartphone since 2013 -
would also suck up a meaningful amount of latent demand from people
not so enamored with massive screens that make typing awkward.Given AAPL's results yesterday - and its projections for the
current quarter - that wasn't the case.AAPL Stock: ""Iteration"" Finally Chokes Apple
    Inc.Unless Tim Cook magically becomes a creative genius and drops a
groundbreaking Jobs-esque new product line on us later this year,
AAPL stock's only hope of revival is the iPhone 7. Even then,
there's no guarantee it'll fly off the shelves.Apple is cash-rich, sure. But unless the iPhone 7 can put up
some big growth numbers, Apple shares probably won't makeyoucash rich.As of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in

"Apple (AAPL) Stock Falls on Weak Q2 Earnings; Q3 View Soft";4/27/2016;"Apple Inc.AAPLposted lower-than-expected results for both earnings and revenues
in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Additionally, the tech
bellwether provided a soft outlook for the third quarter
considering continued macroeconomic headwinds and demand woes. This
resulted in a decline of nearly 8% in Apple shares in the
after-hours trading session yesterday.Earnings of $1.90 per share not only declined 18.5% year over
year, but also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97.
Revenues of $50.6 billion were also below the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of $51.5 billion and down approximately 12.8% from the
year-ago quarter.The business was impacted by soft demand for iPhones, the
primary revenue generator for Apple. In addition, weakness in
high-growth regions like China also acted as a speed-breaker for
the company. Another thing to note is that the company faced
difficult year-over-year comparison. Results in the year-ago
quarter had benefitted from pent-up demand that was met by iPhone
6.Product DetailsApple iPhone unit sales came in at about 51.2 million, down 16%
year over year. Revenues from iPhone also fell 18% from the
year-ago quarter to $32.9 billion (65% of the total revenue).Nearly 10.3 million units of iPad were sold in the quarter,
generating revenues of $4.4 billion. However, unit sales and
revenues each declined 19% on a year-over-year basis.Though Apple Mac has been gaining market share despite the
continued slump in the PC market, both its unit sales and revenues
came in lower than the last year quarter. While unit sales declined
12% year over year to over 4 million, revenues dropped to $5.1
billion, down 9% from the prior-year quarter.Services, which include revenues from the Internet Services,
AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 20% year
over year to nearly $6 billion.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple
Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party
accessories, rose 30% year over year to over $2.2 billion. However,
the segment revenues declined nearly 50% sequentially.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products remained soft across most of the
geographical regions. As much as 67% of sales were from the
International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of
$19.1 billion in the quarter, down 10% year over year.Europe generated nearly $11.5 billion in revenues, down 5% on a
year-over-year basis.Owing to macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around
26% year over year in the Greater China region to $12.5
billion.Japan was the only market for Apple this quarter that registered
year-over-year growth in sales. Revenues of $4.3 billion rose 24%
over the prior-year quarter.In the rest of Asia Pacific, the company reported revenues of
$3.2 billion, down 25% year over year.MarginsGross margin was 39.4%, a decline of 140 basis points (bps) from
the year-ago quarter.  Lower average selling price of Apple
devices (especially iPhone) was one of the key reasons for the
reduced margins.Operating expenses increased 10.3% year over year to $5.9
billion due to higher research & development expenses. As a
result, operating margin plunged 850 bps from the year-ago quarter
to 27.7%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable
securities) were $55.3 billion at the end of the quarter, compared
with $41.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. Long-term debt was
$69.4 billion compared with $53.5 billion at the end of fiscal
2015.Other Financial UpdatesFor the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was
$11.6 billion. Apple returned about $10 billion in capital returns
this quarter though dividends and share repurchases.Apple also expanded its capital return program by $50 billion.
This brings the total to $250 billion valid through Mar 2018.The company also increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 57
cents per share. The increased dividend will be payable on May 12
to shareholders of record as on May 9.GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple forecasts revenues
in the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. The Zacks Consensus
Estimate for the same is pegged higher at $45.6 billion.Gross margin is expected within 37.5% to 38%, while operating
expenses are projected within $6 billion to $6.1 billion. Other
income/(expense) is likely to be $300 million, while tax rate is
expected to be 25.5%.Our TakeThe company is likely to be impacted by near-term macroeconomic
headwinds as is evident from the soft guidance for the ongoing
quarter. This is the first time in years that Apple has seen a
decline in iPhone shipments and even lower prices for its devices.
A prime reason for this is stiff competition from the likes of
SamsungSSNLFand LenovoLNVGY, along with the sluggish demand for iPhone 6s. In addition, the
company will still have to find a way around the market saturation
in the U.S. and some other important regions in order to keep
itself on the growth trajectory.The company can get some respite after it launches iPhone 7 in
the back half of this year.  Meanwhile, Apple is aiming to tap
a greater share of the market with its budget offering iPhone SE.
The company seems especially optimistic about emerging nations like
India where the scope for growth is high.Apple's services business is also expected to remain strong as
it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices and
the company does have a loyal customer base. Also, in the long run,
Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position,
strength in technology and the ecosystem (Apple Watch and Apple
Pay) that it has built. Further, its enterprise collaborations with
the likes of IBM Corp.IBMare expected to be important growth drivers.Currently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is Qualcomm Inc. Stock a Buy After Earnings Beat?;4/27/2016;"Shares ofQualcommheld steady after the mobile chipmaker beat second-quarter
    earnings estimates on both the top and bottom lines last week.
    Non-GAAP revenue fell 20% annually to $5.54 billion, but beat
    expectations by $200 million. Net income fell 34% to $1.6
    billion, while diluted earnings (boosted by buybacks) fell 26%
    to $1.04 per share -- which still exceeded estimates $0.08.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Chipmaking (QCT) revenue fell 19% to $3.34 billion, as the
    unit's operating profit plunged 77% to $170 million. That
    decline was mainly attributed to slowing sales of smartphones,
    the loss of market share to rivals likeMediaTek, and OEMs likeSamsungandHuaweiproducing their own mobile chips.Licensing (QTL) revenue declined 12% to $2.14 billion as
    operating profit fell 14% to $1.86 billion. That decline was
    caused by lower licensing fees in China caused by underreported
    shipments. Let's dig beyond those numbers to understand the
    positive and negative aspects of Qualcomm's report, and whether
    investors should buy shares.First, the good newsThe first piece of good news is that Qualcomm has dealt with
    its licensing disputes in a timely manner. It announced that
    its royalty dispute withLG, which was revealed during the first-quarter earnings call,
    was settled for an undisclosed amount. It also continued
    securing new patent licensing deals with Chinese OEMs likeXiaomi,Lenovo, andHiSense. These moves might prevent its QTL losses from accelerating,
    but investors should note that other licensing disputes with
    South Korean, Taiwanese, and European regulatorsremain unresolved. However, Qualcomm declared during its conference call that
    QTL revenues could rise to ""greater than $10 billion"" in fiscal
    2020 -- up from a range between  $7.3 billion and $8
    billion this year.MSM (mobile station modem) chip shipments fell 19% annually
    to 189 million, but that figure was closer to the high end of
    its previous guidance for 175 million to 195 million shipments,
    thanks to shipments of the Snapdragon 820 for Samsung's Galaxy
    S7. Qualcomm expects the same 175 million to 195 million
    shipments for the current quarter, which would represent a 13%
    to 22% annual decline. Those figures leave much to be desired,
    but they indicate that sales of new Snapdragon chips will
    likely prevent QCT revenue from falling off a cliff this
    year.Now, the bad newsThe bad news is that total 3G/4G device sales, which already
    fell 8% annually to $70.1 billion, are expected to keep
    falling. Device sales for the current quarter are expected to
    fall 1% to 14% annually. For the full year, Qualcomm lowered
    its device shipment forecast from a 1.67-1.77 billion range to
    1.625-1.725 billion -- which would represent a range between an
    11% annual decline and 5% growth.Those figures are slightly belowGartner's estimate that global smartphone sales will only rise 7% this
    year, compared to 14% growth in 2015. Competition from cheaper
    rivals and first-party chip solutions will make it even tougher
    for Qualcomm to keep pace with the overall market. To offset
    that slowdown, Qualcomm is relying on new SoCs for Internet of
    Things devices, connected cameras, connected cars, and drones
    to diversify its portfolio away from smartphones and tablets.
    That move, which is supported by its $2.4 billion acquisition
    of CSR, could crush smaller camera and drone chipmakerslikeAmbarella.Qualcomm's Snapdragon Flight drone reference design. Image
    source: Qualcomm.The fundamentalsI believe that three things will set a floor under Qualcomm at
    current prices -- its buybacks, dividends, and valuation.
    During the quarter, Qualcomm spent $1.5 billion to buy back
    shares at an average price of $49 per share. That was a
    refreshing change of pace fromoverpaying for its own sharesin previous quarters, and indicates that it's willing to defend
    the $50 level with buybacks.It also spent $700 million on dividends, and boosted its
    payout by 10% in March -- representing its 13th consecutive
    year of dividend increases. That translates to a forward annual
    yield of 4%, which is significantly higher thanIntel's forward yield of 3.3%. Analysts expect Qualcomm to grow its
    annual earnings by 11% over the next five years, which gives it
    a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.1. This indicates that Qualcomm is
    cheaper relative to its earnings growth potential than Intel,
    which has a higher 5-year PEG ratio of 1.3.So is Qualcomm stock a buy?Investors looking for rapid price growth should avoid Qualcomm,
    since its QTL and QCT troubles won't likely clear up anytime
    soon. However, investors looking for a stable income stock
    supported by a 4% yield and a strong track record of buybacks
    should take a closer look at the beaten-down chipmaker.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't

Western Digital Corp (WDC) Stock Is a Solid Long-Term Value Play;4/26/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsWestern Digital Corp(WDC) has been on the slide for about a month now, not long after it
  got the green light for its planned acquisition ofSanDisk Corporation(SNDK), which had been in the works since October of last
  year.makeArticleAd();Originally, the deal was expected to cost WDC an estimated $19
  billion, but that figure was reduced to $17 billion after the
  withdrawal ofUnisplendour, a Chinese electronics manufacturer, which had previouslyagreed to acquire a 15% stake in WDCvalued at nearly $4 billion.Still, both Western Digital and SanDisk, as well as WDC and
  SNDK shareholders, stand to benefit immensely in the long
  run.Benefits for Western DigitalWDC has long been a leader in the hard drive industry,
  battling for market dominance against its closest competitorSeagate Technology PLC(STX). Both companies have struggled with declining revenue in the
  face of a massive paradigm shift away from traditional hard
  drives to solid-state drives and flash memory storage.Your 2016 Retirement Spring Cleaning
      ChecklistMerging with SanDisk will allow WDC to benefit from SNDK's
  position as a top player in the SSD and flash memory storage
  arena. Synergy of both products and revenues will help Western
  Digital advance its position in enterprise markets with a new
  product portfolio that is broader and more comprehensive than
  ever before.Access to SanDisk's current product lineup, as well as its
  chip manufacturing facilities and foundries, will allow Western
  Digital toreduce operating expenses by more than $180
  millionover the next year-and-a-half by shedding redundant products and
  eliminating poorer-performing facilities.Benefits for SanDiskFor the past year, SNDK has struggled to gain momentum. Shares
  of SanDisk stock were caught in a clear downtrend, off 50% in a
  year, before Western Digital swooped in.Battling tech benehothsSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) andMicron Technology, Inc.(MU) for dominance in the flash memory arena, SanDisk hasn't fared
  too well. Much of that is due to steadily declining prices of
  solid-state drives, a trend that's expected to continue for at
  least the next few years.Merging with Western Digital gives SanDisk access to more
  significant resources that can be used to stave off the
  competitiion and reduce overall SSD production costs. Lower
  manufacturing costs would translate into easier sales and
  increased OEM contracts for SanDisk SSDs in consumer laptops.Bottom Line for Western Digital and SanDisk MergerWDC management believes that merging with SanDisk will
  ultimately result in cost synergies of more than $1 billion by
  the year 2020. Assuming that SNDK continues to manufacture
  top-quality cutting-edge SSD and flash memory products, competing
  against the likes of Micron and Samsung should be a much easier
  prospect.Plus, despite decreasing demand for traditional hard drives in
  the U.S. and Europe, the technological capabilities of emerging
  markets around the world should keep Western Digital humming
  along like a well-oiled machine.The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy
      Right NowGranted, none of this will show up this week when Western
  Digital reports earnings (for the record, WDC will post its
  numbers Thursday after the bell).But the merger between Western Digital and SanDisk makes WDC
  stock a great long-term value play - especially considering that

Why TSMC Is Likely to Win the 2017-2019 Apple Inc. iPhone Chip Business;4/26/2016;"The iPhone 6s came with either a Samsung or a TSMC built
    processor. Image credit: Apple.It has been widely reported thatApplehas chosenTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd, commonly referred to as TSMC, to manufacture its next
    generation A10 processor. Although there have not been reports
    around whether the Taiwan-based chipmaker has won Apple's next
    generation A11, A12, and A13 business, I believe it will.makeArticleAd();I will also go a step further and argue that not only will
    TSMC be ""looped in"" for the A11 and A12, but I believe that
    TSMC will win those processors exclusively. Here's why.The 10-nanometer A11According TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu on the company's fourth quarter
    earnings call, TSMC intends to start the 10-nanometer node with
    ""a very high market share"" and the company ""intend[s] not to
    lose it."" I suspect thatQualcommwill go withSamsungexclusively at the 10-nanometer node, so in order for TSMC to
    have ""very high"" share, it's probably necessary for it to win
    virtually all of the Apple business at this node.The 7-nanometer A12, A13TSMC has made it clear that it intends to go into mass
    production on what it refers to as the 7-nanometer node in the
    first half of 2018. This technology is expected to deliver
    improved performance/power consumption over the 10-nanometer
    node while at the same time delivering a roughly 1.6x
    improvement in logic density.A Samsung rep, on the other hand,toldEETimesthat ""10 [nanometer] will be a much longer node than other
    foundries are claiming it will be. We think 7 [nanometer] has
    to be defined and optimized to be cost effective to the masses,
    not just the high margin products.""It is likely that Samsung's ""10-nanometer"" and TSMC's
    ""10-nanometer"" nodes will be comparable in terms of transistor
    area (TSMC reportedly claims that its 10-nanometer will be
    denser, though).Interestingly Samsung seems to be planning for two variants
    of 10-nanometer, one known as 10LPE (an early version with
    lower performance) and 10LPP (a later one with greater
    performance). I suspect that Samsung will transition to 10LPP
    by the time TSMC moves to 7nm. Even if Samsung matches TSMC's
    7-nanometer in transistor performance with a move to 10LPP,
    TSMC should have significantly lower transistor area, allowing
    chip designers to pack more into a given chip footprint.This apparent technology superiority on TSMC's part in the
    2018-2019 time-frame leads me to believe that Apple will choose
    TSMC for both the A12 and the A13.If I'm right, this is good for TSMCApple brings a lot of volume to the table, and if TSMC can
    capture the bulk of, if not all of, it, then TSMC should have a
    ""guaranteed"" large customer for its latest manufacturing
    technologies for several years to come. This should allow the
    company to more confidently invest in research and development
    for future technologies beyond even the 7-nanometer node.The research and development spending required to fund
    future technologies is only going to go up from here, which
    means that the financial bar to continue funding future
    technologies will only continue to go up. My view is that TSMC
    should be set for the foreseeable future, but Samsung Foundry
    -- even though it appears to have its own captive volumes andQualcomm's volumes -- is on shaky ground.3 companies poised to explode when cable

GPRO Stock: Will GoPro Inc EVER Get Its Act Together?;4/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat was once a valid question is quickly becoming a rhetorical
one: WillGoPro Inc(GPRO) ever get its act together?Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)GPRO stock is down about 6% in midday trading Monday, after
Pacific Crest said the action camera-maker's inventory levels are
near all-time highs, a problem exacerbated by dramatically
lower sell-through of its products in the U.S., its main
market.makeArticleAd();The news seems to be just another speedbump in GoPro's long and
winding road to recovery - a recovery that doesn't quite seem to be
underway yet.With GPRO stock now down 26% in 2016 and 70% in the last year,
CEO Nick Woodman needs to get his act together and piece together a
turnaround, or shareholders might have a legitimate reason to oust
the founder.GPRO Succumbing to ""Soft Market""The company's problem, at its core, is simple: The action camera
market is cooling, and competitors - thinkCanon Inc (ADR)(CAJ),Nikon Corp (ADR)(NINOY),Samsung(SSNLF) andSony Corp (ADR)(SNE) - are flooding in.7 Stocks You Should Put Out to PastureThat's translating directly into slower selling … and thus
higher inventory. Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest currently has GPRO
stock at a ""Neutral"" rating, although these new data aren't at all
flattering. SaysErickson:""Our checks detected days of inventory at roughly three weeks
consistently over the past month, and we estimate aggregate
sell-through in the United States was down nearly 40% y/y in
Q1.""Now, thinking through this issue like a true investor, you might
say to yourself, ""OK, so sales are down from a year ago - that
still doesn't necessarily mean GPRO stock is in trouble. After all,
analysts might've seen this coming; GoPro shares could actually pop
if sales fell less than expected!""All of that is true. But it certainly doesn't look like GPRO is
primed to outperform expectations. Here's Erickson again:""Further, we estimate current sell-through run-rates are ranging
800,000 to 1 million units per quarter versus Street expectations
of ~1.1 million in Q2 and ~1.2 million to 1.3 million in Q3.""Those are good metrics for investors to know, particularly since
the oPro earnings date is sneaking up on us: The company
reports after the bell May 5.That will almost certainly not be a pretty day for GoPro,
as analysts expect revenue to fall off a cliff and crater
53.4%. The Street also expects the company to swing to a loss,
losing 60 cents per share compared to positive EPS of 24 cents in
Q1 2015.Bottom line? GPRO is in major trouble, and it's really, really
hard to see a feasible way out of its current hole.Sure, it's moving into sexy areas like drones and virtual
reality, but its action cameras are the only thing GoPro has
proved, and its next model, the Hero5, probably won't come out
untilOctober.Is a Key Acquisition Enough for GoPro
    (GPRO)?I doubt many people are lining up to pre-order thebig-ticket ""Omni,""either - a six-camera array that runs $4,999.Given GoPro's apparent strategy - keep selling old products
people aren't buying anymore and release new products at a
snail's pace - it's no wonderGPRO stock is universally hated by analysts.Drones may be cool and all, but it's time for GoPro to get its
head out of the clouds.As of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in

Did Qualcomm, Inc. Really Just Confirm Intel Corp. Inside the iPhone 7?;4/25/2016;"Image credit: Apple.On wireless chip giantQualcomm's most recent earnings call, CEO Steve Mollenkopf made a very
    curious statement. He first reiterated the company's prior
    forecast that, by the fourth quarter of its current fiscal
    year, its chip business would enjoy operating margins of ""16%
    of better."" The long-term target, he pointed out, is
    ""20%-plus.""makeArticleAd();After these claims, Mollenkopf made the following
    statement:""It is important to note that for planning purposes, both
    our near-term and long-term margin targets have consistently
    factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large
    customers, and we believe our margin targets are achievable
    under those scenarios.""This is hardly as direct as the statements that Qualcomm
    made in early 2015, when it announced that it would not be in
    theSamsungGalaxy S6/Note 5. That said, these statements have led many to
    believe that Qualcomm has confirmed that it will lose some
    share toIntelinside the upcoming iPhone 7-series phones.Should investors now assume that Intel has definitely won a
    spot inside the next-generationAppleiPhone? Let's take a closer look.It seems very possibleAt this point, Apple has certainly locked down the
    specifications of the iPhone 7, and the builds of components
    for the phone, if they're not already under way, should begin
    shortly. The fact that Qualcomm chose to remind investors that
    it has ""consistently factored in a range of second sourcing
    assumptions"" at major customersnowis a pretty big clue that the company sees very real potential
    for share loss at Apple.Any clues from Intel itself?Since Intel is the company that's expected to be the ""second
    source"" here, it's worthwhile to see if Intel itself offered
    any clues as to whether it has won this business.Combing through the comments that Intel management made on
    its April 19 call about the mobile business, I wasn't able to
    find anything that really strongly hints at such a win. Intel
    CEO Brian Krzanich did say that ""mobile is absolutely
    continuing to grow for us as a segment"" and claimed that
    profitability in this segment is improving.CFO Stacy Smith added some additional color, noting that
    both product-level gross margin improvements as well as cost
    cutting will contribute to the improvement in mobile operating
    margin this year.Winning roughly 30% (as rumored) of the Apple iPhone
    business isn't likely to do wonders for Intel's mobile efforts,
    but given how unsuccessful it has been to date, every little
    bit should help the company achieve its goal of improving
    mobile operating profit by (at least) $800 million.Watch for the tear-downsApple is expected to launch its next generation iPhones in
    September 2016, so keep an eye out for tear-downs then; Apple
    is unlikely to name the vendor(s) of the modems in its phones,
    nor is it likely to allow those vendors to directly speak about
    design wins in the next iPhone. Note that many of the tear-down
    sites are based in North America, and it's likely that any
    iPhone models purchased in that region are likely to use
    Qualcomm modems, if only for CDMA support, which Intel modems
    lack.An Intel modem is more likely to be found inside smartphones
    targeting emerging markets in which CDMA support is
    unimportant. I hope that the tear-down sites sample iPhones
    from various regions.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Qualcomm, Inc.: QCOM Slump Not a Red Flag for Apple Inc. (AAPL);4/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsWall Street landed a few blows onQualcomm, Inc.(QCOM) last week for scaling back its near-term global device shipment
  targets during its first-quarter earnings call.Apple Inc.(AAPL) got caught in the crossfire too, falling 1% on continued
  concerns of a slowdown in smartphone sales. But after listening
  to the QCOM call, I realized that the weakness in the smartphone
  supply chain may not be as big a drag on AAPL's margins as some
  seem to think.makeArticleAd();AAPL, QCOM and Smartphone QuestionsQualcomm stock shareholders shuddered to hear the company warn
  that mobile station modem (MSM) chip shipments in the current
  quarter are tracking 13%-22% below last year's levels. Since
  these MSM chips are used in higher-end phones, it's no surprise
  that smartphone sales have been downtrending.And becauseSamsung(SSNLF) and AAPL dominate the high end of that market, weakness for
  QCOM raises questions around the manufacturers. After all, it's
  hard to reconcile a two-digit drop in component shipments with
  continued strength for the companies that need those chips to
  sell phones.7 Stocks to Buy Before Summer ArrivesBut while management wasn't exactly eager to name names during
  the earnings call, it was easy to read between the lines. CEO
  Steven Mollenkopf told us that one ""premium-tier ecosystem"" has
  slowed its upgrade ramp. That's obviously AAPL, where less
  intensive innovation through the iPhone 6 cycle has curbed
  consumers' appetite to buy an incrementally better phone ahead of
  the iPhone 7 launch.Mollenkopf also admitted that AAPL's slowing ramp triggered a
  ""slight"" downturn in QCOM's global shipment numbers, but we knew
  about that already. We can see the sales trend written on theApple stockchart itself: down more than 4% in the fourth quarter of
  2015.And yet, management was relatively cheery throughout the call,
  talking about how QCOM's product mix was moving toward smaller
  volumes of more powerful chips for higher-end phones. Overall,
  the company is becoming less of a mass-market supplier and
  increasingly allied to manufacturers that focus on big price
  points and ultimately more profitable devices. That's the AAPL
  strategy at its core.The real elephant in the room is its other major customer,
  Samsung, which QCOM admits is creating ""a significant delta"" in
  the year-over-year trends.That's actually not a shock: Samsung opted about a year ago to
  swap its own chips into the sockets QCOM previously filled,
  taking its phones out of the equation. While a few Galaxy models
  have added QCOM back into the build, the absence of that huge
  slice of the smartphone universe is probably the factor prompting
  the double-digit MSM chip decline.But none of that is a red flag for AAPL. The smartphone
  universe is not collapsing, as far as QCOM can see. Overall
  volumes are cooling a little - the company now expects 4% to 10%
  growth in global phone sales this year, down from a 7% to 13%
  target three months ago - but there's no cliff in those
  numbers.Smartphones have been a tale of two markets for years now.
  There's AAPL and Samsung sharing the high end, and then there's
  everyone else.QCOM lost one of those partners on the high end, so we should
  expect some erosion there.But the next generation of iPhones will hit consumers soon
  enough, and both Apple stock and Qualcomm stock will continue to
  surge forward as they have been.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority. She is an accomplished investment specialist and market

Things Could Get Even Worse for Fitbit Stock If Apple Makes This Move;4/23/2016;"Image source: Fitbit.As if things weren't already looking bleak forFitbit-- it's stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 months
    -- it appears they could get even worse ifApplestarts moving down-market to more basic wearable devices.That's what analysts from Pacific Crest believe will happen
    (first reportedon Barron's), and there's some sound logic behind their
    speculation. Firstly, the analysts argue that Apple is already
    deeply committed to the wearable technology market, and for
    that very reason it's likely Apple will eventually release
    different types of wearable devices -- just as there are
    different iPads, Macs, and iPhones.makeArticleAd();Secondly, they say there's a definite demand for wearable
    tech, but not necessarily for the features of the Apple Watch.
    They said that ""... consumers appear to prefer a
    simplified and relatively inconspicuous version of technology
    that collects information while leaving complex interactions to
    devices that are better suited for the task.""The evidence of this comes from sales of the Apple Watch in
    2015, which were estimated at 10 million. Meanwhile, Fitbit
    sold 21 million fitness trackers, and total wearable sales were
    78 million in the same year. That shows that despite Apple's
    large user base, branding, and marketing, it still doesn't grab
    the lion's share of the wearables market.But that could change soon.Apple unlikely to stopHow about the Apple iTracker?OK, I just made that name up, but
    the idea is that Apple could add another wearable tech device
    into the mix, and clobber the competition.Already, the Apple Watch made somehuge gainson Fitbit in the eight months after it launched, and the iMaker
    could bring down Fitbit even further if it decidedly entered
    the basic fitness tracker market.A cheaper Apple wearable device would put it in even more
    direct competition with Fitbit's more basic offerings, and
    allow Apple the opportunity to target users who want a fitness
    tracker or basic wearable, without shelling out $300 (or more)
    for a high-end Apple Watch.And at this point it seems nearly inevitable that Apple will
    move in this direction. Using Fitbit as an example, the company
    recently tried to expand its own wearable market share by
    releasing the Blaze smartwatch. That gives Fitbit a bigger
    wearable footprint than Apple.Samsunghas made a similar move to expand its wearable reach across
    multiple price segments.Grabbing a $40 billion marketApple doesn't want to leave any money on the table in the
    wearables market, and stubbornly staying in just the high-end
    smartwatch segment would do that.The overall wearables market will be worth $40 billion by
    2020, and 320 million units are forecast to be shipped that
    year, according toIHS. That's simply too big of a market for Apple to limit itself
    to just smartwatches.Research firm IDCrecently wrotethat there's room in the wearable space for both smartwatches
    and fitness trackers:While there has been clear growth in the wearable market,
      there has been little sign of product cannibalization. Smart
      watches have drawn increased attention to the market from the
      likes of Apple, Motorola, Pebble, and Samsung, but this has
      not dampened interest in fitness trackers.And this leaves plenty of room for Apple to enter the market
    without hurting sales of its smartwatch.A new, cheaper Apple fitness tracker could act as an
    introductory device to get Apple users who aren't already into
    wearable tech hooked on the concept. This would give Apple the
    opportunity to later convince them to spend more and get an
    Apple Watch further down the road. And if it can do that, then
    it could truly own the wearable tech market, and largely at
    Fitbit's expense.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't
      miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their

This Research Report Is Horrible News for Apple;4/22/2016;"TrendForce expects Apple's current-gen iPhone line is
    struggling. Source: AppleIf you follow technology, everythingAppledoes tends to be overstated. There's a cottage industry of
    journalists churning out headline-grabbing articles about the
    iPhone maker daily. As such, every move from the iPhone maker
    tends to be overstated. However, Apple's second-quarter
    earnings may be the most-important report the company has had
    in years.makeArticleAd();After releasing the iPhone in 2007, the device quickly
    became Apple's top product. Over the last year, approximately
    two-thirds of Apple's top line was due to iPhone sales. iPhone
    unit growth significantly slowed to 0.41%. On a revenue basis,
    Apple grew its iPhone revenue less than 1% last quarter on a
    year-on-year basis, a much larger slowdown than the 36% the
    company produced in the prior quarter.Source: Apple's quarterly reports. Revenue figures in
    millions.Even Apple CEO Tim Cook admits the company expects unit
    sales to drop in the second quarter. But if the newest report
    from Taiwan's TrendForce is correct, iPhone shipments are not
    just dropping -- they're cratering.A drop of 31%?According to TrendForce, Apple is expected to report it shipped
    42 million iPhone units in the first quarter (Apple's second
    fiscal quarter). For most phone vendors, 42 million high-end
    units would be a great year but Apple is no ordinary company.
    In last year's corresponding quarter Apple reported shipping
    61.2 million units. TrendForce estimates Apple shipped 31%
    fewer units on a year-on-year basis. If correct, Apple appears
    well on its way to an underwhelming earnings report.Trendforce's report is bad news all around for Apple. The
    market research firm reports the overall smartphone market
    declined 1.3% in the first quarter, which means Apple
    significantly underperformed the entire market. Additionally,
    TrendForce estimates Apple will ship 213 million units in the
    calendar year, down 10% from last-year's total.On the other hand, TrendForce notesSamsungshipped more units than expected as a result of moving up the
    Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge's release date to the
    first quarter and increased promotional activities. TrendForce
    upgraded its projections of Samsung shipments to 316 million
    units this year, which is roughly the figure it shipped last
    year.What's Apple without iPhone growth?Even though Apple has attempted to bring new products and
    services to the fold, the company continues to be tied to the
    iPhone. As the graph above shows, the iPhone has grown from
    57.1% of Apple's total revenue haul two years ago to 68.1% last
    quarter. During this period Apple's introduced Apple Music,
    Apple Watch, and refreshed Macs and iPhones. However, Apple's
    future remains tied to the iPhone.TrendForce's estimates appear lower than other firms.
    EarlierCredit Suisseanalyst Kulbinder Garcha cut the firms estimates of iPhone
    sales from 55 million to 48 million.Piper Jaffrayalso lowered estimates to 55 million, down from prior
    predictions of 62.5 million.This quarter will provide insight into how the iPhone will
    perform now that the device's hyper-growth period has passed.
    Apple appears undervalued on many metrics, which points to the
    fact many investors expect slower growth going forward.
    However, if Apple reports a 31% unit shipment decrease in its
    most important product, it could further depress the company's
    valuation multiples.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

2 Causes for Concern Ahead of Apple's Earnings Report;4/22/2016;"Source: AppleApple's earnings report on Monday figures to be a historic one,
    though for all the wrong reasons.makeArticleAd();Amid a slowing market for smartphones and tablets, the
    world's largest publicly traded company is expected to report
    its first year-over-year revenue contraction in more than a
    decade.  Worse yet, a number of recent data points from
    within Apple's supplier ecosystem have indicated that the
    weakening demand for its wares may be more severe than was
    previously thought.Suppliers troubleLast week, Apple supplierTaiwan Semiconductorforecast second-quarter sales well below analysts' 
    expectations.  The culprit? Falling sales in the
    smartphone and personal computer markets, which will crimp
    demand for the chips the firm produces. All told, Taiwan
    Semiconductor believes its sales in the current quarter will be
    between $6.6 billion  and $6.7 billion, roughly 5% below
    the $7.0 billion  analysts had previously forecast.For those unfamiliar with Taiwan Semiconductor, it's the
    world's largest third-party semiconductor manufacturer .
    Along with smartphone rivalSamsung, it partners with Apple to help produce the A-series chips
    that power its various mobile devices. (Intelchips power Apple's Mac lineup.)Though Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't publicly disclose
    precisely how much it sells to whom, analysts estimate Apple
    accounts for roughly 16%  of its revenue, so the soft
    sales forecast predictably led to speculation that the cause
    was slowing demand for iPhones, which could mean more trouble
    in Apple's current quarter.And Taiwan Semiconductor isn't the only Apple supplier about
    which reports of softening demand have been made recently.Late last week, Japanese news outletNikkei Asian Reviewpublished an article claiming that weakening demand for the
    current iPhone lineup has led Apple to slash orders from a host
    of its suppliers. Specifically, the article asserted that Apple
    decreased its component orders fromJapan Display,Sharp,Toshiba, andSonyby as much as 30% in its fiscal second quarter, for which Apple
    will report earnings on Monday. Worse yet,Nikkei Asian Reviewalso claims that demand for Apple's smartphones has remained
    depressed into its current quarter. So just how concerning
    should Apple investors find this news?The bigger pictureReading these reports, it's hard not to find the situation at
    least somewhat alarming. The iPhone accounted for 66%  of
    Apple's fiscal 2015 revenue, and likely a higher percentage of
    the Mac maker's profits. Given that, Apple's guidance on
    Monday could well disappoint the market, a result that can
    weigh heavily on any stock. However, it's also important to
    remember that the weakening demand could also prove to be a
    symptom of iPhone demand shifting from one quarter to another,
    rather than disappearing altogether.Apple will all but assuredly refresh the iPhone's form
    factor with the iPhone 7, which is expected to be released this
    fall. At this point, the iPhone product cycle has become so
    well-established that consumers shopping for new smartphones
    could rationally wait to upgrade their handsets until the new
    design reaches the market. Unfortunately, it isn't clear that
    customers postponing their purchases until the iPhone 7's
    release are the driving force behind the decline in iPhone
    sales.For example, rival devices like Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7
    Edge are apparently being generally well-received by the
    market.  What's more, evidence of a broader slowing of
    growth among premium handsets could point to a maturing market
    or longer upgrade cycles becoming increasingly common in the
    market in general.  It isn't clear how robust any of these
    trends are or to what degree they could impact Apple
    specifically. Either way, they certainly deserve consideration
    ahead of Apple's upcoming earnings release after the market
    closes Monday.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Will An All-Glass AMOLED iPhone Boost Apple Inc. Stock?;4/22/2016;"Shares ofApplehave fallen 14% over the past 12 months due to concerns that
    sales of the iPhone, its top source of revenue, will peak this
    year. iPhone sales inched up just 1% annually  last
    quarter, and Apple's guidance for a 9% to 14% sales decline for
    the current quarter indicated that demand was drying up.A recent report from Trendforce claims  that global
    iPhone shipments fell nearly 24% annually during the first
    quarter, and the firm warns that the new 4"" iPhone SE will
    ""face severe price competition from Chinese branded products""
    in its target mid-range market.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.As a result, Apple faces tremendous pressure to make major
    technological and cosmetic improvements to future iPhones. But
    recent leaks indicate that this year's iPhone 7 will look
    similar to the iPhone 6s, and that its biggest improvement
    could be a dual-camera setup  for better pictures.But looking further ahead, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi
    Kuo believes that Apple will dramatically alter  the
    iPhone next year by replacing its aluminum chassis with an
    all-glass enclosure, and replace its LCD screen with an AMOLED
    one. Would such an eleventh-hour move revive interest in the
    iPhone?Is Apple running out of ideas?If Kuo's report is accurate, Apple would be following Android
    device design trends.Samsunghas used AMOLED displays ever since the Galaxy S1, and it added
    curved glass screens to the Galaxy S6 Edge last year.Xiaomi,Oppo,Lenovo, and many other OEMs have also produced phones with glass
    backs or all-glass exteriors. Apple also used glass backs with
    the iPhone 4 and 4s. Those stylish handsets were prone to
    crack, but Kuo believes that Apple will use tougher glass to
    address that issue, and that glass would be ideal for wireless
    charging and boosting reception.Introducing an all-glass AMOLED iPhone might impress diehard
    Apple fans, but it also seems to be an admission that Android
    OEMs -- which were once considered ""iPhone knockoff"" makers --
    are now moving ahead of the design curve. Apple could
    potentially add  its patented and long-rumored
    ""wraparound"" display design to the all-glass exterior, butLGalso recently won  a similar patent, indicating that it
    might launch such a futuristic device before Apple.All-glass phones: Lenovo's S850 (L) and Oppo's A31 (R).
    Image source: Company websites.Apple is treading water...Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple treads water more often than it swims
    forward. Cook has tried using a scattergun strategy to boost
    iPad sales, adding smaller and larger screen sizes along with
    keyboards for productivity purposes. Yet those tactics seem
    unlikely to break the tablet's eight consecutive quarters of
    annual sales declines.That strategy is now bleeding over to the iPhone, causing
    the company to launch 4-inch devices to reach untapped markets.
    That strategy might work if Apple lowers the price to around
    $100 for developing and emerging markets, but the company
    stubbornly set the price at $400 to $500, keeping it out of
    reach of those consumers.According to analytics firm Mixpanel, only 24% of iPhone
    users own an  iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, while 43% still use
    the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. That big disparity indicates that many
    iPhone 6 users, unimpressed by the iPhone 6s' incremental
    upgrades, simply stuck with their ""good enough"" devices. The
    iPhone 7 could suffer the same fate if it doesn't offer
    game-changing improvements. Since most carriers no longer
    subsidize iPhones with two-year contracts, longtime iPhone
    users will likely hold onto their devices a bit longer -- which
    could cause iPad-like sales declines.But can it swim forward?Apple knows that it needs to diversify away from the iPhone,
    which generated nearly 70% of its revenue last quarter.
    However, new efforts like Apple Pay, Apple Music, and the Apple
    Watch still account for single-digit percentages of its top
    line, while therumored ""Apple Car"" probably won't arrive until 2019. Sales of
    iPads and Macs have also been sluggish due to ongoing declines
    in both the tablet and PC markets.So until Apple's other businesses start generating more
    meaningful sales, all eyes will remain fixed on the iPhone,
    which is running out of ways to win over new users. I believe
    that the company is gradually falling behind Samsung and other
    OEMs in terms of hardware design, and introducing an all-glass
    AMOLED iPhone might not be enough to close the gap next
    year.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Should you Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?;4/20/2016;"From January to mid-February, the S&P 500 lost over 10% of
its value.  Since then, the market has recovered its losses,
and the S&P 500 is currently up 3.5% year-to-date. 
Apple'sAAPLshare price has mimicked a similar story, and its stock has been in
line with the market's ups and downs so far in 2016.  However,
this could all change on the 25thof April.On this day, Apple will be reporting its second quarter earnings
of fiscal 2016.  How will Apple perform, and can it
differentiate itself from the broader stock market?Apple generated 68% of its revenues from the iPhone last
quarter.  It's worth noting that in 2015, the iPhone generated
66.3% of the company's revenues.  There is a lot of dependence
on this single product to drive growth for the company.  Thismakes the company more risky to invest in, which is part of why Apple is trading at a low forward PE
multiple of 11.98.Apple's iPhone sales are stagnating in terms of growth, so
investors are waiting to see if the company can bring forth a new
growth driver.  Apple Pay seems intriguing, but there's no
telling as to how big it will get at this point.  Apple Pay is
a great product, but one must remember that the mobile payment
space has other big participants, such as SamsungSSNLFand GoogleGOOGL.  This new spacewill continue to see other competitors rise, increasing the risk of people moving away from Apple Pay.Apple is also exposed to the harshconditions in the macroeconomic environment.  Global volatility contributes towards why sales are
projected to decrease by 3.58% this year.  Apple generated 60%
of its sales outside of the Americas in 2015, and China is the
company's next growth frontier.  The Chinese are doing what
they can to keep up with growth expectations, but they are
faltering.  In spite of propping up equity markets with funds
and devaluing the Yuan (China's currency), growth concerns continue
to linger.Earnings estimate revisions have been mixed for this
quarter.  In the last 60 days, there have been six earnings
estimate revisions by financial analysts.  Two revisions were
made upwards, while the other four were revised downwards. 
This has pushed our EPS consensus estimate down over the last 90
days.  Three months ago, our earnings consensus estimated
earnings of $2.20 per share this quarter.  Now, we estimate
earnings of $1.97 this quarter.Bottom LineApple has beaten our EPS in each of the last four quarters, and
there's a good chance that this quarter won't be an
exception.  However, each earnings beat has been quite modest
over the last year.  Apple only beat our EPS consensus by
1.23% last quarter.  Even if the company does beat on our
bottom line consensus estimate, there are some unappealing facts
which can't be overlooked.Apple is very reliant on its iPhone, and there has been no clear
sidekick to help in diversifying the company's revenues.  iPad
sales have been inconsistent, and the Mac has not been a superb
growth candidate, either.  When you add in the fact that 60%
of the company's sales are outside of the Americas, it becomes
pretty clear that the company could make for a risky bet.  The
volatility in 2016 will definitely impact the world's willingness
to pay for premium products from Apple.The cell phone market is growing more and more competitive by
the year.  Will Apple be able to differentiate the iPhone from
its competitors' phones over the long run? Will someone else ever
make a better phone than the Apple's?  If the company ever
gets any of these questions wrong, its share price will be
decimated.  You don't want to be around when/if that happens,
and I can't recommend the stock unless it has proven itself with a
new product capable of properly diversifying the company's
sales.  Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Rank is a truly marvelous trading tool.  Our
ranking system has beaten the S&P 500, yielding an average
return of 25% per year for the last 29 years!  Want the latest

BlackBerry's Next Smartphone Will Be a Lot Cheaper;4/20/2016;"BlackBerry PRIV. Image source: BlackBerry.BlackBerryis selling fewer and fewer smartphones.makeArticleAd();The Canadian phone maker recognized revenue on 3.2
    million handsets in its last fiscal year, which ended in
    February. That's down from 7 million in the same period 12
    months earlier. As a percentage of total revenue, hardware
    slipped from 42.9% to 40%. During its fourth quarter,
    BlackBerry's handset sales contracted to just 600,00 units,
    down from 1.3 million devices in the same quarter last
    year.This comes in the wake of a major transition in BlackBerry's
    handset business. Late last year, BlackBerry launched the PRIV,
    its first smartphone powered byAlphabet's Android operating system. Unfortunately,
    the handset seems to have fallen short of management's
    expectations. On BlackBerry's earnings call earlier this month,
    CEO John Chen admitted that the company would change its
    strategy going forward.Asking for far too muchIn the U.S., the BlackBerry PRIV retails for around $700 --
    about the same price as a standard Android flagship, such asSamsung's Galaxy S7 andLG's G5. But it's not 2007 anymore: Although BlackBerry pioneered
    the smartphone market, it isn't as established as its now far
    more dominant rivals, particularly in the Android space.
    Moreover, the PRIV doesn't offer particularly impressive value.
    Its hardware keyboard is certainly unique, but the rest of its
    specs and its processor are downright pedestrian or even modest
    compared to its competitors.It isn't particularly shocking, then, that the Priv failed
    to take the world by storm. There were other factors, to be
    certain -- the Priv suffered from limited carrier support and a
    sluggish rollout. (""Unfortunately,
    contract negotiations took longer than planned with
    certain major carriers,"" Chen said during the company's
    earnings call.) Still, it brought questionable value to a
    crowded smartphone market.""[The Priv has] done reasonably well in the [United States].
    We've done reasonably well...in Canada, in Hong Kong, in major
    metro cities like in Singapore and so forth,"" Chen said. As for
    emerging markets? ""Because of the tiering of the PRIV and it's
    a pretty high-end product, it tends to be more of the developed
    economies.""Will a $400 Android phone fare much better?Chen fundamentally believes that the PRIV is a solid product,
    but suffers from a poor price point. He believes the company
    could sell far more PRIVs were it priced more aggressively:One of the problems that we ran into in the last quarter,
      people [do] like our PRIV, but there's a much more limited
      audience [for high-end smartphones], and that particular
      market, that segment seems to be quite saturated at this
      point. So people would love PRIV but it would be a move down
      one level in price point, and so we're looking to address
      that.Later, in an interview withThe National, Chen was more specific:The fact that we came out with a high-end phone was
      probably not as wise as it should have been...A lot of
      enterprise customers have said to us, 'I want to buy your
      phone but $700 is a little too steep for me. I'm more
      interested in a $400 device.'In January, Chen said the company planned to release one or
    two new Android devices in 2016. It seems likely that they'll
    priced far more affordably than last year's PRIV. But will that
    be enough to jump-start BlackBerry's handset business? Before
    it moved to Android, BlackBerry was offering something unique
    in the form of an integrated hardware-software platform that
    emphasized security and a physical keyboard. Its move to
    Android did away with its proprietary software; now, Chen seems
    to be emphasizing security above all else.""Our value proposition, that is to offer the most secure
    Android smartphone for the enterprise, is actually quite
    strong,"" he said on the earnings call.  ""We're the only
    people who really secure Android, taking the security features
    of BlackBerry that everyone knows us for and make it more
    reachable for the market,"" he told The National.It's somewhat troubling that the PRIV's price point would be
    a problem among enterprise customers, perhaps the single group
    of buyers best able to absorb greater costs. In a report
    released last year, Good Technology (a company BlackBerry has
    since acquired) noted that the iPhone 6 was the single most
    popular smartphone among enterprise customers during the first
    quarter of 2015, and that Samsung's Galaxy S5 was the most
    popular Android phone. At the time, both handsets retailed for
    upwards of $600.Either enterprise demand for high-end handsets just isn't
    what it once was just 12 months ago, or BlackBerry's handsets
    are facing much more pressing problems than price.""If we cannot make money on the device business...then I
    will have to get out of that particular business,"" Chen
    said.As quickly as it arrived, Alphabet could be down a hardware
    partner.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Bad News for Apple and Samsung: Mobile Phone Upgrade Cycles Are Slowing;4/20/2016;"Not that long ago it wasn't unusual for most us to
    impatiently wait for our two-year cell phone contract to pass
    so that we could upgrade to the latest phone. We'd head down to
    the nearest wireless carrier store and scope out the new
    phones, hoping that maybe we were eligible for an
    early upgrade.But those days are largely over, according to new
    information fromCitigroup.Americans now take an average of 29 months to upgrade their
    cell phone, up from 28 months at the end of last year, and an
    increase of 24 to 26 months that was typical just a couple of
    years ago, as noted in a recentWall Street Journalarticle.And just four years ago, the upgrade cycle was just 22
    months.makeArticleAd();T-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS),Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) andAT&Tare largely to blame for the change. Ever since T-Mobile
    ditched two-year service agreements, Verizon and AT&T
    eventually followed suit (as didSprint,before it brought them back) and that's given consumers a
    clear perspective on exactly how much they're really paying for
    their devices.Once they caught a glimpse of the real price of the devices
    they use -- as opposed to it being hidden in a subsidized cell
    phone contract -- they've decided to hold onto their phones
    just a bit longer.For the most part, this isn't all that bad for wireless
    carriers. Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said
    last month that there wasn't any profit from device sales
    anyway because all the carriers sold the phones at cost.But if users are taking longer to upgrade their phones, it's
    clear that this could be a problem for two of the biggest
    smartphone makers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF).Both companies now have their ownyearly smartphone upgrade plans, which allow customers to pay the companies directly for their
    device each month, choose any of the four U.S. wireless
    providers, and then trade in their smartphone every 12 months
    for the latest model.Piper Jaffrayanalyst Gene Munstersaid back in Februarythat he believed Apple has already sold about 250,000 iPhones
    through its upgrade program, which could definitely be
    considered a success given that it debuted not too long ago.
    But Munster made a prediction that the iPhone upgrade program
    would also lower the device's upgrade cycle, which appears
    unlikely now.Originally, Munster thought the program would reduce the
    average iPhone user's upgrade time frame from 22 months to only
    15 months. But that 15 month time frame would mean iPhone users
    would be upgrading their phones14 monthsearlier than the average American, based on Citigroup's new
    data. And with Apple's iPhone sales currently slowing, that
    quick upgrade time seems even more unlikely.And as for Samsung...It's a been a rocky road for Samsung's smartphone business over
    the past year or so. The Galaxy S6 fizzled without much
    fanfare, and left even the most die-hard Samsung fans
    disappointed. Sentiment seemed be turning back to Samsung with
    the recent release of the new Galaxy S7, but the early positive
    reports may have come from theaggressive promotional activity, and not true consumer demand.If demand is weak (or weakening) for the S7 shortly after
    its launch, then longer upgrade cycles are certainly not
    welcome news for Samsung. Its upgrade program is just a few
    months old, so we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out if
    it's helping to drive sales -- but at this point it doesn't
    sound like investors should hold their breath for that.What these companies really needThe CEO of AT&T's entertainment group, John Stankey, may
    have put it best at an investor conference last month. Stankey
    said that smartphones are becoming more like the former PC
    market, ""where ultimately over time you saw more virtualization
    of service occurring and there was less of a burning need to
    get into the upgrade cycle for the next new chip and the next
    new OS to gain access to it."" Basically, there aren't enough
    great new smartphone features to justify frequent upgrades.If Apple and Samsung want consumers to return the glory days
    of short upgrade cycles, then the tech companies need to offer
    up devices that help force their hand. And that's starting to
    look harder to accomplish than ever before.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple Inc.: Why Would Apple Overhaul the iPhone AGAIN?;4/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Sunday, Mac news sites began publishing a report by KGI
Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggesting thatApple Inc.(AAPL) is looking to switch to anall-glass iPhone in 2017.Source: Brad MoonIf the report holds up, this would be a massive move,
considering Apple switched to an aluminum case design after the
iPhone 4s. When itreleased the iPhone 5 in 2012, the aluminum design was one of the headline features of the new
iPhone.makeArticleAd();Since then, other smartphone manufacturers have been playing
catch-up.Numerous companies ditched their plastic cases in an effort to
match the premium aluminum and glass look of the Apple
iPhone. EvenSamsung(SSNLF) adopted the metal look with the Galaxy S6, abandoning the Galaxy
smartphones' signature polycarbonate shell and losing key features
like its removable battery in the process.Apple iPhone: From Glass and Back AgainAfter building up aluminum as the ideal premium material for
smartphones, why would Apple abandon the metal for a new
iPhone? And why would it go back to glass, of all materials? After
all, the company had to endure a period of negative publicity when
the all-glass iPhone 4 was released and turned out to bemuch more prone to breakingthan previous models.Well, here are a few reasons I can think of:With iPhone sales sliding, Apple needssomeway to convince current iPhone owners to upgrade. New features
  don't always do that, but an all-""new"" look might.Everyone else is doing aluminum now, so the latest iPhones
  don't visually stand out from the pack.Plastic still looks low-rent, so that leaves glass if Apple
  wants to change the look of the iPhone while keeping its
  flagship visual appeal.The first point in particular is a big one as Apple tries to
kickstart iPhone upgrade cycles.7 Companies That Will Rule AIThe problem with iterative design changes - the iPhone 6 to 6s
and likely the iPhone 7 as well - is that it's not easy to tell
that someone is carrying the latest new iPhone at a glance. Apple
counts on some of its customers as being the type who like to be
seen with the latest and greatest devices, but this demographic
hasn't necessarily felt the need to upgrade in several years.Switching to an all-glass form factor would mean there is no
mistaking a new iPhone for last year's model, or any Android
smartphone for that matter. Apple would be counting on this visible
change to drive another round of iPhone upgrades.Lets not forget that using visual design changes to sell new
products has been an Apple favorite for decades: new colors of
iMacs, iPods, iPhones and iPads have often been used to try to
spark sales.Of course going to an all-glass enclosure for a new iPhone
brings some risks. It sounds like an anticipated moved to OLED
displays in 2017 will offset any weight gains, but the fact remains
that glass is more fragile than metal.Expect iPhone case makers to do a booming business if that new
iPhone in 2017 does turn out to be all-glass.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceReview: Galaxy S7 EdgeReview: iPhone SE6 of the Best iPhone 6 CasesThe postApple Inc.: Why Would Apple Overhaul the iPhone

Qualcomm Braces for Another Big Hit;4/18/2016;"It wasn't that long ago thatQualcommseemed to have it made, having largely beaten rivalIntelto the punch in capitalizing on the huge growth opportunity
    that mobile technology gave it. Yet more recently, those roles
    have reversed themselves, and it's Intel that has found ways to
    bounce back even as Qualcomm struggles. As investors prepare
    for Qualcomm's fiscal second-quarter financial report on
    Wednesday, they anticipate another round of massive declines on
    the top and bottom lines, and it's critical for the company to
    find a long-term strategy that will help it get out of its
    downturn. Let's take an early look at what people are expecting
    from Qualcomm this quarter and what could lie ahead for the
    company going forward.Image source: Qualcomm.What will Qualcomm say?Investors are downbeat about Qualcomm's fiscal second-quarter
    prospects. They're predicting a 23% drop in revenue to $5.34
    billion, and the consensus forecast calls for earnings of $0.96
    per share, down almost a third from what it earned in the same
    quarter last year. The company has done a good job in past
    quarters of outpacing the expectations that investors have set
    for it, producing earnings beats of between $0.04 and $0.07 per
    share in each of the past four quarters. Yet even if Qualcomm
    can post better-than-expected earnings, it is still likely to
    be a big drop compared to last year.makeArticleAd();Moreover, Qualcomm investors have become more pessimistic in
    just the past few months. Recently, they've cut their forecast
    for fiscal second-quarter earnings projections by $0.06 per
    share, and they've reduced their full-year earnings calls for
    this year and next by 2% to 3%. Still, the stock has bounced
    back somewhat, climbing 11% since mid-January.Qualcomm's fiscal first-quarter results in late January
    showed the continuing downward trajectory that the company's
    business has seen. Revenue was down 19%, accelerating from the
    previous quarter's decline, and net income fell by 24%.
    Weakness in both the semiconductor and licensing business was
    unusual for Qualcomm, but company executives noted that as poor
    as the chipmaker's performance was, it was better than most had
    expected. CEO Steve Mollenkopf said that he expected Qualcomm's
    results to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.What's ahead for Qualcomm?One reason why things are looking for Qualcomm is that the
    chipmaker has won some big victories in getting its chips into
    important devices. The chipmaker's Snapdragon 820 processor
    successfully made it into the newSamsungGalaxy S7, reversing the defeat that Samsung dealt Qualcomm
    last year in denying a spot for the then-cutting edge
    Snapdragon 810 processor for the Galaxy S6. Moreover, other
    mobile device makers will use the new Snapdragon 820 as well,
    and that should help to get Qualcomm back into its leadership
    role versus Intel and other players in the space.In addition, Qualcomm has made some progress in helping to
    support its licensing business as well. New agreements with
    major mobile device producers in China, includingLenovoandXiaomi, point to a potential solution in Qualcomm's long-running
    problem of defending its intellectual property in a legal
    system that doesn't give as much protection as tech giants are
    used to getting elsewhere across the globe.Qualcomm does need to keep an eye on Intel, although the two
    companies appear to be following different strategies. Intel
    recently hired a former Qualcomm executive who had played a
    major role in Qualcomm's mobile success, but critics argue that
    the Intel culture will make it difficult for someone from
    outside the fold to have a marked impact. More importantly,
    Intel needs to figure out whether it wants to try to challenge
    Qualcomm on the high-end performance side of the market. The
    low-end discounting strategy Intel has followed hasn't been a
    big threat to Qualcomm as of yet.In the Qualcomm earnings report, watch to see how the
    company sees itself pulling out of its downturn. Soon,
    year-over-year comparisons should look a lot better for the
    company, and that could be all that investors need in order to
    feel better about Qualcomm's prospects in the future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple Inc. Reportedly Signs Huge OLED Deal With Samsung Display;4/18/2016;"Image source: Apple.According to a report from The Korea Herald (viaMacRumors),SamsungDisplay is expected to begin supplyingApplewith 5.5-inch OLED displays in 2017. Presumably, these displays
    are intended for a next-generation Plus series iPhone.makeArticleAd();Per the report, this deal is worth a total of $2.59 billion
    and is said to be for 100 million 5.5-inch OLED panels per year
    for at least three years.Let's take a look at the implications of this deal.If the value is correct, Apple is getting OLED panels
    on the cheapIf the agreement is for three years' worth of supply, and if
    Apple is getting approximately 100 million panels per year,
    then this would imply that it is paying $2.59 billion for a
    total of 300 million panels.If this deal value is correct, then this would suggest that
    Apple is only going to pay an average of around $8.63 per
    5.5-inch OLED display. Given that these panels are going to be
    critical components of the premium 2017 iPhones (which should
    start at $749 and go all the way up to $949 if the current
    pricing structure holds), that seems like a very good per-panel
    price.Even if we assume that the $2.59 billion figure is on anannualbasis, this would imply a price-per-panel of around $26. This
    is obviously much greater than about $8.63, but for
    state-of-the-art panels that are only headed to Apple's
    highest-end and most expensive phones, this wouldn't be
    terrible.Is this another way Apple plans to differentiate small
    from big?Apple has shown that it will add additional features to its
    higher-end iPhones relative to the lower-end ones. This is an
    extremely sensible move due simply to the fact that the
    larger-screen phones sell for more than the smaller-screen ones
    do, which allows Apple to put more features in for a given
    gross profit margin structure.The report explicitly mentions 5.5-inch panels and doesn't
    mention 4.7-inch or 4-inch displays. This may suggest that
    Apple intends to use the more advanced OLED displays on its
    pricier 5.5-inch models as a way to further differentiate its
    largest iPhones from its smaller brethren.Such a strategy would hardly be unique. For example,
    China-based smartphone maker Huawei employed such a strategy
    with its recently launched P9 and P9 Plus flagships; the
    smaller and cheaper P9 features an LCD while the larger P9 Plus
    packs an OLED panel.I think that this point of differentiation alone could drive
    a non-trivial number potential customers to buy the higher-end
    5.5-inch model over the smaller 4.7-inch one.100 million seems like a lot, though...Apple ships just over 200 million iPhones per year, and even if
    the iPhone 7 proves a smash hit and the follow-on series an
    even bigger hit, I can't imagine iPhone sales pushing past
    roughly 250 million units on an annual basis anytime soon.It is generally believed that the 4.7-inch iPhones tend to
    dramatically outsell the 5.5-inch iPhones, perhaps at a ratio
    of 2:1 in favor of the smaller model.Even if we assume thatallof the, let's call it 250 million, units that are sold between
    Sept. 2017 and Sept. 2018 are the newest iPhone series (an
    extremely unlikely scenario), this would suggest Apple would
    only need around 83 million 5.5-inch OLED panels.Furthermore, it strikes me as odd that Apple would
    sole-source (which is what such quantities of display orders
    would mean) OLED displays from its archrival Samsung. I would
    expectLG Displayto enter the fray for a late 2017 iPhone and Japan Display to
    supply OLEDs to Apple starting in 2018, per the company's
    public statements.OLED on iPhone is sure to happen, but this report may
    not be getting the details rightThere is zero doubt in my mind that Apple aims to transition at
    least a portion of its iPhone lineup to OLEDs and that it would
    like to do it sooner rather than later. However, I am skeptical
    of the details given in this report from The Korea Herald,
    particularly around the quantities discussed.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Why Apple Inc. Won't Skip AMOLED Displays;4/18/2016;"Image source: Apple.Mark Hibben, writing for Seeking Alpha, recentlycast doubton the rumors thatApplewill eventually transition from using liquid crystal displays
    (LCDs) to using AMOLED displays for its popular iPhone line of
    smartphones.makeArticleAd();Hibben first noted that current-generation AMOLED displays
    suffer from ""burn in"" issues as well as ""response
    non-uniformity."" He also argues that the LCD found on the
    9.7-inch iPad Pro -- which DisplayMate's Raymond Soneira
    reviewed quite positively in a number of critical areas -- is
    so good that it could ""cancel any perceived advantage that
    AMOLED might offer in terms of color accuracy and
    contrast.""I respectfully disagree and wholeheartedly believe that
    Apple will eventually transition the iPhone to AMOLED displays.
    Here's why.The 9.7-inch iPad Pro display is awesome, but...There's no denying that the LCD found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro
    is truly excellent. In fact, aside from surprisingly high black
    levels (which leads to relatively low ""true"" contrast ratio
    relative to the ""infinite"" of a good AMOLED panel), the panel
    delivers wins in DisplayMate's test against the display found
    on the Galaxy S7 that a reasonable argument could be made for
    Apple's iPad Pro 9.7-inch LCD beingsuperiorto the one on the Samsung phone.There's no doubt in my mind at this point that the LCDs that
    will be featured in the iPhone 7/7 Plus will be truly excellent
    and even better than the ones found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.
    Apple may very well be able to claim smartphone display
    superiority over the rest of the industry come September using
    LCDs (and evidence suggests that Apple does significant
    proprietary display technology R&D, so it may be unique to
    Apple for a while).That being said, though the iPhone 7/7 Plus displays should
    be excellent, there is still reason for Apple to move to
    OLED.Perfect black levels, curved panels, and thinner
    displaysIt is well known that AMOLED displays allow for ""perfect"" black
    levels. This is due to the fact that the displays do not
    require a backlight and each pixel is, as Soneira puts it,
    ""individually directly powered.""In other words, when a pixel is supposed to be black, the
    pixel is simply turned off.Beyond that, though, there are other advantages. Soneira
    points out that OLEDs can be manufactured on flexible
    substrates allowing for curved displays, as seen on a handful
    of Android devices (primarily fromSamsung).Unsurprisingly, Apple isrumoredto be planning to roll out a premium iPhone with a curved
    AMOLED display in 2017.Finally, Apple is pretty bent on making its devices thinner,
    with Apple's Dan Riccio once saying in an interview that every
    tenth of a millimeter in Apple's products is ""sacred."" OLED
    displays don't require backlights, which add additional
    thickness to a device. By eliminating the backlight, Apple can
    be free to make even thinner devices without sacrificing
    battery capacity.But, wait, there's more to Hibben's argumentAs I noted early on in this column, Hibben rightfully points to
    some of the issues that current-generation AMOLED displays face
    relative to LCDs; AMOLEDs certainly aren't perfect and I
    suspect that current technical issues, coupled with cost
    considerations, are why Apple isn't likely to use such displays
    in the iPhone 7/7 Plus generation of phones.However, Apple has added many display experts to its ranks,
    with a large number of them beingexperts in OLED display technology. These highly paid experts are certainly working to develop
    next-generation display technologies, likely in conjunction
    with critical display manufacturers (LG Display, Samsung Display, Japan Display, and perhaps others).The advantages of OLEDs are clear, but so are the current
    drawbacks. It will be up to these engineers to solve these
    problems to produce unequivocally leadership smartphone
    displays for future Apple products that deliver on all of the
    advantages of OLEDs while solving the current
    challenges/drawbacks of the technology.It won't be easy, but given how important display technology
    is to Apple's key profit drivers and how large Apple's R&D
    budget has gotten, I have every confidence that these issues
    can and will be solved in due course.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Samsung Galaxy S7 Demand Reportedly Plummeting;4/18/2016;"Image credit: Samsung.According to a new note from Pacific Crest analyst Mitch
    McConnell (viaBarron's), demand for the recently releasedSamsungGalaxy S7 -- which was widely believed to be doing (relatively)
    well in the market place -- has apparently begun to fall off a
    proverbial cliff.makeArticleAd();Let's take a look at what the analyst has to say about this
    and what it might mean for Samsung's business.""Aggressive promotional activity"" led the initial surge
    in demandMcConnell says that the initially ""better-than-expected demand""
    for the S7-series of smartphones was due to ""aggressive
    promotional activity.""To give the reader a sense of this ""promotional activity,""
    note the following:Samsung offered either a Samsung Gear S2 or a Gear VR
      headset with a pre-order of the S7/S7 Edge; andAs McConnell notes, some major carriers have been doing
      ""buy one, get one"" and similar types of promotional deals to
      push the S7-series of phones.According to McConnell, recent ""sell-through"" surveys (that
    is, sales of devices to end customers) show ""weakening demand
    trends"" as well as ""rising inventories.""In fact, end customer demand is apparently now so low, just
    a little over a month after launch, that McConnell says that
    ""sell-through run rates"" are now ""tracking below those of the
    [Galaxy S6] last year.""""We note a significant spike in days of inventory, as levels
    are approaching the targeted range of six-10 days,"" writes
    McConnell.Samsung announced good results, but ...Samsung recently announced preliminary financial results for
    its most recent quarter. Revenue is expected to be
    approximately 49 trillion Korean won (~$42.47 billion) with
    operating income at 6.6 trillion Korean won (~$5.72
    billion).These figures indicate that both revenue and operating
    income are up slightly year-over-year, from 47.12 trillion
    Korean won and 5.98 trillion Korean won, respectively.Some have attributed this to the S7 being a big hit, but
    it's important to keep in mind that the year-over-year
    comparison is a bit skewed because the S7 arrived about a month
    earlier in its cycle than the S6 did. It will be interesting to
    see what Samsung's results look like next quarter, especially
    if demand was ""pulled in"" from the second quarter into the
    first.Samsung's smartphone problem isn't going awayThe Android smartphone market is becoming increasingly
    competitive, with many Android vendors offering phones that
    arguably deliver similar features to Samsung's flagships but at
    lower prices. Samsung's competition is willing to live with
    significantly lower profit margins, which means that the
    ""squeeze"" on Samsung's profit margins in the device market may
    still continue.Perhaps more positively for the company, though, is that its
    memory businesses (DRAM, NAND flash) as well as its other
    smartphone component businesses (Samsung Display, Samsung
    Foundry, etc.) may serve as more sustainable businesses over
    the longer-term than the actual smartphone business.Let's see what the full results have to sayI look forward to seeing the full results from Samsung, which
    will break down revenue and operating profit by operating
    segment. I would like to know if it was the mobile device
    business that drove this year-over-year revenue and profit
    growth or if another segment was responsible for that.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Is Intel Corporation's Mobile Strategy Falling Apart?;4/17/2016;"Last year,Intelmerged its troubled PC and mobile businesses into a single
    Client Computing group. Intel veteran Aicha Evans was tasked
    with leading the mobile unit, while Kirk Skaugen continued to
    lead the PC business. But last November, CEO Brian Krzanich
    hired Murthy Renduchintala,Qualcomm's mobile chief, as the head of the newly created Client and
    Internet of Things (IoT) Businesses and Systems Architecture
    Group -- which included chips for PCs and any devices connected
    to the Internet.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();That decision, which made Renduchintala Krzanich's second in
    command, reportedly triggered major internal conflicts. Evans
    and Skaugen both resigned in early April, leaving a power
    vacuum at the top of Intel's biggest business division. Evans
    had only held the position for less than a year, but Skaugen
    had previously been favored to become Intel's next CEO. That
    shakeup also means Intel's mobile business, which has been
    bleeding billions per year, is being left rudderless unless
    Renduchintala develops new turnaround strategies.What's next for Intel's mobile business?In the past, Intel tried to gain market share by giving
    smartphone and tablet makers steep discounts on its Atom chips,
    co-marketing deals, and financial assistance in redesigning
    logic boards. Those payments, known as ""contra revenues,""
    caused the mobile unit to post operating losses of $3.1 billion
    in 2013 and $4.2 billion in 2014.Intel stopped reporting mobile losses separately last year,
    but the company claims the unit made ""almost $1 billion"" in
    profitability improvements in 2015, indicating it still likely
    lost around $3.2 billion. After all of those losses, Intel
    finished last year with a mere 1% share of the smartphone
    processor market. Intel is trying to gradually phase out contra
    revenues and improve profitability by reducing the production
    costs of its chips. But over the past year, rumors have flown
    that Asus, one of Intel's top smartphone processor customers,
    might start using Qualcomm processors instead.Image source: Intel.Under Evans, Intel's mobile unit scored a few minor
    victories, including a design win in Xiaomi's Mi Pad 2 andpotential modem shipmentsfor the next iPhone. But Intel has been marginalized so much by
    Qualcomm and other ARM licensees that the only viable solution
    seems to be spending billions of dollars to buy tiny slivers of
    mobile market share.Following Qualcomm is the wrong playKrzanich seems to think  hiring Renduchintala, who oversaw
    much of Qualcomm's domination of the mobile chip market, would
    help Intel become more competitive in smartphones. Back in
    2014, Krzanich also hired Qualcomm's Amir Faintuch to co-manage
    its Platform Engineering Group, which designs the SoCs for
    Intel's IoT, wearable, and next-generation client and mobile
    platforms.Krzanich's efforts to hire outsiders to disrupt Intel's
    insular culture were admirable, but I think poaching executives
    from Qualcomm wasn't the right play. The problem is that
    Qualcomm has been losing market share over the past few years
    to nimbler rivals like Taiwan-basedMediaTek, which won over many OEMs with its cheaper chips. As for
    Faintuch and Renduchintala, both executives oversaw the
    development of the maligned Snapdragon 810, which experienced
    overheating issues and likely influenced key customers likeSamsungto use in-house silicon instead. Top Qualcomm executives are
    also used tobig compensation packages-- that's probably  why Intel paid $25 million to bring
    Renduchintala aboard.Following MediaTek would be the right playInstead, Intel should have poached some top execs from
    MediaTek, which has a strong record of market share gains
    without bloated compensation packages. Or better yet, Intel
    could simply buy MediaTek, as analysts have suggested for
    years, to instantly gain control of nearly 20% of  the
    smartphone processor market. MediaTek is also profitable,
    although increased R&D spending has weighed down operating
    profits in recent quarters.MediaTek currently has a market cap of around $11 billion.
    Even if Intel pays a hefty premium and buys it for $20 billion,
    it would still be smarter than losing over $3 billion per year
    to maintain a 1% market share. By integrating MediaTek's
    operations into its own, Intel could pool together R&D
    resources to cut costs, manufacture chips at lower prices with
    economies of scale, and finally stop subsidizing undeserving
    OEMs.Frustration at the topIn a leaked internal memo recently obtained byThe Oregonian'sMike Rogoway, Renduchintala declared that after numerous
    project reviews over the past three months, he noticed a clear
    trend -- "" a lack of product/customer focus in execution that
    is creating schedule and competitiveness gaps in our
    products.""Recent benchmarks certainly reveal a big performance gap
    between Intel's Atom Z350 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820, but it
    could be far too late for Intel to close that gap and catch up.
    Therefore, hiring Qualcomm's top execs simply won't save
    Intel's mobile business -- it must do something drastic, like
    buying MediaTek, or give up on the market altogether.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't

1 Critical Apple Catalyst This Analyst Overlooks;4/16/2016;"Source: AppleDespite its four other multi-billion dollar businesses, tech
    giantApplestill lives and dies by the iPhone.makeArticleAd();As a device that evolves in cycles, the ebb and flow of
    iPhone sales have a disproportionate effect of sales and profit
    growth of the world's largest public company. This dynamic
    understandably elicits its fair share of study and discussion
    among the analyst community.Recently, one well-respected research firm lowered its price
    target for Apple's shares citing reasons I'll discuss below.
    More importantly, the analysis also overlooks a coming catalyst
    for Apple shares -- the iPhone 7.The best kind of bad newsAs the headline read inThe Wall Street Journal, ""People Aren't Upgrading Smartphones as Quickly and That Is
    Bad for Apple."" The title referred to a recent note from
    sell-side research firm BTIG, whose analysis I typically find
    sophisticated and well reasoned. Last week, BTIG lowered its
    12-month price target forApple stock, but the seemingly negative headline fails to tell the entire
    storyline.What's missing is BTIG also maintained its Buy rating for
    Apple shares, and its new one-year price target for Apple stock
    of $130 still sits 19% above Apple's current stock price of
    $109.02 as of the close of trading on Monday. Read this way,
    the news certainly doesn't seem especially negative, though
    BTIG does cite a few important potential developments that
    could affect Apple in the coming months.Specifically, BTIG cites a potential lengthening of the
    iPhone upgrade cycle and the possible competitive threat ofSamsung's new Galaxy S7 flagship handset as risks that could weigh on
    Apple's financial performance. Parsing reports from the four
    main U.S. telecom operators and its own research, BTIG makes a
    strong argument that U.S. smartphone upgrade cycles are indeed
    lengthening, a trend that could adversely impact carriers and
    handset OEMs like Apple and Samsung.All told, BTIG now believes sales of smartphones by the four
    largest U.S. carriers will decline by 3.7% in 2016 before
    returning to grow 4% in 2017. Worse yet for Apple, BTIG also
    notes that its conversations with various industry players
    indicate Samsung's Galaxy S7 is also proving surprisingly
    popular. Combined, BTIG sees Apple's sales declining slightly
    in its current fiscal year. However, it seems to me that this
    analysis also overlooks one very important wild card.Source: AppleSwing factorBarring an unimaginable shift in strategy, Apple will revamp
    the form factor for the iPhone 7 later this year. Importantly,
    Apple's fiscal year runs one quarter ahead of the regular
    calendar year, meaning the holiday quarter is the first quarter
    of Apple's fiscal year. Seen this way, the sales effect of the
    iPhone 7 should appear in Apple's FY 2017, which BTIG agrees
    will return to growth for the Mac maker. However, this fails to
    account for the market's own possible attempts to anticipate
    this coming growth.Earlier this year, Ipublished a pieceexamining this specific dynamic, discussing the ""ideal"" time to
    buy Apple's shares in the face of what many analysts expected
    to be soft earnings reports early in the year for Apple. Some
    brief research uncovered that Apple's shares have historically
    outperformed the broad market by roughly 25% in the six-month
    window prior to each of Apple's past three form factor
    upgrades.Despite the small sample size, it seems the market
    anticipates the coming growth from a new iPhone cycle before it
    actually begins. This means that despite BTIG's very plausible
    projections, Apple's stock could well move before iPhone cycle
    growth manifests itself in the company's financials. As such,
    it seems the potential negative effect of the slowing upgrade
    cycle could be more than offset by investors bidding up Apple
    stock in advance of the next iPhone. Again this isn't a given
    course of action, but it certainly seems plausible given what
    we know about Apple's typical product and financial cycles.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't

Apple Just Ordered 100 Million OLED iPhone Displays;4/16/2016;"OLED displays from both Samsung (left) and LG Display
    (right), Image sources: Samsung Display, LG DisplayFor years now, the technology rumor mill has speculated as
    to if and whenApplewould begin a broader migration of its products away
    from LCD and toward OLED displays. But if recent reports from
    South Korea are any indication, the Cupertino-based tech giant
    may have just taken its biggest step yet toward that
    transition.makeArticleAd();According to leading South Korean news siteYonhap News, leading OLED producerSamsungDisplay juststruck a dealworth an estimated $2.59 billion to supply roughly 100
    million 5.5-inch OLED smartphone displays annually to Apple.
    The duration of the agreement is said to be ""at least three
    years.""Assuming the report is accurate, it marks an enormous
    expansion of Apple's use of OLED technology. Up until now,
    Apple has only employed OLED displays in its Apple Watch, while
    choosing to stick with LCD for its remaining product lines,
    including iPhone and iPad.Surprise!(?)The deal shouldn't come as a surprise. Almost exactly one year
    ago, Samsung Display raised my eyebrows byforming a 200-person teamwhose reported goal was to focusexclusivelyon Apple's display needs.What's more, this past November, the CFO of OLED specialistUniversal Display Corporation, Sidney Rosenblatt, reminded investors that Apple has been
    filing OLED patents for ""six or seven years."" And while
    Rosenblatt noted the capacity likely wouldn't be in the
    marketplace until at least 2017 to satisfy Apple's demand, he
    also asserted his belief that it'sonly a matter of time, given Apple management's past comments praising the thinner
    form factor, greater power efficiency, and superior colors and
    contrast that OLED displays enable.Universal Display arguably stands to benefit most from this
    deal. Universal Display already counts Samsung Display as its
    single-largest customer, as Samsung has long used OLED displays
    as a key technological differentiator for its popular Galaxy
    smartphones and tablets.As I wrote after Universal Display shares fell following itsweaker-than-expected quarterly reportin February, the company can primarily blame its recent under
    performance on Samsung Display's year-end inventory management,
    as well as its recent shift away from UDC's higher-margin host
    OLED materials -- which aren't protected under its
    emitter-centric patent portfolio -- in favor of its own. In
    turn, this meant a larger percentage of overall revenue came
    from UDC's lower-priced, lower-margin emitters.Then again, Universal Display's emitter business has long
    remained its primary growth opportunity. While there may be
    risk of UDC suffering margin pressure givenevenlarger-volume orders from Samsung as it works to support Apple,
    the sheer size of those orders should more than compensate for
    its narrower profitability.There may (not) be a loserShares ofLG Display-- which stood as Universal Display's second-largest customer
    last quarter behind Samsung Display -- fell nearly 6% today on
    the news, presumably based on the assumption that Samsung's
    gain came at the expense of its South Korean rival. But here
    again, this shouldn't come as a surprise considering reports
    dating as far back as last November stating Samsung had secured
    its status as the exclusive provider of OLED iPhone displays --
    that is, at least, for the initial run.Investors should also know it's not uncommon for Apple to
    hedge its bets by using multiple display suppliers. LG Display
    was initially the exclusive supplier of OLED displays for the
    Apple Watch when it was released last year -- until Apple
    diversified its sources by adding Samsung as a secondary Apple
    Watch OLED supplier this past October.What's more, in January,Focus Taiwanreported Apple wasmulling an investmentinAU Optronicsto ""transform"" it into a third-reliable source of OLED
    iPhone displays. And a full year earlier, supply-chain sources
    stated Apple had commissioned longtime suppliersFoxconnand Innolux tobuild a $2.6 billion OLED display factorywith a targeted 2017 time frame for production. While LG
    Display's supposed snub from the initial run of OLED iPhones
    may not be ideal for the company, the door remains open for it
    to play a significant supporting role in Apple's ongoing shift
    to OLED.Regardless of the specific players for now, I've said it
    before and I'll say it again: Apple's OLED iPhone appears to be
    more inevitable than ever. And the financial rewards could be
    great for investors with the foresight to buy and hold the
    companies helping to make it happen.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Wants a Connected World;4/13/2016;"While he never actually said the man's name, it was very
    clear whomFacebookCEO Mark Zuckerberg was talking about during hiskeynote addressat Facebook's F8 developers conference.In a speech that promised to walk through a road map for his

    next decade, he expected all the power of the Internet to be
    available to the whole world, not just the third of it who have
    access now. He also said that virtual/augmented reality would
    emerge as the next computing platform and that artificial
    intelligence will power ""all kinds of different services with
    better than human-level perception.""Zuckerberg gave an impassioned speech. Image source:

    voice. He said this ""mission"" goes beyond borders.""We've gone from a world of isolated communities to one
    global community, and we're all better off for it,"" he
    said.The 10-year planWhile Zuckerberg devoted a lot of his speech to the idea of
    bringing people together, he did go through his company''s
    10-year plan. He said the first problem that needs to be solved
    is that about two-thirds of the world lacks Internet access. He
    said Facebook will be working on technology such as drones,
    satellites, and laser communications systems that can bring
    more people online.The CEO also shared that his company would be committed to
    the idea of sharing anything with anyone. He defined ""anything""
    as being beyond just the photos and simple videos people share
    now on his platform. He spoke about immersive experiences and
    being able to capture moments in new ways, such as 360
    video.""We're always trying to get closer to this purest form of
    capturing an idea or an experience,"" he said.For the ""anyone"" part, he talked about how Facebook's family
    of apps, which includes What's App, Messenger, Instagram, and
    more, would develop to allow people to control how they
    communicate.""Sometimes we want to talk to just one friend. Sometimes we
    want to hang out with a few friends. Sometimes we have
    something that we want to share with all our friends, with all
    our co-workers, or with an entire community like marathon
    runners or Golden State Warriors fans,"" he explained. ""And
    sometimes we want to share something with the whole world.""Making that possible in exactly the way each person wants to
    share is part of the Facebook 10-year mission.""This is the goal,"" he said. ""Give everyone the power to
    share anything they want with anyone.""A screen shot of how Facebook sees its next 10 years. Image
    source: Facebook.He really believes in virtual realityA key component of Zuckerberg's speech was his belief that
    immersive virtual reality will be a major part of the company's
    offering within 10 years. To drive that point home, he
    presented every person in the audience with aSamsungphone and a Gear VR headset, which has technology provided by
    Faceook's Oculus brand.He explained how he thinks the emerging technology will
    change how people interact with pretty much everything.""When we get to this world,"" he said, speaking of
    virtual/augmented reality, ""is a lot of things that we think
    about as physical objects today, like a TV for displaying an
    image, will actually be a $1 app in the AR app store.""Of course, he also said that ""it's going to take a long time
    to make this work, but this the vision, this is what we're
    trying to get to over the next 10 years.""A plea for us to come togetherWhile Zuckerberg closed the show by handing out free Samsung
    gear, the overriding theme of the day was not Facebook's
    business or its partners. The message kept coming back to the
    idea of connecting people, even in the odd way that folks can
    connect with a Samsung headset strapped on.""It takes courage to choose hope over fear, to say that we
    can build something and make it better than it has ever been
    before,"" he said. ""You have to be optimistic to think that you
    can change the world ... [I]t's this hope and this optimism
    that is behind every important step forward.""Zuckerberg said he believed that problems such as curing
    diseases and solving climate change would only be solved if
    people across the world work together.""I hope that we have the courage to see that the path
    forward is to bring people together, not push people apart, to
    connect more, not less,"" he said.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Are There Any Silver Linings in BlackBerry's Soft Earnings?;4/12/2016;"If you're like most tech investors, you probably haven't
    thought aboutBlackBerryin a while.The early smartphone pioneer failed to keep pace with the
    likes ofApple,Samsung, andAlphabet, which led to spectacular declines in its market share and
    stock price.makeArticleAd();BBRYdata byYChartsThe company soldiers on with a new strategy, centered
    largely on software and services. However, shares sank earlier
    this month on yet another disappointing earnings report. Are
    there any positives for BlackBerry beyond the headline
    figures?Earnings mixed bagThe leading numbers don't inspire much confidence. Fiscal
    2016 annual sales totaled $2.2 billion, down approximately 33%
    from the $3.3 billion the company reported in fiscal 2015.
    Quarterly revenue contracted at a more gradual pace, falling
    30% from $660 million in the same quarter last year to $464
    million.BlackBerry continued its string of net losses -- $238
    million for its fiscal Q4 and $208 million for the full fiscal
    year. Excluding certain charges, such as costs associated with
    its restructuring program, BlackBerry says its Q4 net loss
    would have been closer to $18 million. Neither figure reads
    well. But let's delve one level deeper.Segment analysisDigging further into recent filings offers a little more
    nuance. Here's how BlackBerry's revenue broke down among its
    three reporting segments over its past four quarters:MetricQ4 2016Q3 2016Q2 2016Q1 2016Total non-GAAP revenue$487$557$491$658Software and services$156$162$74$138Service access fees$141$173$211$250Hardware$190$223$201$263Source: BlackBerry investor relations. Figures in
    millions.The key area to focus on is BlackBerry's Software and
    Services segment, which stands alone in representing the
    company's future path toward profitability. Though Software and
    Services revenue didn't grow relative to the fiscal third
    quarter, it remained essentially flat amid sharp sales
    contractions in the other two divisions.What's more, the general trend has been largely positive
    over the past four quarters, ever since BlackBerry instituted
    its three-segment reporting structure. For the entire fiscal
    year, the company surpassed its reported internal goal of
    generating $500 million in Software amd Services revenue.Too tough to callThe challenge in analyzing BlackBerry is that it's really two
    companies in one. You have the legacy handset business and
    service access fees (SAFs), both of which figure to continue to
    decline.Source: BlackBerry.This quarter again proved that BlackBerry's handset division
    is effectively done. The company launched its Priv smartphone,
    the first BlackBerry device to run on Alphabet's Android mobile
    OS, to little fanfare. Some had wondered whether BlackBerry's
    design might reattract users who had defected from the platform
    because of its increasingly thin selection of apps. However,
    not even Alphabet's smartphone software could help BlackBerry's
    handset prospects. The company said shipments of smartphones
    declined from 700,000 in the third quarter to 600,000 in during
    its recent report. For context, Apple sold 74.8 million iPhone
    in Q4 of calendar 2015, and Samsung sold 85.6 million. Stick a
    fork in BlackBerry's handset division.Similarly, the SAF division should continue to fade in the
    coming years. BlackBerry historically charged SAFs to access
    the company's secure services. However, with usage of older
    BlackBerry operating systems declining and the rise of new
    secure alternatives, such as Apple's iMessage and others, fewer
    and fewer reasons exist for customers to continue to pay SAFs.
    In its public filings, BlackBerry routinely signals this
    downward trend as likely to continue.We can all agree the future isn't rosy for either division,
    which leaves Software and Services as the lone potential bright
    spot on which BlackBerry can stake its future.And it does offer plenty of potential upside. One particular
    area of interest is BlackBerry's QNX software division, which
    figures to compete quite nicely against Apple and Alphabet in
    the software that will power future autonomous vehicles. Yet
    not even Software and Services is growing like a weed. It's not
    displaying the kind of growth that would prove its success is
    highly likely.Such is the head-scratching scenario at BlackBerry. Down but
    not out, the company makes it too hard to tell whether its
    future is bankable.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't

4 Things to Know About Amazon.com Inc's Upcoming Kindle Oasis;4/12/2016;"At some point this week, e-commerce giantAmazon.comis widely expected to unveil the latest generation of its
    hugely popular Kindle e-reader: the Kindle Oasis.As a company with a famous penchant for secrecy, the exact
    release date isn't clear at this point. However, one fairly
    credible source, Amazon's CEO, tweeted last week that the
    device should make its debut in the coming days:Heads up readers - all-new, top of the line Kindle almost
    ready. 8th generation. Details next week.makeArticleAd();- Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)April 4, 2016And then aproduct leakon the Chinese e-commerce site Tmall made its way to the
    media, shedding light on at least some of the new features that
    will find their way into Amazon's latest e-reader. So, before
    it hits the proverbial shelves, let's quickly review some of
    the most interesting features that, according to a
    since-removed Tmall page, will be in what's going to be called
    the Amazon Kindle Oasis.Prominent side bezelJudging from the image leaks, the Kindle Oasis will
    dramatically shift the screen to one side of the device's body,
    unlike the centered screen of the current Kindle Voyage. The
    images also clearly show the new, larger side bezel will come
    with three long, rectangular navigation sensors, which also
    implies the device will come in both right-handed and
    left-handed versions. Either way, making one bezel thicker than
    the other should, in theory, make one-handed reading far
    simpler for Kindle users. Commuters rejoice!It keeps on going, and going, and going...The Kindle Oasis promises to break fresh ground in terms of its
    extended battery life thanks to its unusual design and new
    charging cover. Amazon appears to have shifted a significant
    portion of the Oasis' battery storage into the thicker side
    bezel. What's more, when paired with the Amazon-branded
    charging case the company plans to debut, the Kindle Oasis is
    rumored to enjoy an astounding standby battery life of up to 20
    months.Amazon Kindle Voyage. Image source: Amazon.It isn't exactly clear what kind of battery life the Kindle
    Oasis will sport as a stand-alone product, though. However,
    Amazon has reportedly engineered the charging case and Kindle
    Oasis to interact in a way such that they both help recharge
    one another. Smartly, the Kindle Oasis will also use the
    charging case's battery first whenever the two devices are
    unplugged together in order to maximize the device's usage
    time.Not waterproofIn what appears to be the first downside of the device, any
    interested users will want to enjoy their forthcoming Kindles
    at a safe distance from the pool or the beach this summer.
    Alas, the waterproofing we've seen included in other popular
    consumer electronics likeSamsung's Galaxy S7 will reportedly not appear in Amazon's Kindle
    Oasis. This has apparently been a longtime request among Kindle
    enthusiasts. Maybe next year...Lighter, brighterAccording to the Chinese-to-English translation, Amazon's
    latest Kindle will weigh 131 grams, or 0.29 pounds, which sits
    appreciably lower than the Kindle Paperwhite's 205 grams or
    Kindle Voyage's 180 grams. Given the tiered battery
    construction mentioned above, the Kindle's thinness
    dramatically differs across the device. At its skinniest, the
    device will reportedly measure 3.4 millimeters, and that will
    increase to 8.5 millimeters at its thickest point. Looking to
    its screen specs, the Oasis' screen is expected to feature the
    same 300 ppi definition as the Kindle Voyage. However, Amazon
    has reportedly packed 60% more LEDs into the screen, which
    should provide a marked improvement over its predecessor in
    terms of the clarity and sharpness of its text.Hurry up and waitOne thing that the purported leak didn't cover was how much the
    Kindle Oasis will cost. For context, the current Kindle
    Paperwhite retails for $119.99, and the Kindle Voyage, whose
    features the Oasis more closely resembles, sells for $199.99.
    Again, the exact timing on this week's launch isn't exactly
    clear. When the news does eventually break, make sure to check
    back with us for further analysis of the upcoming eighth
    generation of Amazon's hugely popular e-reader.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

iPhone SE Reviews: Should Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be Worried?;4/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsIn March,Apple Inc.(AAPL) broke from tradition and introduced the iPhone SE, diverting
  from its traditional once-a-year iPhone event in September. From
  an investor's perspective, I applauded the move, which I believed
  wouldsoak up some latent demandfor customers wanting smaller iPhones. Before the release of the
  SE, the last time a 4-inch model debuted was in 2013 with the
  iPhone 5s.On the flipside, it was apparent from the jump that the smaller
  iPhone wouldn't be revolutionary by any stretch of the
  imagination, which reinforces a concern many AAPL stock owners
  have right now: Is the innovative Apple of yesteryear dead and
  gone?makeArticleAd();The jury's out on that question, as far as I'm concerned. But
  as far as Apple's latest smartphone is concerned, the jury is
  very much in.Let's take a look at some iPhone SE reviews from some of
  the top consumer tech outlets out there, and see if it gives
  Apple investors reason to squirm … or applaud.iPhone SE Reviews: Generally Favorable for AAPLHere's an ultra-quick outlet-by-outlet summary of the iPhone
  SE reviews … which were (spoiler alert) overwhelmingly positive.
  Score a win for AAPL, as far as I'm concerned.Apple Inc.: iPhone SE Review (AAPL)EngadgetEngadgetgives the iPhone SE an 89 out of 100 rating. Remember
  the brief pros and cons that it lists, which we'll see
  popping up quite a bit throughout:Pros: Performance, battery life, starting price of ""just""
    $399.Cons: Screen is too small for some users, outdated front
    camera and Touch ID sensor and the base model has just 16GB of
    storage.MacworldMacworldgave a glowing review of the iPhone SE. It makes ""barely any
  compromises, compared to the larger, more expensive iPhone
  6s.""While ""Nothing about this phone feels slow or sluggish,""
  isn't a ringing endorsement for AAPL, the 4.5 out of 5 stars
  the new iPhone received is. One of the biggest upgrades from the
  old iPhone 5s - the body of which is mimicked by the iPhone SE -
  is the Apple Pay compatibility. As for tradeoffs?Macworldcites the absence of 3D Touch as the most notable.The VergeAnd what doesThe Vergehave to say about Apple's latest iteration of its hit
  product?""It's a shiny little fishing lure for first-time iPhone buyers
  or people who feel overdue for an upgrade. Those people might be
  tempted by the many good Android phones that can be had for less
  than $400, and Apple is taking them on more directly than it ever
  has before.""Hopefully,The Vergeis right about that lower price point giving AAPL another tool to
  use againstAlphabet Inc's (GOOG,GOOGL) Android OS.Since the iPhone SE is basically just an iPhone 6s stuffed in
  the body of an iPhone 5s, how is the SE different from each of
  its predecessors?""The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have better front-facing cameras,
  but the iPhone SE is stuck with a 1.2-megapixel sensor.""Not so flattering. However, the differentiation from the
  iPhone 5sis:""Even though they're the exact same size, the iPhone SE can
  get up to 50 percent better battery life than the iPhone 5s.""Overall grade? 8.7 out of 10.WiredTheWiredreview of the iPhone SE had more than a few notable quotes, but
  here are two of the most insightful ones:""It's like Apple took all of Dwayne Johnson's strength and
  muscle and charisma and stuffed it into the 5-foot-5 frame of
  Daniel Radcliffe.""Shots fired, Harry Potter! Quote number two?""The downgrade I noticed most by far was the slower Touch ID
  fingerprint reader, which is now just slow enough that I was
  forever thinking it didn't work and typing my passcode a
  quarter-second before it kicked in.""That said, at the end of the day the iPhone SE only walked
  away with a 7 out of 10 rating. Pretty good, but still the least
  flattering of the iPhone SE reviews accumulated here.7 Deep Value Stocks to Buy SoonOf course, no summary of iPhone reviews would be complete
  withoutCNET's opinion, and the techies over there were rabid fans, giving
  the iPhone SE an 8.5 out of 10 rating (or four out of five
  stars).So, all in all, pretty solid reviews across the board.While most reviews cautioned readers that the $399 beginning
  price is a bit misleading - 16GB of storage doesn't go so far
  nowadays - most also concluded that the speedy little smartphone
  was a nice deal for the money.Given the positive reception, I still think the decision to
  combine modern-day features with an old-school form
  factor should be good for AAPL stock, too.As of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in

GE Appliance: A Preferred Brand for Most US Homebuilders;4/12/2016;"With the gradual revival of the U.S. homebuilding industry, GE
Appliance, an operating unit ofGeneral Electric CompanyGE, has emerged as the preferred brand among the majority of the
homebuilders. About 10 of the leading 15 U.S. homebuilders have
reportedly chosen GE Appliance for their existing and upcoming
projects, making it an undisputed leader in the country's kitchen
appliance market.makeArticleAd();The GE Appliance business sells and services major home appliances
including refrigerators, freezers, electric and gas ranges, cook
tops, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, microwave ovens,
room air conditioners, and residential water systems under the GE
Monogram, GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands.To further strengthen its market presence, GE Appliance intends to
invest $2 billion to expand its product portfolio and about 20 new
products are slated for launch in 2016 itself.However, GE Appliance is exclusively focused on the U.S. markets,
thereby lacking the global scale to compete with other leading
electronics manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.SSNLFand LG Electronics Inc. This leads to flatter revenues and
contracted margins. Consequently, General Electric decided to
divest the business in early 2016 to the Chinese multinational
consumer electronics manufacturer, Haier Group. The transaction is
expected to be complete in the near future and GE Appliance, along
with Haier, is expected to continue its legacy of delivering
optimal products for customers.In addition to unlocking incremental value by allocating more
resources to high-growth businesses, the divesture was in tune with
General Electric's corporate strategy to focus on the core
industrial businesses.General Electric is currently engaged in massive restructuring
initiatives to create a simpler and nimbler firm. From a classic
conglomerate with diversified business interests in financial
services, media, industrial and technology-based operations, the
company is pruning its operating portfolio to concentrate on core
manufacturing businesses with a digital edge.Since Apr 2015, GE Capital has inked sale agreements worth
approximately $161 billion, of which it has completed deals worth
$138 billion. The company intends to sell approximately $200
billion of GE Capital assets globally by the end of 2016. The
transactions are in conformity with the corporate strategy of
building a manufacturing-based entity with emphasis on big-ticket
items such as aviation engines, drilling machines, generators,
medical equipment and scanners. With these restructuring
initiatives, General Electric expects operating earnings from the
industrial business to comprise over 90% of its total operating
earnings by 2018, up from 58% in 2014.The corporate restructuring activities have positioned General
Electric to probably become the first company to drop its
too-big-to-fail label. We remain impressed with the continued
efforts of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to sustain its growth
momentum. A couple of better-ranked stocks in the industry include

Analyst: Apple Inc. Watch Shipments to Plunge 25% in 2016;4/12/2016;"Image credit: Apple.Yet anotherAppleproduct category is expected to face a year-over-year decline
    in 2016. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via
    MacRumors), Apple Watch shipments worked out to 10.6 million
    units during 2015 (during which it was available for only eight
    months). For all of 2016, shipments are expected to drop to
    just 7.5 million units.makeArticleAd();This prediction is largely in-line with areportfrom DigiTimes last month claiming that Apple Watch sales have
    been (relatively) tepid and that the category is expected to
    decline year-over-year in 2016.Interestingly, according to Kuo, Apple plans to launch the
    second generation Apple Watch in the fall of 2016 rather than
    at WWDC in June aspredictedby Drexel Hamilton analyst, Brian White. Perhaps Apple would be
    on track to see better year-over-year comparisons if it were to
    release the refreshed device sooner?Speaking of a refreshed device ...White previously claimed that Apple's next generation Apple
    Watch could be anywhere from 20% to 40% thinner than the first
    generation model. However, Kuo, whose track record in nailing
    product-level features/specification is unmatched, believes
    that the new Apple Watch will generally bring internal
    improvements rather than a significant change to the industrial
    design.That, Kuo indicates, is likely to change with the 2017
    model, which is expected to bring a reworked industrial
    design.Can an internal spec bump be enough?For the 2016 Apple Watch, I am expecting a significant
    improvement in performance and internal specifications.
    Although such ""spec bumps"" alone don't seem to be enough to
    drive iPhone sales growth (as evidenced by the lackluster sales
    of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus), marketed correctly, they could help
    the Apple Watch.Unlike the iPhone, which has been ""fast"" for quite some
    time, the Apple Watch is still in its infancy in terms of both
    features and performance. This means that application
    developers are fairly limited in what they are able to
    accomplish with the current Apple Watch, which in turn limits
    the appeal of the device to consumers.Once Apple starts endowing the Apple Watch with more serious
    compute power and, perhaps, improves the connectivity features
    of the device to reduce/eliminate the reliance on the iPhone,
    sales could return to a growth track.Maybe the Apple Watch 2 will perform better than Kuo, the
    supply chain vendors, and perhaps even Apple itself expect?
    Time will tell.Maybe the market research firms should tone down their
    smartwatch predictionsWhenever a new product category sprouts, the well-known market
    research firms (IDC, Gartner, etc.) tend to put out multi-year
    predictions for industry unit growth for said product category.
    Furthermore, with fairly limited sales data, these firms even
    go so far as to predict unit growth dataper operating system.IDC, for example, predicted in a recentreportthat Apple Watch sales would come in at 14 million units in
    2016 and grow at a 22% compounded annual growth rate through
    2020. There are similar predictions for other operating systems
    such as Android, Android Wear, Tizen, RTOS, and Pebble OS.Given that Apple Watch sales are expected todeclinethis year, and given that the other smartwatch makers aren't
    even on the radar (Samsunghas resorted to giving away its Galaxy Gear smartwatches with
    smartphone pre-orders), these hyper-bullish industry
    predictions will likely prove far too optimistic and that
    investors should not rely on them in making investment
    decisions.3 companies poised to explode when cable

GoPro Inc Stock: GPRO Is a Castle Without a Moat;4/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsLately,GoPro Inc(GRPO) shareholders have experienced something close to an action
  sport. But over the past month or so, things have settled down a
  bit and the company has caught a nice wave of buying: GoPro stock
  is up 21% since early February. However, this could be
  just a fake-out.makeArticleAd();The fact is there are still serious perils for GoPro
  stock.First of all, it's important to realize that the sales have
  been in free-fall. In thelatest quarter, revenues plunged by 31% to $436.6 million, and the loss came to
  $34.5 million or 25 cents per share. Note: This was for the
  all-important holiday season!But the problems do not appear to be a one-time event. For the
  current quarter, GPRO expects revenues of $160 million to $180
  million, well below the analysts' consensus of $298 million.GPRO has taken several actions to get some level of stability.
  For example, the company recently cut costs by reducing 7%
  reduction of its workforce. It also slashed prices on its
  latest devices to clear inventory. Finally, GoProbolstered its software capabilities, spending $105 million for Stupeflix and Vemory (video
  editing has been an Achilles' heel
  for GRPO).7 Dividend Stocks That Have Paid Investors
      Since the 19th CenturyBut none of this may matter much for GoPro stock as the
  company still faces fierce headwinds. If anything, the GoPro
  product category may be mostly a narrow niche.Questionable Longevity for GoPro StockLet's face it, how many people really need a camera attached
  to their surfboard or helmet? And besides, for those who do, is
  there really a need for frequent upgrades?Lately, it seems that the answers are not very
  encouraging.Besides, even if the market potential is larger, there
  could still be bad news for GoPro shareholders. The reason is
  that, well, the company may violate one of Warren Buffet's
  timeless principles - that is, a company needs a moat. This
  is a sustainable competitive advantage that is incredibly tough
  for rivals to crack.According to Buffett:""When we see a moat that's tenuous in any way - it's just too
  risky. We don't know how to evaluate that. And, therefore, we
  leave it alone. We think that all of our businesses - or
  virtually all of our businesses - have pretty darned good moats.
  And we think the managers are widening them.""In the case of GPRO, the moat is getting tenuous. For example,
  the market is awash with offerings from major operators
  likeCanon Inc(ADR)(CAJ),Nikon Corp (ADR)(NINOY),Samsung(SSNLF) andSony Corp (ADR)(SNE). Then there is buzz that others may enter the market likeApple Inc.(AAPL) and evenUnder Armour Inc(UA).Given all this activity, the market is vulnerable to pricing
  pressures. After all, take a look at Activeon, which has a
  top-notch GPRO alternative that is on sale for amere $91. The product currently fetches an impressive 4.4 star rating onAmazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) product page.Meanwhile, there are plenty of fast-charging startups making a
  play for GoPro, such as Fusar and 360Fly. These companies arepushing innovationwith their smart editing, virtual reality connections and
  safety functions (for example, if you crash your bike, there will
  be an emergency call).Bottom Line on GoPro StockIt will take some time to get a sense of whether GPRO can make
  a turnaround.Keep in mind that the next major launch of the core product -
  the GoPro Hero 5 - will likely not hit the marketuntil October. A few months before this, there will also likely be the release
  of the Karma quadcopter drone product.So far, the details are sketchy. But investors in GoPro stock
  should be wary. The last major product launch - for the
  Hero4 Session - was a disaster. The product simply had few
  features that compelled customers to pull out their wallets.Oh, and what about the VR product? This may also be
  problematic.According to areportfrom Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, the technology already
  appears to be ""obsolete.""No doubt, as seen with other former darlings in the devices
  space - likeNokia Corp (ADR)(NOK) andBlackBerry Ltd(BBRY) - it can be extremely tough to recover.The competition can get overwhelming and pricing pressures can
  wreak havoc on margins. Unfortunately, it looks like this
  playbook is also becoming a stark reality for GoPro stock as
  well.Tom Taulli runs theInvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook. He is also the author ofHigh-Profit IPO

The LG G5 Is the Most Revolutionary Smartphone in Years;4/9/2016;"LG's latest flagship smartphone, the G5, went on sale last week.
    At first glance, it appears to be a traditional, high-end
    Android flagship. But it's packing a feature its competitors
    can't offer. Indeed, the G5 may legitimately be the most
    revolutionary new smartphone in years.It's a bit of a gamble on LG's part, but if it succeeds, it
    should provide a compelling alternative toSamsung's Galaxy series andApple's iPhones.LG G5 in pink. Source: LGmakeArticleAd();The first modular smartphone from a major handset
    makerSpecs wise, the G5 is almost indistinguishable from a dozen
    other expensive Android phones. It has a high-resolution,
    5.3-inch screen; a Snapdragon 820 processor; and 4GB of RAM. It
    has a fingerprint scanner, which has become increasingly
    ordinary in recent years, a USB Type-C connection, a 2,800 mAh
    battery, and a body made of metal. It's priced about the same
    as Samsung's competing Galaxy S7 -- a comparison which isn't
    favorable for LG. In addition to offering specs as good or
    better on virtually every front, Samsung's phone is waterproof
    and supports wireless charging. The G5 offers neither.Where LG sets the G5 apart is with a unique feature never
    before seen on a phone from a major handset maker. The G5's
    lower bezel slides off, and can be replaced with a variety of
    alternative couplings. LG refers to these as ""friends,"" and
    they can be used to add additional functionality. So far, LG
    has announced two: the Cam Plus and the Hi-Fi Plus with B&O
    Play. The former adds a dedicated shutter button, zoom dial,
    and hand grip, as well as a large battery -- perfect for long
    photo sessions. The later offers a headphone amp and support
    for high-fidelity audio, leveraging the well-respected Bang
    & Olufsen brand to attract the interest of audiophiles.The possibilities seem endless. New friends could add
    support for wireless charging, better speakers, and an even
    bigger camera. Business users could strap on a hardware
    keyboard; gamers could attach a dedicated controller. The
    company could offer a suite of different modules that make the
    phone far more customizable than any of its competitors --
    users could tailor the G5 to their needs and their current
    location.Of course, LG has yet to announce any additional modules, or
    even definitively confirm that they are coming. When it comes
    to supporting its innovations, the company's recent track
    record is spotty at best. Last year's LG V10 sported a second
    display in addition to its main panel. It was an interesting
    idea, both innovative and unique, but it appears LG has already
    moved on, as the G5 doesn't offer it.LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play offers audiophiles a more
    premium listening experience. Source: LGRecent strugglesLG's smartphone business has struggled in recent years. Samsung
    and Apple have dominated the smartphone market since 2011, but
    there was a time when LG appeared to be emerging as a
    legitimate rival. In 2013, the company shipped 47.7 million
    smartphones, according to IDC, the fourth-most of any firm. But
    then, in 2014, it slipped to fifth place. Last year, it fell
    out of the top five altogether.Samsung and Apple have both experienced shipment growth
    since then, but the primary culprit for LG's displacement is
    its rising Chinese competition. Xiaomi, and in particular
    Huawei, have enjoyed much stronger growth in recent years,
    relegating LG to a second-rate handset-maker.LG's brand has remained strong in some markets. In the U.S.,
    where Xiaomi and Huawei are almost nonexistent, LG is still the
    third-largest seller of smartphones. In January, 9.6% of
    smartphone owners used LG-made handsets, according tocomScore. Apple's share stood at 43.6%, and Samsung's at 28.5%. When
    LG's 2015 flagship, the G4, went on sale last year, Kantar
    Worldpanel noted an uptick in demand as LG captured more
    first-time smartphone buyers and doubled its share of the U.S.
    smartphone market.Still, with its global share slipping, LG has to be more
    aggressive to drive interest in its phones. The G5's system of
    modular, interchangeable parts appears to hold a great deal of
    promise. But it may not interest buyers if the company doesn't
    see it through to its full potential.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

This Tablet Market Trend Could be Fantastic for Microsoft;4/9/2016;"Windows 10 logo. Source: MicrosoftThe tablet market just isn't what it used to be. Tablet
    shipments fell in the fourth quarter last year, slipping 13.7%
    on an annual basis, while for all of 2015 tablet shipments
    declined 10.1%. But not all tablets experienced disappointing
    sales. In fact, demand for one particular type of tablet rose
    even as other tablets struggled.According to research firm IDC, the demand for detachable
    tablets more than doubled in the fourth quarter last year.
    These tablets, which notably includeApple's iPad Pro andMicrosoft's Surface Pro, differ from their traditional, simple slate
    counterparts, as they're intended to be used in conjunction
    with a keyboard.makeArticleAd();IDC believes this trend will continue in the months and
    years ahead. The firm projects that shipments of these devices
    will roughly quadruple over the next four years, and that by
    2020, they will represent a sizable chunk of the broader tablet
    market. IDC believes this trend will mostly benefit Microsoft,
    as its Windows 10 operating system is uniquely positioned to
    take advantage of the form factor.About 35 million Windows 10 tablets in 2020There were 16.6 million detachable tablets shipped globally
    last year. If IDC's projections prove accurate, there will be
    63.8 million shipped in 2020. About half of them (54.5%) will
    be powered by Microsoft's Windows. A little under one-quarter
    (22.4%) will be iPad Pros. The remaining portion (23.1%) will
    sport the Android operating system fromAlphabet's  Google.This is roughly unchanged from IDC's 2016 projections, which
    are likely to be considerably more accurate. Still, it would
    mean that Apple lost modest share to Google's Android, while
    Microsoft remained in control of the market as it expanded. The
    overall tablet market is expected to contract to 195 million
    units in 2016, and then experience only single-digit gains in
    the years ahead. Detachable tablets, then, could represent more
    than a quarter of all tablet sales by the end of the
    decade.Factors that spoil IDC's projectionsNevertheless,as I've pointed out in the past, IDC has a poor track record when it comes to projecting
    operating system dominance. The company failed to adequately
    anticipate the rise of Google's Android and Apple's iOS in the
    smartphone market, and placed far too much faith in Microsoft's
    ability to adequately respond.Despite openly mocking the Surface for years, Apple now
    appears to be placing increasing emphasis on its line of
    detachable iPads. When the company introduced the 9.7-inch iPad
    Pro earlier this month, it explicitly labeled the device the
    ""ultimate PC replacement"", and touted it as an alternative to
    the 600 million Windows PCs in use today that are at least
    five-years old. Obviously, Apple hasn't disclosed its future
    plans for the segment, but there's much it could to improve the
    iPad Pro, and it undoubtedly will in the years to come.Google's emphasis on Android detachables has been virtually
    nonexistent, with the lone exception of its own Pixel C. The
    Android operating system lacks the multitasking features
    necessary to make such devices truly attractive. Fortunately,
    they appear to be coming later this year. Android N, the next
    version of Google's operating system,will introduce supportfor running two apps simultaneously, and it could spark a wave
    of competitive Android detachables.Samsung goes with WindowsBut Microsoft still holds the upper hand in the segment.
    Windows 10, with its support for multiple methods of input and
    automatic interface switching, is specifically designed for
    detachable tablets, unlike iOS and Android, which remain
    heavily focused on touch input. Last month, Samsunglaunched its answer to the iPad Pro, the Galaxy TabPro S. Previously, Samsung had used Android for
    all of its Galaxy devices -- but with the TabPro S, it made an
    exception, opting instead for Microsoft's Windows 10.If the market for detachables does accelerate in the years
    ahead, it should help keep the Windows operating system
    relevant. Microsoft isn't as dependent on Windows as it once
    was, but it still makes up a large portion of its business.
    Last quarter, its More Personal Computing segment (which is
    largely composed of Windows-related revenue) generated almost
    half of its revenue.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Samsung Galaxy S7 Is Doing What Apple Can No Longer Do;4/8/2016;"Samsung's Gear VR headset may be the reason for strong
    Galaxy S7 growth. Source: Samsung.Good news forSamsungand Android fans. The company's new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7
    Edge is a hit. The company recently pre-announced first-quarter
    earnings, and the results are better than anticipated. Samsung
    guided to $5.7 billion versus analyst expectations of $4.8
    billion in operating income. Samsung also exceeded top-line
    expectations by guiding for $56.4 billion in revenue, greater
    than the $56.1 billion analyst consensus.makeArticleAd();For investors in the United States, Samsung's consolidated
    earnings report is of little direct value. The company does
    list shares on the Gray Markets, the stock symbol above, but
    the investment is plagued by high bid-ask spreads, and low
    liquidity.However, if you're an investor inAppleeither directly or through mutual funds or ETFs, following
    Samsung -- especially the company's mobile division -- will
    better help you evaluate the entire high-end smartphone
    landscape. It's well established that Samsung is the biggest
    competitor to Apple in the high-end smartphone market, and
    Apple's iPhone line is highly important to the company as an
    investment. In a slowing smartphone scenario, market share and
    competitor performance become inherently more important.What smartphone growth slowdown?It seems Samsung has a strong iPhone competitor in the newest
    Galaxy S7 line. According to early estimates, the
    current-generation unit shipped 9 million units in its first
    month, triple that of the prior-gen Galaxy S6,Bloombergreports. Both units employ a similar form factor, but Samsung's newest
    version reintroduced popular features left off the Galaxy S6,
    including the microSD slot and waterproof design.Additionally, Samsung sweetened the pot bybundling its new virtual-reality Gear
    headsetwith Galaxy S7 preorders. As a result of strong Galaxy S7
    sales,Bloombergestimates Samsung's heavily watched mobile division increased
    operating income 19% in the quarter.Apple has been working on a VR headset on its own. Source:
      Patently Apple.It would benefit Apple to understand how Samsung was able to
    grow its unit shipments. Waterproof design and the microSD slot
    were included in both the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5 iterations.
    That leaves the virtual-reality bundling as the biggest
    variable.If Samsung is able to triple high-end sales against the
    backdrop of a smartphone market that is only expecting togrow 7% on a year-on-year basis, it would behoove Apple, Samsung's biggest competitor, to find
    out how the South Korean electronics conglomerate accomplished
    this growth. If VR is that big of a game changer, Apple should
    look to add this functionality to its next-gen iPhone.It's hard to grow once you're AppleTo be fair to Apple, it's slightly disingenuous to compare
    Samsung's first-month total of 9 million to Apple's iPhone
    sales figures. For a comparison, Apple sold 13 million of the
    iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus unitsin the first three days of availability.Overall, Apple sold 74.8 million units in the seasonally heavy
    first fiscal quarter.Unfortunately, this huge figure was flat on a year-on-year
    basis, and has fueled concerns that Apple is no longer able to
    grow its top line at the rapid clip investors have become
    accustomed to. The company will certainly not report shipping
    three times the number of smartphones it shipped last year
    anytime in the immediate future.During the first-quarter conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook
    predicted a year-on-year iPhone unit sales decrease in the
    second quarter. The company has been big on growing its market
    share by stealing market share from what Cook refers to as
    ""Android Switchers.""Samsung's surprising sales growth may reverse that trend and
    present further risks to iPhone sales. Don't look for Apple to
    recreate Samsung's amazing growth when it reports later this
    month, but it does show there's still demand for high-quality
    devices.The stupid-simple way to score a 22% dividendThere's nothing better than cold, hard cash. That's why the

Apple Has a Major New Obstacle to Overcome in India;4/8/2016;"Source: AppleWhen you're already the largest company in the world, where
    do you go from there?makeArticleAd();Such is the literal and figurative embarrassment of riches
    facing tech giantAppleand its shareholders. The downside of being so successful is
    that it makes further expanding its business increasingly
    difficult.In keeping with its leviathan status, Apple has
    understandably chosen to pursue opportunities of increased
    scale, both in terms of its current business and its targeting
    of future potential markets. However, continuing to grow its
    iPhone installed base certainly won't be a walk in the park, as
    one recent story about its experiences in India further
    demonstrates.News of mounting oppositionAccording to recent reporting fromBloomberg, the company with the largest market cap in the world
    appears increasingly intent on deepening its presence in the
    world's second-most populous nation, but is facing mounting
    opposition there. Per the article, a consortium of Indian
    electronics manufacturers recently established a lobbying arm,
    the Mobile and Communications Council, with the goal of swaying
    public and government opinion against Apple's maneuvers to more
    meaningfully enter the country.The electronics industry opposition appears intent on
    framing the argument in a way that casts Apple's efforts as
    running directly counter to the goals of Prime Minister
    Narendra Modi's Make In India campaign, which is promoting
    domestic manufacturing growth. In doing so, the anti-Apple
    campaign has employed some fairly acrimonious rhetoric.
    According to Sudhir Hasija, the chairman of local telecom 
    Karbonn Mobiles, ""Make in India could turn into Dump in
    India... Even if the refurbished iPhones are priced a bit more
    than 10,000 rupees [~$150], that will hurt our sales because
    Indians may choose Apple for its snob value.""This level of vehemence from domestic smartphone makers
    shouldn't be particularly surprising. The Indian smartphone
    market remains relatively fragmented, with only South Korean
    smartphone giantSamsungand domestic supplierMicromaxcontrolling market shares of more than 10%. Apple only
    accounted for about 2% of the Indian smartphone market
    according to Counterpoint Research, a situation it actively
    hopes to change in coming months.Source: AppleDeepening tiesToday, Apple is legally allowed to sell its products in India
    only via distribution partnerships withdomestic third-party retailersor as store-within-a-store concepts inside larger retailers.
    That's likely to change. Apple has reportedly reapplied with
    the Indian government to gain full legal access to import its
    products into the country, a move that could open the floodgate
    for Apple's presence in the world's largest democracy. Apple is
    reportedly likely to receive import approval from the Indian
    government, though when that might happen remains unclear.The initial data suggests Apple could enjoy considerable
    upside in India. On its first-quarter fiscal 2016 conference
    call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that Apple sales in India
    grew an impressive 76% year-over-year.  Though its
    footprint in China is far larger than its footprint in India,
    Apple's sales in China increased only 14% during the same
    period . Apple's recent product moves appear aimed at
    positioning the firm to compete in emerging markets like India,
    where lower-priced smartphones are the norm.At its spring product launch event last month, Apple debuted
    its smaller 4-inch iPhone SE, whose introductory price of $399
    is well below the $649 base price of the iPhone 6s.
    Additionally, Apple's shift toward installment plans, which
    include annual handset upgrades, also looks likely to create a
    glut of used iPhones that Apple could resell in markets like
    India, where the majority of the smartphones sell for less than
    $150.India has already eclipsed America to become the world's
    second-largest smartphone market , and that market will
    likely enjoy years of continued expansion. So as Apple growth
    in China appears likely to moderate, Apple's India plans simply
    seem like good business.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Samsung Contact Lens Would Leapfrog Google Glass, Obliterate Privacy;4/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you thoughtAlphabet Inc's(GOOG,GOOGL) Google Glass was invasive, you're not going to be happy about the
patent application filed bySamsung(SSNLF). It offers a similar augmented reality experience to Google Glass
- an overlay display, camera and Wi-Fi - but instead of clunky
headgear, Samsung wants to miniaturize all this technology and
embed it in a contact lens.Source: GoogleNo giveaway high-tech eyeglasses or blinking red light, the
Samsung contact lens would be a privacy nightmare. And possibly
just what augmented reality needs to get off the ground, if and
when the technology arrives to support the idea.makeArticleAd();Samsung's patent is several years old and consists of 29 pages
in Korean - which is probably why news of it didn't surface until a
few days ago whenSamMobilepublished the scoop.The patent is for a smart contact lens equipped with a camera,
display, an antenna and sensors. The antenna would wirelessly
connect to a smartphone, which would provide the brains of the
operation rather than the lenses operating independently.The OLED display would project images directly on the wearer's
eye, a method the patent application suggests would offer a much
higher image quality than Google Glass is capable of. The sensors
would be used to detect where a person was looking - the patent
hints at the lens using that data to display relevant information
on an overlay.Samsung Contact Lens Isn't Science FictionThe sensors would also be used in conjunction with that camera
in what is likely to be the most controversial feature of the
Samsung contact lens (at least if the public reaction to Google
Glass is any indicator): being able to snap photos and presumably
shoot video, with the blink of an eye.Smartwatches, Google Glass on MPAA Hit ListIf embedding this kind of technology in something as tiny as a
contact lens sounds like science fiction, it's not.Google has had asmart contact lens projecton-the-go since 2014. It's tackling a different mission than the
Samsung contact lens - monitoring blood glucose levels in diabetics
- but it consists of advanced technology that's not far off from
what Samsung is proposing in terms of complexity. Google embedded
miniaturized glucose sensors, a wireless chip and an antenna in
contact lenses, complete with a working prototype that's gone
through clinical research trials.And that was two years ago.One of the primary reasons the public pushed back against Google
Glass was the need for the headgear. Even when mounted on designer
eyeglass frames, Google Glass just looked too obvious, it added
bulk and there are a lot of people who have no desire to wear
glasses.The patent filed by Samsung could lead to augmented reality that
doesn't require any external headgear, while offering a superior
user experience. You wouldn't even know you were wearing it, and
instead of giveaway hand motions for controls, all you would need
to do is look and blink.That is exactly the kind of disruptive move that could kick
augmented reality into the mainstream where Google Glass fell flat
on its face. The problem is that with the Samsung contact lens
being virtually undetectable, the other part of augmented reality
the public hated - the idea of being surreptitiously photographed
or filmed - gets much, much worse.It's so bad, in fact, that having to worry about an
easily-spotted ""Glasshole"" would seem like the good-old-days in comparison.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in

Apple's iPhone Beats Samsung in This Key Area;4/7/2016;"Apple's new iPhone SE. Source: Apple.Beware,AppleandSamsunginvestors: Winter is coming. Until recently, both companies
    have been able to offset declines in computer and tablet sales
    with strong smartphone sales. More recently, investors have
    started to worry about smartphone sales as well. Analyst firmGartnerpredicts that smartphone sales will increase only 7% in 2016,
    leading Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal to predict that
    ""the double-digit growth era for the global smartphone market
    has come to an end.""makeArticleAd();In two of the three largest smartphone markets, the U.S. and
    China, growth will be even harder to come by, with Gartner
    predicting flat year-on-year smartphone growth. Thesecond-largest smartphone market, India, is still predicted to have strong growth, but people
    in the country tend to buy lower-cost devices with razor-thin
    margins.For both companies to overperform, especially in developed
    markets, Apple and Samsung need to increase their respective
    market share percentages. Increasing the number of users who
    upgrade to a new model would be a strong step toward growing
    market share.Apple's upgrade percentage is higher than Samsung'sDuring Apple's last conference call, in January, CEO Tim Cook
    pointed out that60% of people who had an iPhone in September
    2014still hadn't upgraded to a newer phone. The time frame in
    Cook's comment was important, because 2014 is when Apple
    rolled  out the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
    iteration. Slowing upgrade cycles were blamed for the iPhone's
    flat unit and revenue growth last semester. Recently, Apple has
    introduced the smaller, cheaper iPhone SE to encourage
    upgrades.Samsung would love to have Apple's 40% upgrade clip. Areport from Kantar Worldpanelpoints out the differences between the two companies: Samsung's
    upgrade rate between February 2015 and January 2016 was only
    26%.There are a few caveats: Apple's time frame is a little more
    than one year and includes two phone iterations, while
    Samsung's is exactly one year and does not include the newest
    Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge units that were introduced last
    month. That said, Kantar found only 9% of Samsung's users were
    using the then-current-gen Galaxy S6 iteration.The Galaxy S5 outperformed the Galaxy S6Instead, Kantar found a plurality of those upgrading, 26.2%,
    were choosing the Galaxy S5. The Galaxy S6 represented a
    departure from prior versions, with the device looking more
    like Apple's iPhone line. Samsung's phone reboot lost a few
    features Galaxy fans had come to expect, including waterproof
    design, a micro-SD slot, and a swappable battery.Consumer Reports responded byrating the newer phone lowerthan the prior Galaxy S5 iteration. The newer Galaxy S7 brought
    back the waterproof feature and the micro-SD slot and increased
    the S7's battery capacity nearly 20% to make up for the
    swappable-battery feature. That may boost upgrades in high-end
    developed markets and increase upgrades.Apple's Cook has been upfront with his desire to increase
    its market share through ""Android switchers."" The iPhone SE is
    considered a gateway phone by many analysts to introduce many
    mid-range customers to Apple's ecosystem. If anything, Apple's
    newest phone should increase its upgrade percentage from those
    who prefer a smaller phone. Will this help Apple grow unit
    shipments over Gartner's 7% figure? While that's not totally
    clear, Apple's new device further puts pressure on a company
    that sold more off-gen Galaxy S5 units than high-end Galaxy S6
    units. Samsung has been aggressive to compete with Apple on the
    extreme high end but may want to put more marketing money
    behind a solid mid-range unit to mitigate the iPhone SE's
    risk.The stupid-simple way to score a 22% dividendThere's nothing better than cold, hard cash. That's why

    to those figures, Periscope's 200 million broadcasts seem
    paltry.The business of live streamingTwitter reportedly paid over $86 million last year for
    Periscope and Niche, a talent agency for social media stars.
    However, neither platform has been aggressively monetized yet.
    Periscope won an early battle against live-streaming rival
    Meerkat, but the app now faces much tougher competition from
    Facebook and YouTube in the live-streaming arena.Facebook, which has been aggressively beefing up its video
    streaming ecosystem, launched its own live-streaming feature
    for all iOS and Android users earlier this year. YouTube also
     revealed its own live-streaming feature last August.
    Considering that Facebook has  1.6 billion monthly active

    could trample Periscope's active user base -- which reached
    just 10 million last August.What Periscope means to TwitterPeriscope represents one of Twitter's three video strategies,

    integrating Vine loops and Periscope feeds directlyinto its timeline. Those  moves representbaby stepstoward monetization, but pale in comparison to Facebook's and
    YouTube's clear video monetization strategies.More importantly, it's unclear how these efforts will

FIT Stock: Is Fitbit Inc’s CEO Utterly Out of Touch?;4/5/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) shipped 11.6 million watches last year, and 4.1 million during
  the fourth quarter. While good, sales of the Apple Watch have
  been somewhat disappointing, especially considering the scale of
  the company's iPhone.Furthermore, Apple has been unable to lead in a market that many
  thought it would completely dominate, withFitbit Inc(FIT) still holding a 29.5% market share at the end of Q4 versus a
  15% share for Apple after one year in the market.makeArticleAd();Those who thought the Apple Watch and Android Wear's launch
  would destroy Fitbit could not be more wrong, with Fitbit's Q4
  market share higher than its 26.9% share for the entire year.
  This suggests that Fitbit is gaining momentum against its
  competitors.MVP Portfolio: The 6 Best Stocks You Can Buy
      NowIronically, Fitbit's CEO James Park is telling investors how
  it has done the impossible - outperform the tech giantsAlphabet Inc(GOOG,GOOGL) and Apple in wearables.Park's belief is that the Apple Watch and others likeSamsung(SSNLF) do too much, and are too complicated. While you might think
  he's completely out of touch with today's consumer, Fitbit's
  market share and the relatively disappointing performance from
  Apple and Samsung suggest he's right, which bodes well for Fitbit
  stock.Why Park Is Right About FitbitTech giants like Apple and Alphabet are trying to make their
  smartwatches mirror their respective smartphones. These companies
  want to build out their app ecosystems for wearables, and thereby
  allow watches to do everything on a 38mm-to-42mm display that
  consumers do on a 4.7-inch-to-5.5-inch iPhone.Unfortunately, it is not realistic that everyone who purchases
  an Apple Watch wants those capabilities, and by cramming all
  those features into a small wearable, it makes the device
  complicated. That's essentially what Park is saying.Just to be fair, the big takeaway from this year's Mobile
  World Conference is that consumers wanted simplicity in their
  smartwatch, which means that Park is not alone in his analysis.
  Park goes on to say that competitors are not doing a good job at
  promoting their best features, or explaining to consumers ""why""
  they need to purchase the product.Fact is if the Apple Watch has no unique features that set it
  apart from the iPhone, then why buy it? Moreover, if the average
  consumer can't figure out how to get from messaging to contacts
  and then back to the average clock, then Park is right, the
  devices are too difficult and lack a legitimate reason for
  ownership.FIT Stock Is in a League of Its OwnWhat Park has done is emphasize fitness, health and style at
  an affordable price. That is what consumers seem to want, with
  this approach allowing Fitbit to completely dominate the
  wearables market last year. What's most impressive is that
  FIT did so without any smart wearables.Just recently FIT launched its first smart wearable with the
  Blaze, a device that was criticized by analysts for being too
  simple as a smartwatch. Yet, with a lower price point of $199, a
  continued emphasis on design, fitness and health, along with some
  new yet seemingly simple smart features like on-screen workouts
  that interact with the company's leading iOS and Android app.These are just a few of the features that seem too simple for
  the likes of Apple or Samsung, but are important and actually
  useful to those looking to purchase a smartwatch.With that said, we already know that Fitbit is the dominant
  single player in basic wearables, but the Blaze is well on its
  way to causing havoc for Apple and Samsung, with one million
  shipments in its first month. As noted in a previousarticle, the higher price point coupled with superior growth in the
  smart segment versus basic wearables implies great days ahead for
  Fitbit stock.You would not know that FIT is so dominant by looking at
  Fitbit stock, but it is, and while Park may seem out of touch,
  the more likely scenario is that he knows exactly what consumers
  want for their wrist, and that's why the company continues toexceed all expectations.As a result, it's a good bet to assume that Fitbit's strong
  performance in the wearables market will remain if not improve
  thanks to its newly found success in the smart wearables
  industry.And that means FIT stock should follow the company's lead.As of this writing Brian Nichols owns shares of FIT

Who's Building the A9 Chips Inside of the Apple Inc. iPhone SE?;4/4/2016;"The TSMC-built Apple A9. Image credit: Chipworks.Last fall, teardowns conclusively revealed that the A9
    processor inside ofApple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus phones were dual sourced fromSamsungandTSMC-- a first for the iDevice maker.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, two tear-down reports -- one from Chipworks
    and one from iFixit - show the use of an applications processor
    with part number ""APL1022."" This part number represents the A9
    chip manufactured by TSMC.A question that some might have, then, is the following:
    ""Are the A9 chips inside of the iPhone SE exclusively built by
    TSMC, or is Samsung in the mix, too?""Answer? It's bothWithout actually tearing down the chips themselves, there was a
    very simple way to identify -- using the popular performance
    benchmark, Geekbench 3 -- which version of the A9 chip you got
    in your iPhone 6s/6s Plus.Image credit: Author.Take a look at the screen-shot that I took with my iPhone
    6s. You'll notice that the name of the motherboard in this case
    is ""N71mAP."" This particular string refers to the TSMC-built
    A9, while iPhone 6s phones with motherboards that are
    identified as simply ""N71AP"" have Samsung-built A9 chips.To try to figure out if the iPhone SE uses applications
    processors sourced from both chipmakers (something that is very
    likely to be the case), I looked at the different iPhone SE
    models that have been popping up in the database.Sure enough, it turns out that there are two distinct
    motherboards for the iPhone SE as well. One identifies as
    ""N69AP"" while the other shows up as ""N69uAP."" It's not clear at
    this time which one refers to the TSMC chip and which to the
    Samsung chip, but it seems clear to me that both are used.Why did Apple pick the A9 for the SE?A question that springs to mind is: ""Why did Apple use the more
    powerful A9 for the iPhone SE?""A number of really good reasons come to mind.First, the A8 chip inside of the iPhone 6/6 Plus is built on
    TSMC's 20-nanometer process. The Taiwan-based foundry has been
    quite clear that it wants to reuse factory space and equipment
    from 20-nanometer for production of 16-nanometer manufacturing,
    especially since the processes are in key ways quite
    similar.Next, Apple is seemingly trying to gain share at the
    $399-$499 price points and one relatively inexpensive way to
    differentiate in this market is to use a class-leading
    applications processor. Indeed, the older A8 offered a
    respectable amount of performance, but the A9 offers arguably
    the best CPU performance available in a mobile device today and
    extremely high graphics performance.Finally, the A9 integrates the M9 motion co-processor onto
    the same die, which likely allowed Apple to save some space on
    the logic board. A smaller logic board means that more room in
    the already small and slim chassis can be dedicated to the
    battery.Indeed, teardowns show that the iPhone SE packs a battery
    with larger capacity than the one in the 5s and nearly as large
    as the one in the iPhone 6s.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Apple Inc. and Intel Corporation: April Fools' Joke Gone Wrong;4/4/2016;"Image credit: Apple.There has been a lot of hope on the part of someIntelbulls thatApplewill either use Intel-designed modems or
    Apple-designed-but-Intel-manufactured applications processors
    in coming iPhone models.makeArticleAd();On April 2, author Manikandan Raman with Benzinga penned apiece""explaining"" the reasoning behind Apple's ""announcement"" that
    it will be using Intel-designed applications processors in
    future iPhone and iPad devices, citing aforum poston SemiWiki by Semiconductor Advisors' Robert Maire.Unfortunately, the author of this article should have
    realized that this was a not-so-subtle April Fools' day
    joke.How can you tell?First of all, the ""joint announcement"" claimed in the SemiWiki
    forum post and regurgitated in the Benzinga article is nowhere
    to be found on Apple's or Intel's respective websites. That,
    aside from the fact that this was posted on April 1, should
    have been a pretty big tip-off.However, even if one doesn't allow those two facts deter
    them, the ""quotes"" included in the ""report"" are very clearly
    fabricated and are intended to be humorous.Indeed, the crux of the joke is that if Apple were to try to
    run its pre-existing iOS software on an Intel processor, the
    processor would be unable to understand any of the code,
    rendering the device 100% unusable. This ""un-usability"" would
    mean that the device would be ""un-hackable"" by entities such as
    the FBI because the device couldn't do anything.Why write about this?Normally, it wouldn't be worth this Fool's time to write about
    what is very clearly an April Fools' joke. However, the fact
    that this ""story"" was picked up by a reputable site such as
    Benzinga and is being circulated means that there will probably
    be some investors who believe this ""report"" -- at least for a
    time.The problem with ""believing"" this report is that if Intel
    were to actually manufacture all of Apple's A-series chips from
    here on out, this would probably cause something of a seismic
    shift in the semiconductor industry.In this case, Intel would get atonof quite-profitable leading-edge foundry work whileTaiwan SemiconductorandSamsungwould be ""looped out"" of Apple's chip manufacturing plans going
    forward, as it were. Given how important Apple is to the
    foundry landscape, this would be a big deal.What's actually going on?Intel is not expected to manufacture the applications
    processors that will go into Apple's next-generation iPhones or
    iPads. It is generally believed that Taiwan-based contract
    manufacturer TSMC will build the A10 chips for the next
    generation iPhone 7-series processors. Beyond that, there
    haven't been any confirmations of Apple's process choices for
    future Apple processors.That being said, TSMC executives have stated that it intends
    to start the 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology
    generation with ""a very high market share"" and ""[TSMC]
    intend[s] not to lose it."" This is probably a good indication
    that Apple will build the majority of its next-generation
    10-nanometer processors at TSMC, rather than at either Intel or
    Samsung.There are also rumors that Intel may end up sharing the
    cellular modem spot withQualcomminside the next-generation iPhone 7-series phones expected to

Apple Inc. iPad Pro 9.7-Inch First Impressions;4/2/2016;"Image source: Apple.As I said in aprevious article, I planned to place an order forApple's latest iPad, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, as soon as they were
    available on the iDevice maker's online store. Sure enough, I
    did just that and several hours ago my iPad Pro arrived in the
    mail.makeArticleAd();Although I plan to follow this column up with a more
    detailed review once I've spent some more time with the device,
    there are several thoughts that I would like to get out there
    following my first several hours using the device.Without further ado, let's get to it.New display is awesome; True Tone is incredibleOne of the big problems that I've had with many iDevices is
    that they are simply calibrated out of the factory to be ""too
    blue."" When Apple's new True Tone feature (which adjusts the
    color temperature of the display to match current ambient
    lighting conditions) is disabled, the display is -- as per
    usual for Apple's iDevices -- too blue.However, when the True Tone feature is enabled, the white
    balance of the display looks far more accurate and pleasing.
    Additionally, the display appears to have a higher contrast
    ratio than my older iPad Air 2 and looks about on par with the
    display on my iPhone 6s.Finally, as somebody who is a fan of the ""AMOLED Photo""
    display mode on theSamsungGalaxy S7/S7 Edge series of phones (which enlarges the color
    gamut to Adobe RGB, a much wider color space than sRGB), I
    enjoy the richer color saturation of the iPad Pro 9.7-inch
    display. Coverage of the wider DCI P3 color gamut in this new
    iPad makes colors really ""pop"" compared to those on my older
    iPad or even on my iPhone 6s.Excellent soundAnother one of the big features of the iPad Pro lineup is the
    use of a quad speaker setup. Sound on this new iPad is quite
    loud and ""full"" compared to that on my older iPad Air 2. When
    playing games, listening to music, and playing video clips/TV
    shows, the new speaker system is a big step up from the one
    found in the Air 2.Crazy speedThe iPad Air 2 was already quite fast -- arguably the fastest
    non-Windows tablet out there aside from Apple's larger iPad
    Pro. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro packs in a performance-reduced
    version of the A9X processor inside of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro,
    but it's still appreciably quicker than the iPad Air 2.Web pages load a bit quicker, intense 3D games like Dead
    Trigger 2 appear to run more smoothly, and scrolling also seems
    smoother (the new content that's being pushed onto the display
    seems to render quicker).This is an incredibly quick tablet; I suspect that in terms
    of performance the device will age quite well (which is good
    for the consumer, but obviously not-so-great for Apple which
    likely wants to find ways to shorten iPad upgrade cycles, not
    lengthen them).Is it worth the money? Can it save the iPad business?I don't think very many people upgrade their iPads every year
    or even every two years; unless you're just a big fan of having
    the latest iPads, I would say that sticking to a cycle of three
    to four years seems sensible.For users of the iPad Air 2, there are clear benefits to the
    new Pro but probably not enough to justify the $599-plus price
    tag for most people. However, for all users of older iPads -
    say, iPad 2 through 4 -- the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro is probably
    a worthwhile upgrade.The only fly in the proverbial ointment is that a good
    portion of older iPad users probably have newer, larger
    iPhones. Although a 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch display isn't anywhere
    close to as large as the 9.7-inch display on the new iPad Pro,
    the larger phones will be ""good enough"" for most use cases.Although I really like the new iPad Pro so far, I'm not
    convinced it'll be enough to put iPad back on a growth
    track.3 companies poised to explode when cable
      diesCable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to
      explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally

Apple Inc.: iPhone SE Review (AAPL);4/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwo years ago,Apple Inc.(AAPL) gave in to the relentless march toward bigger screens, releasing
the iPhone 6 and super-sized iPhone 6 Plus. Fans of smaller, 4-inch
phones were left with the 2013 vintage iPhone 5S, a drought that
lasted until March 21 when theiPhone
SEwas unveiled.Source: AppleThe funny thing is that despite an aging CPU, lower resolution
camera and chunky design, people didn't stop buying those old
4-inch iPhones. In fact, at its 'Let Us Loop You In' event,
Apple said it sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015.makeArticleAd();To put that in some perspective, China'sXiaomiwas the world's fifth largest smartphone vendor,moving 72 million smartphonesin total in 2015.It's not just the sales numbers that drove Apple to release the
iPhone SE. It's that Apple is continuing to push Apple Pay adoption
and older iPhones don't support it, even those like the iPhone 5s
that have a Touch ID sensor.The company wants to geteveryoneusing Apple Pay.Both Apple and third party developers also prefer to have recent
hardware in circulation. Older iPhones cut into the adoption rate
of new iOS releases and lower the potential market for apps that
use new iPhone features.Galaxy S7 Edge Review: Samsung Unleashes the
    Ultimate Android SmartphoneWith iPhone SE pre-orders now arriving, what's the verdict on
Apple's new, small iPhone? Read our iPhone SE review to find
out.iPhone SE's Familiar LookFor a while it seemed likely that Apple would release a mini
version of the iPhone 6S.Instead, the company delivered what is clearly an iPhone 5S with
a few nods to its more recent iPhones. The iPhone SE has the
chunkier iPhone 5 look with its chamfered edges, but adds a
color-matched stainless steel logo on the back and gains the Rose
Gold option of the iPhone 6S.The result is a device that's extremely comfortable to hold.
Because it's lighter, physically smaller and less rounded, the
iPhone SE is also easier to grip securely than the iPhone 6
series.The 4-inch Retina display doesn't break any new ground, but its
size delivers that ease of one-handed use that many users missed
when the iPhone 6 grew to 4.7-inches. If you have small hands and
have been refusing to relinquish your iPhone 5 or 5S, you'll be
very pleased with the iPhone SE.Impressive PerformanceApple held back a few features with the iPhone SE. It lacks 3D
Touch support and a barometer, and the front selfie camera remains
at just 1.2 megapixels, but everything else about the small
iPhone is top-notch.It gets the same 64-bit A9 CPU with 2GB of RAM powering the
iPhone 6S. It also gains that phone's impressive 12MP iSight camera
and the advanced photo features like Live Photos, 4k video and 63MP
panorama shots.The Touch ID sensor isn't the second generation version found in
the iPhone 6S, but it is faster than the iPhone 5S's and an NFC
chip is included to support Apple Pay. Battery life is actually
better than the iPhone 6S for applications that involve the display
(which makes sense given its smaller size and fewer pixels),
including 13 hours of video playback or Wi-Fi web surfing compared
to 11 hours for the larger iPhone.In short, the only real concession most iPhone SE buyers will be
making compared to Apple's flagship devices is display size - and
many of them wanted that in the first place …Next PageiPhone SE Key SpecsSource: Apple4-inch LED Retina display (1136 x 640 pixels)64-bit A9 CPU with embedded M9 motion coprocessor16GB or 64GB storageLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, NFCTouch ID fingerprint sensor12MP f/2.2 iSight camera with Focus Pixels, Live Photo, True

finally has a no-compromise small phone in its lineup again, and it
is a far better - and less expensive - mid-range phone than
the iPhone 5c.Apple Inc.: 10 Things You Want to Know About
    the iPhone SEOne thing leaves a bad taste in the mouth when it comes to the
iPhone SE: the cheap move to include just 16GB of storage.Yes, Apple does the same thing with its flagship phones, but it
seems just a little more in your face to promote the iPhone SE's
affordable $399 price along with features like Live Photos and 4K
video that will make short work of the storage on the base model.
When you include the space taken up by iOS, there is only 12GB or
so left for all of a user's apps, videos, messages, music and
photos.Considering that justthree minutes of 4K video will chew up over 1 GB of
that storage, anyone planning to actually use the iPhone SE for shooting photos
and video (or keeping lots of apps and other content locally)
pretty much needs to move up to the 64GB version at $499. And
that's not quite the same bargain.Of course Apple will make a better profit margin on each 64GB
model it makes, so that decision is much more positive from an
investor perspective. With the addition of Apple Pay and a modern
CPU able to support new versions of iOS, Apple and its partners
benefit from the release of the iPhone SE.And for consumers looking for an affordable or small-screen
smartphone from Apple, the iPhone SE is a welcome option. So it's a
win-win all around.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a
  position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Galaxy S7 Review: The Smartphone to Beat in 2017

How Long Will It Take Facebook Inc. To Recoup $2 Billion On Oculus?;4/1/2016;"Facebook's Oculus VR recently started shipping its first batch of
    Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets. The device is widely
    expected to be a bellwether for the fledgling VR market, which
    tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital expects to grow from
    nearly nothing today to a $30 billion market by  2020.
    That's why Facebook was willing to pay $2 billion ($1.6 billion
    in stock and the rest in cash) for Oculus nearly two years
    ago.Source: Oculus VR.makeArticleAd();But for Facebook investors, Oculus Rift sales probably won't
    generate much meaningful revenue over the next few quarters.Piper Jaffrayestimated last year that the Oculus Rift would account for just
    3.6 million of the 12.2 million VR headsets shipped in 2016.
    Based on its $600 launch price, that would translate to $2.16
    billion in revenue -- roughly 8% of its projected sales for
    2016.After factoring in material costs and other expenses, how
    long could it actually take Facebook to recoup the $2 billion
    it spent on Oculus?How much does the Oculus cost to make?Since the commercial version of the Oculus Rift just shipped,
    there aren't any detailed teardowns regarding material costs as
    of this writing. But a recentGoldman Sachsforecast claims that the Oculus Rift has a BOM of $500.
    Assuming that estimate is accurate, the addition of R&D and
    marketing expenses means that Facebook would barely break even
    on each headset sale.That wouldn't be surprising, considering that modern gaming
    consoles are sold on the same paper-thin margins. An early IHS
    teardown ofMicrosoft's Xbox One, which launched at $499, revealed that the console
    had a combined BOM and manufacturing cost of $471. The firm
    also reported thatSony's PS4, which launched at $399, cost $381 to  make. The
    addition of R&D and marketing expenses meant that both
    consoles were probably sold at a loss.It's all about the softwareMicrosoft and Sony can afford to sell their consoles at thin
    margins or losses because they can recoup the revenue through
    game sales. Both companies generally receive a royalty ofabout 12% for each game sold for their consoles. Market
    tracking site VGChartz reports that average Xbox One and PS4
    ownershave each bought about six games so far. Assuming that each
    game costs $60, Microsoft and Sony will have made an extra $42
    off each customer -- a number that will keep rising as both
    consoles mature.Facebook is likely pursuing a similar strategy for Oculus.
    Last year, it launched a dedicated VR app and media store
    called Oculus Home, which also works withSamsung's $99 Gear VR headset. Piper Jaffray estimates that Samsung
    will sell 5 million Gear VRs this year, which means that 8.6
    million consumers' eyes could be glued to Oculus Home apps by
    the end of the year.Oculus Home. Source: Oculus VR.Facebook takes a 30% cut from Oculus app sales, which is in
    line with the standard cut for mobile apps. The initial batch
    of Oculus games cost  between $10 and $60. If each Oculus
    Rift owner buys about six games by the end of the year for an
    average price of $30, that would translate to an extra $54 per
    customer -- which would make each headset sale profitable, with
    nearly $200 million in high-margin revenue based on estimated
    Rift sales alone. The addition of cheaper mobile-based games on
    the Gear VR could add a few million to that total.But it's all speculation for nowResearch firm Tractica recently forecast that worldwide sales
    of VR headsets could surge past 200 million units by
     2020. Assuming that the Oculus Rift accounts for a third
    of those shipments while its software ecosystem keeps growing,
    it's certainly possible for Facebook to recoup the $2 billion
    it spent on Oculus within the next decade.But during last quarter's conference call (as transcribed byThomson Reuters), CFO Dave Wehner warned that the impact of Oculus Rift
    shipments would be ""immaterial"" to its total expenses and
    financials for the year, and that it was still too ""early to be
    talking about large volume"" shipments. Wehner also noted that
    the Rift comes ""early in the evolution of VR,"" strongly
    suggesting that even Facebook doesn't know how well the headset
    will sell.What investors should focus onFacebook likes to buy companies like Instagram, WhatsApp, and
    Oculus, and build up their user bases before monetizing them.
    But as we've seen with Instagram, its monetization strategies
    pay off once users are fenced in. It's unclear if Facebook can
    do the same for Oculus, but if it does, it will have
    established an enviable first-mover's position in the growing
    VR market. But for now, investors should focus on the evolution
    of Facebook's core ad business instead of speculative plays
    like Oculus.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you
      something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't
      miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their
      brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Winners from the Apple Inc. iPhone SE Teardown;3/31/2016;"Apple's iPhone SE. Image credit: Apple.On March 21,Appleannounced the latest addition to its iPhone lineup -- the
    iPhone SE. The device is priced as the company's entry level
    model, with the 16 gigabyte version selling for $399 and the 64
    gigabyte model coming in at $499.makeArticleAd();Aside from its price, the device is novel because it has
    very high end processing performance and retains the display
    size and industrial design of the popular iPhone 5s.Teardown specialists at Chipworksgot aholdof an iPhone SE and many of the major components inside have
    been identified. Here are three of the winners.No. 1: InvenSenseIn a priorarticle, I suggested that since the iPhone SE recycles components from
    the iPhone 6/6s, it could very well move to an iPhone 6/6s
    class motion processor. If Apple were to do this, rather than
    recycle the one used in the iPhone 5s, then this would
    represent a win for InvenSense which was not included in the 5s
    but did win spots in the iPhone 6 and 6s-series of devices.The Chipworks tear-down shows that this is exactly what
    happened with the iPhone SE.Given that iPhone 6s-series phones have seen
    weaker-than-expected demand and given that InvenSense
    apparently lost the main motion processor spot in theSamsungGalaxy S7, the motion processing specialist could certainly use
    this win.No. 2: Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic has long provided audio chips into Apple's
    devices, so it's not surprising that the iPhone SE packs two
    audio chips from the chipmaker. What's interesting, though, is
    that Chipworks says that these chips are the same ones that are
    found in the iPhone 6s/6s Plus.It isbelievedthat Cirrus saw a boost in dollar content boost in the iPhone
    6s/6s Plus (and by implication the iPhone SE) relative to the
    prior generation iPhone 6/6 Plus (and certainly relative to the
    iPhone 5s). To the extent that iPhone SE sales take the place
    of would-have-been iPhone 5s sales as well as cannibalize
    iPhone 6/6 Plus sales, Cirrus should benefit.No. 3: QualcommIn going from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6s, Apple has
    apparently adopted Qualcomm's MDM9625M modem and accompanying
    WTR1625L RF transceiver. This is the same cellular modem and RF
    transceiver that was found inside of the iPhone 6/6 Plus
    generation of smartphones.Though not a terribly huge win for Qualcomm, the wireless
    chip giant does get to see some increased content relative to
    what it had inside of the iPhone 5s. Given that Apple shipped
    at least 30 million iPhone 5s phones in 2015, and given the
    attractive price point and feature-set of the new phone, this
    could work out to be a small positive for Qualcomm overall.The thing that investors should really watch for, though, is
    what kind of content increases Qualcomm will see in the next
    generation iPhone and whether it will ultimately have toshare those spotswith a competitor.Interesting, but not game changingAt the end of the day, the iPhone SE should be a nice device
    for some of Apple's suppliers, particularly the first two
    mentioned in the above list. However, what is really going to
    be important to investors in Apple suppliers is what components
    the iDevice maker uses in the iPhone 7/7 Plus and how that
    content compares to that in the iPhone 6s/6s Plus.3 companies poised to explode when cable

Fitbit Inc Stock Prepares for Takeoff After Blaze & Alta Data (FIT);3/31/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    TipsWhenFitbit Inc(FIT) announced the launch of a smartwatch, the Blaze, some thought
  it could be successful, but also knew it would be tough to
  compete against the likes ofApple Inc.(AAPL),Samsung(SSNLF) andAlphabet Inc's (GOOG,GOOGL) Android Wear.Up until this point, Fitbit has dominated the basic segment of
  the wearables market with its fitness trackers, but smart
  wearables enter the company into a new space with faster growth
  and higher-priced merchandise.makeArticleAd();In other words, success in the smart wearables arena could be
  a game changer for Fibit stock.And based on what the company recently told us, FIT stock is
  about to reverse its bad fortunes.10 Stellar Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for Q2According to FIT, thecompany has already shippedmore than one million Blaze devices in its first month of retail
  availability. That makes the Blaze No. 1 in both the smartwatch
  and heart monitor categories on Amazon.com, and also well exceeds
  the expectations of any analyst on the street, most of whom
  expected a rather slow launch due to limited marketing and
  advertising from Fitbit.As a result, one might conclude that the strong performance is
  from word of mouth, and potentially pre-existing Fitbit owners
  who upgraded to the smart technology. Currently, there are 1,224
  reviews on Amazon, with 83% giving it a 4- or 5-star rating.What Does 1 Million Shipments Mean for FIT Stock?Fitbit stock is currently higher by over 10% in response to
  this news. FIT shares are still lower by 50% this year
  despite expectations for 31.5% revenue growth in 2016 and a stock
  that is trading at just 10x FY2017 EPS.That said, Fitbit's Q1 guidance at a midpoint of $430
  million in revenue implies growth of 27.9%, or nearly $100
  million greater than the same period last year.Some analysts and Fitbit shorts may conclude that the $100
  million increase in sales the company forecasted figures strong
  Blaze and Alta sales, which are two of the company's newest
  products. However, I argue that the success with Blaze and
  Alta is completely unexpected, and becomes a massive short- and
  long-term catalyst for Fitbit stock.One million Blaze sales at $200 equal revenue of $200 million
  from this single product. Keep in mind, that's one month only!
  Then, Fitbit also disclosed that its newly launched Alta also
  surpassed one million shipments at $129 per, thereby creating
  $129 million in revenue. Combined, that's $329 million, and once
  more, that's from one month only!Then, you have to figure Fitbit's existing product line of
  basic wearables. Nearly 80% of Fitbit's Q4 revenue came from
  newer products like the Charge, Charge HR and Surge. Therefore,
  one must conclude that Fitbit figured on most of its revenue
  being created from these noted products during the first quarter,
  especially with low expectations and limited availability
  from the Alta and Blaze during Q1.When you add it all up, it is easy to see how Q1 revenue could
  be $100 million greater than analysts currently expect. And more
  importantly, guidance should well exceed the company's previously
  outlook. With 21.4 million shipments last year and revenue of
  $1.86 billion, Fitbit creates a little more than $85 per device
  shipped. However, the Blaze ($199) and the Alta ($129) are far
  more expensive products, and will quickly boost its average
  selling price, and its revenue.Fitbit Stock Gains to FollowI explained earlier this year that if Fitbit couldship just three million Blazeor smart devices annually, it would create an additional
  $600 million in annual revenue.At the time, I was just hoping FIT could create this
  additional revenue by 2019. Never did I expect it would likely
  surpass this mark in 2016. After all, if Fitbit has already
  surpassed one million Blaze shipments, in just one month, just
  think of what it will ship this year.With over 31 million shares short, and Fitbit stock already
  cheap, the scene has been set for FIT stock to reverse and trade
  significantly higher in the weeks ahead, and for Fitbit to both
  beat Q1 expectations and raise guidance.True, FIT stock has traded lower when it should have risen for
  several months now, but given these new developments, and its
  valuation, it is tough to imagine Fitbit stock is going anywhere
  but higher.As of this writing, Brian Nichols owns shares of FIT

Can Samsung Pull Off Its Biggest Transition Ever?;3/30/2016;"More recently, Samsung has been faulted for heavily taking
    design cues from Apple. Image source: Samsung.Silicon Valley's next big export appears to be its
    start-up-focused culture.Samsung, the South Korean technology conglomerate, recently held
    a ""Startup Samsung"" ceremony to emphasize the company's attempt
    to transition from a heavily hierarchical company to a
    fast-moving, flat business model to spur innovation and
    collaboration.makeArticleAd();You can't blame Samsung for attempting to change. Three
    years ago, Samsung commanded such a large percentage of Android
    market share thatAlphabet(then Google) actually feared the company would attempt to
    leverage its market share to extract further concessions from
    Alphabet's core search and ad-based businesses.More recently, the company has endured market share erosion
    amid competition on the high end fromAppleand in the low-end, developing markets from a host of
    manufacturers also sporting Android's operating system. In the
    last year alone, Samsung lost 2.2 percentage points of market
    share, according to data from research firm IDC. But asking
    whether this change of mind-set will help Samsung is probably
    not the correct question to ask.Can Samsung even change?According to aReuters articleabout the shift in corporate culture, the company will reduce
    unnecessary overtime and weekend work and cut down on
    unnecessary meetings. South Korean culture is notorious for
    long work hours with the Organization for Economic Cooperation
    and Development pegging average annual hours worked there at
    2,057 last year, 15% higher than the United States' average of
    1,789.A CNN articlecomments on a culture where employees feel they can never say
    no to the boss.This culture is not ideal for technology, disruption, or
    even a safe working environment.New York Timesbest-selling author Malcolm Gladwell faulted South Korean
    authoritarian culture and blind deference to authority for
    Korean Air'spoor record of plane crashesin the 1990s in his bookOutliers: The Story of Success. In the book, Gladwell blames South Korea's hierarchical
    structure being incongruent with planes designed to be flown by
    two equals. In this case, South Korea's cultural norms led to a
    string of possibly preventable airplane crashes and deaths.If Samsung succeeds, will Apple lose out?If Samsung succeeds in instilling a change-oriented culture, it
    could be Apple that loses out. More recently, a few around
    Silicon Valley have called Apple out for a lack of new ideas
    and features in its last product event. Verge Executive Editor
    Walt Mossberg summed up the introduction of new iPads and
    iPhone SE as ""derivative products and price cuts.""Additionally, Mossberg wrote an article in Re/code with the
    title ""The iPhone 7 Had Better Be Spectacular,"" calling Samsung's newest Galaxy S7 ""beautiful"" and
    ""carefully engineered."" Outside of the curved-edge feature,
    though, many of Samsung's recent features for the Galaxy S6 and
    Galaxy S7 were essentially copied from Apple's iPhone line.
    From a form-factor standpoint, perhaps the biggest innovation
    was Samsung's Galaxy Edge feature. If Samsung is able to
    instill a start-up mentality, it could go a long way toward
    disruption and innovation at the expense of its U.S.
    competitor.That said, it will be difficult for Samsung to quickly
    embrace a start-up mind-set. Changing a corporate culture is
    hard; changing a national culture is even harder.The stupid-simple way to score a 22% dividendThere's nothing better than cold, hard cash. That's why the

The Hidden Problem Reflected in Apple Inc.’s New iPhone and iPad;3/30/2016;"Image source: AppleIt's hard to question the most valuable company in the
    world's product vision, but I'm going to do just that.makeArticleAd();Perhaps the most widely discussed tech event this month wasApple's March 21 product presentation, at which the tech giant
    debuted a number of product changes, most notably its new
    4-inch iPhone SE  and updated iPad Pro.In a technical sense, Apple's latest devices are certainly
    impressive, and both its new iPhone and iPad will almost
    assuredly help Apple sell more devices. However, in connecting
    Apple's most recent product launch with its overall product
    roadmap in recent years, I find myself wondering about
    something that, if true, could spell trouble for Apple and its
    investors: Has Apple's product development lost its
    revolutionary touch?Still thinking different?Let's kick-start this discussion with a question: What was the
    last product Apple produced that, in your view, was an
    appreciable leap forward in its category?Image source: AppleApple is a company whose brand identity, for better or
    worse, is built upon revolution, not evolution. However, since
    the iPad's launch in 2010, there's a legitimate case to be made
    that no new Apple product has been meaningfully different from
    its predecessors. Even the Apple Watch -- though I remain quite
    bullish on its long-term potential -- is in many ways simply a
    wrist-sized iPod Touch. To be sure, each successive iPhone,
    iPad, and Mac upgrade ushers in incremental improvements across
    software, hardware, and design. To be clear, the overall
    direction is positive, and consistently so. However, they
    pace  seems frustratingly incremental for a company that
    has wowed the world with such frequency.Moreover, which of Apple's recent major product updates
    wasn't in part shaped by the industry, as opposed to Apple's
    historically independent approach to product design? The screen
    size increase for the iPhone 6 was pretty clearly influenced by
    the success of larger Android devices fromSamsung,HTC, and others. The larger screen size and addition of a stylus
    in the iPad Pro last year appeared in part motivated  byMicrosoft's Surface Pro. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Apple at its best
    didn't react to the product machinations of competitors, which
    has me partially concerned.A more nuanced takeThough one can't simply compare the past to the present, I find
    myself continuing to contrast Apple's recent product moves to
    the old story about Steve Jobs' product overhaul when he
    returned to Apple in the 1997. Here's Jobs talking about the
    renewed simplicity and focus that led to Apple's eventual
    string of product hits.Source: JackIsBack 15 via YouTube.Apple's product portfolio remains far less complicated than
    the convoluted jumble Jobs described in the video. However, in
    recent years, the trend in Apple products' evolution has been
    one of broadening its offerings within each of its current
    platforms. This isn't necessarily a negative either. In fact,
    from a financial perspective, Apple's increasingly diverse
    suite of products is simply good business.Apple opened the iPhone section of its March event by
    providing a critical piece of context. In the past year, the
    company sold 30 million of its 4-inch iPhones. What's more,
    these smaller models play particularly well among first-time
    iPhone buyers, particularly in key emerging markets like China.
    This could well reflect Apple's long-standing tendency to
    discount its older handsets. Last year, with its move to
    larger-screened flagship models, Apple's cheapest iPhones were
    also its smallest. Now, with updated hardware in a smaller
    device at a $399 starting price, it seems the new iPhone SE
    could become a powerful tool to draw ever-greater numbers of
    users into Apple's ecosystem.More broadly, this shift speaks to the unprecedented growth
    challenges Apple must navigate. More so than at any time in its
    past, Apple must notch massive wins to deliver incremental
    growth to its shareholders. Last year, Apple produced roughly
    $234 billion in sales.  To grow its sales just 10% in
    2016, Apple will need to drive $23.4 billion in fresh sales.
    However, just 10 years ago, Apple produced $24 billion intotal annual sales.Such is Apple's current scope that maintaining even moderate
    growth requires once unimaginable success year-in and year-out.
    Seen through this lens, Apple's diversifying its product
    portfolio to tap into various pockets of opportunity seems an
    understandable tactic.What's more, with potentially revolutionary products like
    its Project Titan automotive initiative or its HomeKit
    smart-home hub -- an area I feel Apple could be well-positioned
    to dominate -- the firm clearly has its eyes trained on shaping
    the future with potentially revolutionary products. Given its
    longtime penchant for secrecy, Apple doesn't prioritize
    broadcasting these efforts.In the end, I'm more interested here in opening the
    conversation than in making a strong argument one way or
    another on this subject. However, as someone who has followed
    the goings-on at the company daily for the more than five
    years, this subtle, Cook-era shift has come into sharper focus
    in recent years. Would the company have followed a similar
    course under the legendary Jobs? That's anyone's guess.
    However, though Apple's March product event was without
    question more derivative than watershed, it also spoke to the
    increased complexity that comes with being one of the world's
    largest companies.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

Apple Inc.’s 2017 Flagship iPhone Looks to Borrow from Samsung and Xiaomi;3/29/2016;"Apple's iPhone family. Image credit: Apple.Even though theAppleiPhone 7/7 Plus have yet to be unveiled, KGI Securities analyst
    Ming-Chi Kuo reportedly released a research note over the
    weekend (viaMacRumors) shedding some light on what the iDevice maker has planned for
    its 2017 flagship iPhone.makeArticleAd();The flagship phone will reportedly pack a 5.8-inch AMOLED
    display -- a shift away from the liquid crystal displays that
    Apple has used in all of its iPhones to date. The display is
    also expected to be curved, which Kuo says will allow the
    smartphone to fit in a footprint that might be even smaller
    than that of the current generation 5.5-inch iPhone 6s
    Plus.But that's not all. In addition to a curved display, Apple
    is reportedly looking to eschew the aluminum casings the
    hallmark of iPhone's look and feel since the 2012 release of
    the iPhone 5. Instead, Apple is said to be evaluating plastic,
    ceramic, and glass for the back of the phone; Kuo is confident
    that Apple will ultimately go with glass.After reading a summary of Kuo's note, it's hard to shake
    off the feeling that the iDevice maker has now assumed the role
    of afollowerrather than a leader -- at least when it comes to smartphone
    industrial design and, in some cases, technology.Curved AMOLED display? Samsung has been doing it for a
    whileIn late 2014, Apple arch-rivalSamsungreleased the Galaxy Note 4 Edge, a variant of its Galaxy Note 4
    ""phablet"" with one side of the display curved into the body. It
    was essentially a gimmick, but Samsung refined it with the
    Galaxy S6 Edge, with the display curving intobothsides of the phone.Samsung also ran with this concept with the recently
    released Galaxy S7 Edge.If Apple implements this in a flagship iPhone in (presumably
    late) 2017, it will ""catch up"" to what Samsung has been
    fielding into the marketplace since early 2015.Curved glass? Ceramic? Also been doneThe Galaxy S7 also features a metal frame with a glass back.
    Xiaomi, a China-based smartphone vendor, recently announced a
    new family of flagship devices as well -- the Mi5 series. The
    two lower-tier models feature metal frames and glass backs
    similar to the Galaxy S7, while the top tier Mi5 (known as the
    Mi5 Pro) actually comes with a ceramic back.In other words, the big ""materials change"" that Apple is
    apparently looking to implement has, once again, already been
    done by another, much smaller competitor to the iDevice
    maker.Apple must lead, not followApple is obviously the largest and most profitable smartphone
    maker out there. It has high customer loyalty rates and easily
    the highest blended average selling prices in the smartphone
    industry. From a business perspective, the company is still
    solidly in the lead.However, during the iPhone 6s/6s Plus cycle, a number of
    ""cracks"" in the armor have really begun to show in the
    company's competitive positioning. It no longer fields phones
    with best in class displays, its cameras are good, but no
    longer the ""gold standard"" that they once were.""Friend of Apple"" Walt Mossberg recent penned acolumnin which he points out the myriad ways in which Apple needs to
    catch up to the competition.To make matters worse, Apple releases flagship phones on
    merely a yearly cadence, while the competition puts out
    flagship devices at a much more rapid clip.I can't shake the feeling that Apple is getting complacent.
    Perhaps the fact that the company is set to experience its very
    first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales will serve as the
    rude wake-up call that it really seems to need.3 companies poised to explode when cable

What’s the Fuss About the Dual-Camera Apple Inc. May Use in the iPhone 7?;3/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are many rumors floating around about whatApple Inc.(AAPL) plans for its upcoming iPhone 7 series smartphones. Dropping the
headphone jack, making it waterproof and going as thin as the iPod
Touch are routinely bandied about. However, the feature that could
make or break this next generation of Apple's flagship smartphone
is the dual camera being tipped to appear in the iPhone 7 Plus.Source: LinXWhat exactly is a dual iPhone camera system, what advantages
would it offer and how could incorporating this feature be a big
win for Apple?makeArticleAd();To understand the significance of the dual-camera to the iPhone
7, there are four threads that need to be followed.What Prompted AAPL's Change?First, there is the problem ofsoftening iPhone sales. The iPhone is Apple's dominant revenue generator but after nearly
a decade of wild sales increases that have been the primary factor
in driving AAPL stock, the company is forecasting its first ever
iPhone sales decline.8 High-Quality, High-Dividend Stocks to Buy for
    Q2Second, there is the iPhone camera effect. One of the reasons
for the iPhone's popularity has always been its camera. Apple pays
particular attention to camera quality, avoiding the megapixel arms
race tactics employed by most smartphone manufacturers.The iPhone camera has proved so popular it has helped to
decimate sales of point-and-shoot digital cameras, and according toYahoo! Inc.'s (YHOO) Flikr -a photo sharing service frequently used as a benchmark for
camera popularity-42% of photographers who uploaded photos took them
with an iPhone. Second and third place were captured by DSLR cameras fromCanon Inc. (ADR)(CAJ) andNikon Corp (ADR)(NINOY).Interestingly, a large percentage of those iPhone users also
uploaded photos taken with a DSLR, indicating they turn to the
bigger camera for some of their key photos.The third thread? Apple's smartphone arch-rivalSamsung(SSNLF) recently released its new Galaxy S7, paying particular attention
to its camera. For the first time in recent memory, photo testing
sites have crowned theSamsung smartphone's camera as the best, handily beating the iPhone camera.Finally, nearly one year ago,AAPL acquiredLinX, an Israeli company that has developed advanced camera technology.
The company's dual-camera system offers a huge advance in mobile
photography, including greatly improved low-light photos and
optical zoom capability. The LinX technology has the potential to
not only produce a huge leap forward in smartphone cameras, it
could put them at levels comparable to the DSLRs that Canon and
Nikon are clinging to as their prosumer photography stronghold.When you weave these threads together, you end up with an iPhone
7 - most likely the iPhone 7 Plus, in order to further
differentiate Apple's big smartphone from its standard model -
that's equipped with a killer, dual-lens camera capable of DSLR-
quality photos.And it could be a very big deal.Fighting for the Camera TitleOffering improved mobile photography overall with the LinX
dual-camera system would be a big win for Apple, helping it to
regain ""best mobile camera"" bragging rights from Samsung.More importantly, an iPhone 7 Plus with optical zoom capability
would represent an entirely new level of camera capability in a
smartphone. It would be a must-have feature capable of
convincing current iPhone owners (for whom Flikr stats suggest
photography is a big deal) to upgrade. It could be a big enough
deal to drive some Android users to Apple's platform.The capabilities of the dual-camera system could also be enough
to make prosumer photographers choose to buy a new iPhone 7 Plus
instead of lugging around a bulky DSLR. Good for AAPL, bad for
Canon and Nikon …Apple is under pressure to deliver a killer feature that
kick-starts iPhone sales. 3D Touch didn't do it and the usual
playbook - thinner, faster and lighter - isn't enough to convince
existing iPhone users to upgrade, or to make much of a case for
switching from Android. However, by leveraging the iPhone camera as
a key strength, and taking a gigantic leap forward to DSLR-level
quality photos in the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL stands a good chance of
moving the needle on iPhone sales.Andthat'swhat the fuss is about with Apple's dual-camera technology.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in
  any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:Samsung Galaxy S7 Review: The Smartphone to Beat

Galaxy S7 Edge Review: Samsung Unleashes the Ultimate Android Smartphone;3/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a month sinceSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) unveiled the new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones at itsSamsung Unpacked 2016 event.Source: SamsungWhile considerable attention has been lavished on the Galaxy S7
-and rightly so, since it's Samsung's horse in the race to be the
best-selling smartphone of 2016- the Galaxy S7 Edge is also an
important release.makeArticleAd();In 2015, Samsung underestimated demand for its new dual-edge,
curved-screen smartphone, a move thathit the company's bottom line. Despite its price premium, consumers loved the Galaxy S6 Edge and
this year's version is dramatically improved, as Samsung looks to
capitalize on those willing to shell out big bucks for the ultimate
smartphone experience.8 High-Quality, High-Dividend Stocks to Buy for
    Q2The new smartphones have been on sale for several weeks now and
the reviews are rolling in. Here's our take on Samsung's stunning,
but pricey smartphone, the Galaxy S7 Edge.Galaxy S7 Edge Review: Bigger and BetterLast year's smartphone sales remained a disappointment for
Samsung despite a radical upscaling of its smartphone design,
switching to a premium metal-and-glass look. Running short of
Galaxy S6 Edges didn't help, but the Galaxy faithful were upset
about some of the changes that came with the new look.A major theme for this year was addressing those concerns, and
as a result, theGalaxy S7 seriesis water resistant, packs a much larger battery and regains
expandable storage using microSD cards.While the Galaxy S7 design was left largely unchanged, Samsung
made a big move with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Literally. This year the
Edge's dual-edge curved display grows from 5.1 inches to 5.5
inches, moving it into phablet territory.Despite the growth, it's only slightly thicker and heavier than
last year's model, while largely losing the camera bump on the
back. That back is also slightly curved, making it more
comfortable to hold than the model it replaces, despite being
larger.Compared to the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge is actually
slightly thinner, likely because there was more room in the larger
phone case to spread out the increased capacity battery.Say Goodbye to the Edge+?Last year, to complement the Galaxy S6 Edge, Samsung later
released a phablet-sized version, the 5.7-inch Galaxy S6 Edge+.With the new Galaxy S7 Edge display hitting 5.5 inches, having a
slightly larger version is going to do nothing but confuse
customers.Samsung hasn't said anything officially as yet, but now that the
Galaxy S7 Edge has gone super-sized and matches the size of rivalApple Inc.'s(AAPL) iPhone 6S Plus, expect the Edge+ to be on the chopping block.Galaxy S7 Edge Review: Specs5.5-inch, dual-edge Quad HD Super AMOLED display with Always
  On featureQualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU with 4GB RAM32/64GB storage with microSD card expansion support to

Edge takes everything Samsung's flagship offers - high performance,
expandable storage, thebest smartphone camera on the marketand water resistance - and adds the visual (and functional) punch
of the larger, dual-edge display.Samsung has learned from user feedback about previous Edge
models, and the Galaxy S7 Edge makes better use of its larger ""edge
panels.""The result is easily the most visually attractive Android
smartphone you can buy. That curved display and newly curved back
make it among the most comfortable to hold, too, despite its
considerable size.While the Galaxy S7 will get the job done in style, the Galaxy
S7 Edge is even more useful (thanks to that dual edge display) and
makes a bolder statement. Even with its $100 premium over the
Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge has the potential to sell in
significant numbers for Samsung and sets the bar high for this
fall's iPhone 7 Plus release.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a

This Is the Year of VR, Right? Maybe Not;3/29/2016;"Estimates vary, but by most accounts, 2016 is expected to be
    the year virtual reality (VR) goes mainstream.Facebook's Oculus Rift headset is being shipped to folks who
    pre-ordered the much anticipated device, and HTC's Vive headset
    will hit the streets a week later. Gamers, VR's initial
    marketing target, are all chomping at the bit to fully immerse
    themselves in the latest, greatest virtual game, stoking the VR
    expectation fires.So, what could go wrong?It turns out, while the tech community is clamoring to
    support VR -- there are twice as many developers focused on the
    platform than just a year ago -- consumers may not be quite
    ready to jump onboard. At first glance, the sky-high market
    estimates make sense, but according to a recent survey of 3,000
    U.S. adults, the VR hype is premature.makeArticleAd();Image source:Oculus.Survey saysDespite the hoopla surrounding Rift, Vive, andSamsung's Gear VR mobile device, among others, Horizon Media asked
    3,000 U.S. adults about VR, and ""fully two thirds of consumers
    are unaware of the [VR] technology."" That's a surprisingly
    large segment of the population unfamiliar with virtual
    reality, given the amount of press it has received.The two-thirds of uninitiated U.S. adults could represent a
    marketing opportunity for VR vendors, but it's also indicative
    of VR gaining more media attention than consumer interest: at
    least for now. The lack of VR knowledge among potential users
    hasn't prevented industry pundits from projecting explosive
    growth, however.One estimate puts the VR market at $30 billion in just four
    years. Other forecasts aren't quite as generous, but they still
    expect virtual reality will become a multibillion-dollar
    business by 2018. One thing that's common among the market
    estimates -- and that's borne out in the recent survey -- is
    that VR is at least a few years from really hitting its
    stride.More mountains to climbConsumers' lack of awareness is a concern, but the survey's
    most intriguing result was how many are willing to shell out
    the necessary funds to buy VR headsets. Of the men and women
    asked, a combined 36% said they were interested in purchasing a
    virtual reality device -- not exactly inspiring. And that's not
    the biggest hurdle to full-fledged VR adoption.Of those who were interested in a device, just 25% said they
    were willing to spend more than $250 to immersive themselves in
    a virtual world. That's fine with Samsung since its mobile Gear
    VR is an affordable $99 and requires nothing more than a newer
    version Galaxy smartphone. But penny-pinching consumers could
    prove to be the biggest hurdle for Facebook's, HTC's, andSony's new PlayStation VR console, which is expected to hit store
    shelves later this year.The money problem is twofold. First, the Rift is listed at
    $599, Vive at a whopping $799, and Sony's VR iteration will
    start at $399. Though for consumers without a console camera,
    another $100 is needed to enjoy Sony's VR experience. Gear VR
    is certainly affordable, but it isn't expected to provide the
    same level of immersion as full-fledged devices.The second challenge Facebook and HTC must overcome is the
    computing power needed to use the VR headsets. Today, less than
    1% of the world's 1.43 billion PCs have the juice needed to
    utilize Rift or Vive because of the graphics computing power
    required.Most PCs are set up to handle 30 image frames a second, but
    VR requires three times that processing power. To buy that
    power, consumers would need a $1,500 laptop, or to
    significantly upgrade existing PCs. Or, with the purchase of a
    Rift, Oculus can set VR users up with a $1,000 PC thanks to its
    ""special pricing"" bundle. Not exactly a bargain, either
    way.To no one's surprise, women aren't nearly as interested as
    men in VR. Gamers are largely male, and that's the initial
    target market for VR manufacturers. Until VR expands beyond the
    gaming community, the Rifts of the world will miss out on about
    half the population.Despite the challenges, virtual reality will become a
    significant market: just not as quickly as some pundits have
    forecast. For investors, virtual reality will still help drive
    revenue for Facebook, Sony, Samsung, and the others, but it
    appears more patience will be needed than originally
    thought.A secret billion-dollar stock

Apple's Reported 2017 iPhone Plans Could Mean Its 2-Year Upgrade Cycle Is Over;3/28/2016;"ByEric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech:KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been pretty accurate
  over the years (though not perfect) in reporting on Apple's
  (NASDAQ:AAPL) future hardware plans, states AAPLplans to launchan iPhone sporting a 5.8"" OLED display in 2017. He cautions the
  device could become a high-end add-on to an iPhone lineup that
  includes a 5.5"" LCD model if enough OLED panels aren't
  secured.Apple also is reportedly thinking of using front-and-back
  glass panels - save for the plastic 5C, every iPhone launched
  since the 4/4s has had an aluminum back panel. Kuo adds Apple
  could also use plastic or ceramic, but thinks glass is the most
  likely material choice.Also saidto be part of Apple's 2017 iPhone plans: Wireless charging
  integration and the inclusion of new biometric recognition tech
  such as face and iris scanning. Applerecently bought Emotient, an A.I. startup that developed technology for deciphering human
  emotions via facial expressions.makeArticleAd();Kuo's OLED and wireless charging remarks fit to an extent with
  recent reports. The Nikkei, Kuo, and Korea's Electronic Timeshave reportedApple is interested in launching iPhones sporting OLEDs, but some
  of the reports have pointed to a 2018 (rather than 2017) ETA.
  Bloomberg, meanwhile,has reportedApple is working with U.S. and Asian partners to develop
  over-the-air wireless charging technology that could go into
  iPhones as soon as next year. There's speculation (but no

  improving, migrating from LCDs to OLEDs feels like a smart move.
  OLEDs, long used by high-end Samsung (SSNLF) phones and gradually taking high-end TV share, can deliver
  better contrast/deeper blacks than LCDs. Moreover, the fact OLEDs
  don't need a backlight can potentially yield improvements in
  power consumption and thickness - two things that Apple's

  The iPhone 4/4s' glass back (in my subjective opinion) helped

  greater risk of the phone shattering when dropped, but the iPhone
  cover glass supplier Corning (NYSE:GLW)has improvedthe Gorilla Glass's shatter resistance in recent years and is
  also working onProject Phire, a solution that promises sapphire-like scratch resistance while
  maintaining Gorilla Glass's shatter resistance. Corning, of

  glass on its back rather than aluminum.(click to enlarge)The iPhone 4's rear glass panel.Source: Digital Trends.Notably, the hardware changes reportedly being considered for
  2017 iPhones appear much bigger than the ones that have beenrumored to datefor this year's expected iPhone 7 launches. Relative to the 6s/6s
  Plus, the biggest changes rumored for the 7 are a dual-lens rear
  camera that delivers better image quality and potentially enables
  optical zoom, and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack
  (headphones would be connected via Bluetooth or a Lightning
  port).That, in turn, suggests Apple is willing to depart from its
  standard iPhone hardware upgrade cycle, through which the company
  unveils a major design overhaul every two years, with smaller
  upgrades provided in the interim year.If such a strategy shift is occurring, it likely has much to
  do with the fact that - with its high-end models now sporting
  4.7"" and 5.5"" displays - it's tough for Apple to now have major
  upgrade cycles revolve around display size increases, as they did
  for the iPhone 5 and 6. Moreover, with phone subsidies and
  two-year service contracts (once the primary means of buying
  iPhones in the U.S. and certain other markets) increasingly
  replaced by installment and upgrade plans (including Apple's ownupgrade program), the incentive for linking a big iPhone overhaul with two-year
  contract expirations isn't as strong as it used to be.Major technology improvements, rather than display size
  changes, are now set to drive Apple's iPhone upgrade pace. And
  those improvements won't necessarily arrive every other year.See alsoWynn Vs. MGM: What Company Will Win This New Game

Samsung Galaxy S7 Review: The Smartphone to Beat in 2016 (SSNLF);3/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) had to be disappointed after the 2015 release of the Galaxy S6.
The company finally banished its low-rent plastic design for a
premium glass-and-metal look but still came up short in sales. With
theGalaxy S7, Samsung has improved last year's design to near perfection.Source: SamsungThis is the smartphone to beat in 2016.makeArticleAd();But will the latest Galaxy smartphone be enough to lift Samsung
out of its sales doldrums? Does it have the chops to take onApple Inc.'s (AAPL) mighty iPhone 6S, and will it be advanced enough to compete
against the iPhone 7 juggernaut when it arrives in the fall?8 High-Quality, High-Dividend Stocks to Buy for
Q2Key Improvements Over the Galaxy S6With the Galaxy S6, Samsung was praised for abandoning the
plastic body of previous Galaxies in favor of a premium
metal-and-glass look, putting Samsung's flagship smartphone on a
more even design footing with Apple's iPhones.Unfortunately, that change necessitated dropping some features
that Galaxy fans considered deal breakers - like support for SD
cards - and introduced some new problems. The sleek design was a
looker, but also difficult to grasp firmly.With the Galaxy S7, Samsung attempts to rectify those
missteps.The back of the Galaxy S7 gains a bit of curve instead of being
perfectly flat, making it much more comfortable to hold than the
Galaxy S6. The camera bump that first appeared in the Galaxy S6 is
also much less pronounced.The Galaxy S7 regains water resistance, with the ability to
survive splashes and even a short dunking.While Samsung didn't go so far as to offer the replaceable
battery previous Galaxy smartphones have had (that would be tough
to pull off in a waterproof case with tightly bonded glass and
metal), it did significantly boost the capacity of the battery in
the Galaxy S7.Finally, the ability to use a microSD card for cheap storage
expansion is back (it's hidden in the SIM card tray), but with a
caveat - Samsung chose not to support Android Marshmallow's
""adoptable storage,"" so the card isn't treated as system storage.
However, it works as traditional extra storage, so it can be loaded
up with files like music and movies.Finally, rather than its own Xynos processor, Samsung is
returning toQualcomm, Inc.(QCOM), using its flagship Snapdragon 820 CPU and tacking on an
additional gigabyte of RAM.Galaxy S7's New FeaturesThe Galaxy S7 is much more than just a spec bump and a few
fixes. There are new features, including a completely revamped
camera system that takes on one of the iPhone's key advantages:
photos.For years, Samsung has been pushing higher megapixels as beingthecritical measurement of camera performance. Despite its efforts,
the lower-pixel-count iPhone has consistently come out on top as
the preferred choice for snapping photos.With the Galaxy S7, Samsung gambled and adopted Apple's
approach, actually cutting the megapixel count compared to last
year by switching to larger dual-pixels, while also adding a larger
aperture lens.The result is dramatically better photos, with extremely rapid
auto-focus and excellent low-light results. MultipleGalaxy S7 reviewshave pitted its camera against the iPhone 6S andAlphabet Inc's (GOOG,GOOGL) Google Nexus 6P, and the Galaxy S7 is hands-down the winner when
it comes to taking high quality photos.Also new for this year is an always-on display.Samsung is taking advantage of OLED technology to have a section
of the Galaxy S7 display permanently active and showing key
information like the calendar, time and notifications.While this may use a little more power, the battery in this
phone is larger than last year and not having to power it up to
check this information means that in practice it has negligible
effect on battery life - it's a very handy feature, and something
the iPhone lacks.Galaxy S7 Key Specs5.1-inch Quad HD AMOLED display with Always On feature Qualcomm

charging compatible Weighs 5.36 oz, 0.311-inches thick Runs Android
6.0 (Marshmallow) with Samsung TouchWiz UI IP68 Certified water
resistant MSRP $699 unlockedConclusionThe Galaxy S7 was always going to be the Android smartphone to
beat in 2016.After all, despite the success of competitors like the Nexus 6P
and the growing threat of Chinese manufacturers likeHuawei, Samsung remains top dog. In 2015, the company soldmore than the next three top Android makers
combined, despite disappointing Galaxy S6 numbers.With the Galaxy S7, Samsung mostly rectifies the design flaws
introduced with last year's flagship while largely retaining its
stunning visual design. That should win back the Galaxy faithful
who may have skipped last year's upgrade. And rather than sit
still with basic feature progression, Samsung gambled on a major
camera redesign that forced it to back off on years of marketing
higher megapixel counts as being key to great pictures.As a result the Galaxy S7 is not just the best mass-market
Android smartphone, it's more than able to take on Apple's iPhone
6S.That leaves a few big questions for 2016.One: will the Galaxy S7's flagship price scare off Android
shoppers when strong competition like the $499 Nexus 6P cost
hundreds of dollars less?And two: is the sleek design, upgradable storage, water
resistance and superior camera enough to sway anyone from the
iPhone camp over the next five months?The new Galaxy S7 isn't perfect, but it is without a doubtthesmartphone to beat in 2016.At least until September, when the iPhone 7 will make its
debut.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a
  position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in Q2Why You WANT Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) to Get Smaller7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy and Hold for Q2 and

3 Possible Winners from the Apple Inc. iPhone SE;3/27/2016;"The iPhone SE in four colors. Image credit: Apple.Apple's latest iPhone, the iPhone SE, won't make it into customers'
    hands until March 31, meaning that investors probably won't get
    to see tear-down reports of the device until sometime after
    that. However, based on what Apple has revealed about the
    device, I think that the investment community can make some
    educated guesses as to the companies that could benefit should
    the iPhone SE do well based on the specifications of the
    device.makeArticleAd();Potential Winner: InvenSenseMotion processor vendor InvenSense did not win a spot inside of
    the 2013 iPhone 5S, but it did secure spots in both the iPhone
    6-series as well as the iPhone 6s-series of smartphones with
    its MP67B 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer solution.Although there is a chance that Apple has actually chosen to
    stick with theST Micromotion processor that was found in the old iPhone 5s , I
    think the odds are in favor of one from InvenSense. Indeed,
    Apple is buying the InvenSense parts in such high volumes to
    support sales of the iPhone 6-series and 6s-series of phones
    that it could be both simpler and cheaper for Apple to use
    InvenSense chips for the SE, as well.To the extent that iPhone SE sales take the place of
    would-be iPhone 5s sales, rather than cannibalize iPhone
    6/6s-series phone sales, InvenSense could stand to benefit.
    We'll have to see what the official tear-downs reveal,
    though.Potential Winner:BroadcomThe iPhone 5s came with an 802.11n Wi-Fi solution and a
    category 3 LTE modem. At the time of launch, these were hardly
    leading edge solutions, but they were ""good enough"" for the
    time. The new iPhone SE comes with an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio as
    well as a slightly faster category 4 LTE modem.Broadcom should benefit from this in two ways. Firstly, the
    802.11ac radio is almost certainly a higher-value component
    than the 802.11n radio found inside of the iPhone 5s. Broadcom
    should benefit from the inclusion of a higher-value Wi-Fi
    solution in Apple's entry-level iPhone.Broadcom also provides RF chips into the iPhone and it is
    likely that the RF content required to support the faster
    category 4 LTE modem is greater than that required to support
    the slower category 3 LTE modem in the iPhone 5s.Potential Winner(s): Memory MakersThe iPhone 5s came with just 1 gigabyte of now-old LPDDR3
    memory. The iPhone SE, on the other hand, packs 2 gigabytes of
    faster, more efficient, and likely more costly to-Apple LPDDR4
    memory. This would suggest that Apple's memory suppliers are
    poised to benefit from this increase in memory content.Typical iPhone memory vendors have traditionally been SK
    Hynix,Samsung, andMicron. I suspect that all three will ultimately seesomebenefit from the increase in memory content in the iPhone SE
    vis-à-vis the iPhone 5s (and, to the extent that the SE
    cannibalizes them, the iPhone 6-series).3 companies poised to explode when cable
      diesCable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to
      explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally
      bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone

Sony Corp. vs. Facebook Inc.: The VR War Is On;3/23/2016;"Electronics giantSonywas the hit of last week's Game Developers Conference 2016 in
    San Francisco after it took the wraps off its much-anticipated
    virtual reality solution, the PlayStation VR. The VR market is
    becoming crowded with a host of big-time players vying for what
    is expected to be a huge market in the coming years, so it
    would be easy to discount Sony's efforts  when compared toFacebook's soon-to-be-shipped Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, or
    HTC's Vive.But Sony is taking a slightly different tack with its VR
    solution. Rather than creating a standalone headset ala the
    Rift or Vive, the gaming behemoth intends to focus on its
    millions of existing PlayStation console owners. Sounds like a
    good plan, given there are already 37 million plus PlayStation
    4 units in gamer's homes. But thanks to a partnership between
    Facebook and Sony's primary gaming console competitor,Microsoft, its new VR solution still faces an uphill battle.makeArticleAd();Image courtesy ofOculusLet the games beginSony's soon-to-be released PlayStation VR has one feature in
    its favor where it beats the two other big boys on the VR
    block: price. The Rift headset, scheduled to begin shipping
    later this month, will cost gamers a hefty $599 (not mentioning
    the price of the high-end computer they'll need to connect it
    to). But even Rift is ""cheap"" compared to HTC's Vive which will
    set consumers back a whopping $799.At $499, Sony's ""Launch Bundle"" comes with everything a
    PlayStation 4 owner will need to exit reality for a while. For
    the cost conscious, Sony also offers a ""core bundle"" that
    includes the VR headset, cables to plug it into the gaming
    console, headphones, and a demo disc for $399. The additional
    $100 for the complete VR package tosses in a PS camera, motion
    controllers, and a VR game called ""Worlds.""Sony began taking pre-orders for its launch bundle Tuesday,
    and it's scaled-down VR offering becomes available next week.
    Unfortunately for Sony, though gamers canordera PlayStation VR now, they'll need to wait until October before
    shipments begin. With Rift just about to hit the virtual
    streets, and HTC's Vive scheduled to begin shipping early next
    month, those who wait for Sony's entry will face about a
    six-month lag time.What's at stakeBy most accounts, 2016 will be a so-so year for VR as consumers
    slowly begin climbing aboard. Still, market estimates suggest
    there will be several billion dollars at stake this year. But
    2017 will be an entirely different story, with the VR market
    expected to surpass $15 billion in revenue, and double to about
    $30 billion by 2020.In the VR wars to come, one factor is likely to work against
    Rift and Vive: computer system requirements. Though Oculus and
    HTC will both be available long before Sony's PlayStation VR,
    both require a level of computing power most consumers' current
    machine won't be able to provide. One study estimates that a
    mere 13 million PCs have the graphics power to support a Rift
    or a Vive. That's equal to less than 1% of the world's 1.43
    billion PCs.This computing power deficit is one reason pundits expect
    that Sony's PlayStation VR and mobile solutions like the
    Oculus-developed Gear fromSamsungwill be the early VR leaders. That makes Rift's deal with
    Microsoft a possible game-changer, and could give Facebook an
    early advantage over Sony and HTC.It took some folks by surprise when Facebook announced it
    had inked a deal with Microsoft to include an Xbox One wireless
    controller with each Rift. But considering the concerns about
    the computing requirements of the Rift as a standalone device,
    both Facebook and Microsoft stand to benefit.The Xbox One's popularity certainly hasn't matched
    that of Sony's PlayStation, but with an estimated 18 million
    units in consumer's hands, it still represents a big
    opportunity for the Rift to gain an upper hand in what is sure
    to be a hard fought battle for VR supremacy. At $800, Vive may
    have priced itself out of the running before the battle even
    begins.That leaves Rift and PlayStation VR as the favorites. Rift's
    early introduction and alignment with Microsoft give it a leg
    up, but don't discount the power of Sony's existing 37 million
    PlayStation owners.A secret billion-dollar stock

Facebook Investors Should Ignore Oculus Rift -- for Now;3/23/2016;"For $600, consumers get the Oculus Rift headset, a game
    controller, remote, and sensor. Image source: Facebook.2016 is shaping up to be the year of virtual reality.It's a market and a technology that remains in its infancy,
    but several companies seemed poised to dominate, most notablyFacebook. The social network will launch its first piece of consumer
    hardware, the virtual reality headset Oculus Rift, on March 28.
    Initial impressions of both the Oculus Rift and the technology
    in general have been positive, and excitement is starting to
    build. Research firm Tractica projects that sales of virtual
    reality headsets will top 200 million within the next four
    years.makeArticleAd();That may sound exciting for potential Facebook investors,
    but Oculus isn't likely to affect Facebook's business anytime
    soon.Not material in 2016Facebook CFO Dave Wehner addressed the Oculus Rift on the
    company's earnings call back in January. In short, it won't
    matter -- at least not this year."" ... the expected shipments of Oculus Rift ... [the]
      impact [will] be immaterial to our overall total expenses for
      the year ... With Rift, it's really ... early in the
      evolution of VR. It's early to be talking about large volume
      ... it's not going to be material to our financials this
      year.""Facebook's revenue grew 52% last year on an annual basis,
    and management expects similarly strong growth in 2016. But
    that growth will be generated by Facebook's advertising
    business -- not its hardware. ""We expect the factors that drove
    the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will
    continue in 2016,"" Wehner said.Priced at $600, the Oculus Rift is expensive, and given that
    it requires an expensive PC to function, its total cost of
    ownership exceeds $1,000. In time, the technology will become
    more affordable, but not for several years. The market for the
    Oculus Rift in 2016 will number -- at most -- just a few
    million headsets. In a recent interview withDie Welt(via Business Insider), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that it could take
    at least 10 years to build a vibrant virtual reality
    ecosystem.2 other stocks that could benefitOther companies should see more dramatic effects on their top
    and bottom lines in the near term as the demand for virtual
    reality accelerates.NVIDIAandSamsungcould both reward shareholders.NVIDIA provides the powerful graphical processors needed to
    make PC-based headsets like the Oculus Rift function. Last
    year, there were only 5.9 million discrete graphics cards
    shipped worldwide, according to Jon Peddie Research. That
    amounts to a mere fraction of the larger PC market, which
    totaled more than 276 million shipments, according to IDC. If
    the Oculus Rift is going to take off, then there's going to be
    a lot more demand for discrete graphics cards going
    forward.NVIDIA derives the bulk of its revenue from its GPUs, and,
    more specifically, GPUs aimed at PC gamers -- the sort of
    consumers most likely to purchase the Rift. Last quarter,
    gaming-related revenue accounted for more than 84% of NVIDIA's
    total revenue. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang discussed the
    potential for virtual reality at length during the company's
    most recent earnings call. Given the still high barriers to
    entry, he offered no hard figures, but said it could provide ""a
    really nice bonus"" going forward.Samsung has partnered with Facebook for its own virtual
    reality headset,the Gear VR. To be clear, the Gear VR can't provide experiences on par
    with the Oculus Rift (or its other high-end competitors), but
    it is far more affordable. If you own one of Samsung's flagship
    smartphones, it will cost you just $100. Other
    smartphone-makers have unveiled competing headsets in recent
    weeks, but Samsung has steadily built up an ecosystem around
    the Gear VR, with dozens of exclusive games and apps. So long
    as the cost of high-end, stand-alone headsets like the Rift
    remains high, Samsung can offer consumers something unique. And
    given that the Gear VR relies on Samsung's smartphones to
    function, demand for the headset could provide a modest boost
    to Samsung's smartphone sales.Of course, investors with longer time horizons may prefer
    Facebook. Oculus Rift is just one device in a sea of competing
    products, and it's hard to know how the market will ultimately
    shake out and who will wind up on top. But if you already like
    Facebook for its growing advertising business, its virtual
    reality aspirations provide interesting upside.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you

DSP Group: Undiscovered Semiconductor Gem With 77% Upside Potential;3/22/2016;"ByCobiaman:DSP Group (DSPG) is a little known innovator in the semiconductor industry. The
  company dominates the market for audio chips that fit into
  cordless phones with 80% worldwide market share. The cordless
  business is the company's cash cow needing little incremental
  investment and throwing off lots of cash. According to the
  company's 2015 10-K, the Home business, the vast majority of
  which is the cordless business, did $122 million in revenue in
  2015 and generated $25 million in profit.The company's first growth business is its mobile segment. In
  this segment, the company sells chips that go into watches and
  mobile phones where they perform audio functions such as ambient
  noise suppression and voice recognition for voice commands.
  DSPG's edge is that its chips draw much less power than its
  competitors, which is very important to phone and watch makers
  who want to extend battery life as long as possible. It has been
  a long road for DSPG in this market as it has been working on
  these chips for three years without any significant market
  traction.In the past six months, however, the company has garnered two
  major design wins that will in and of themselves be large revenue
  generators but will also give the company increased credibility
  with other potential customers. The first was with the Samsung (SSNLF) Gear S2 watch. This is a lower volume win as the category is
  still nascent but provides some revenue and was a beachhead into
  Samsung. As has been revealed by recent teardowns, a DSPG chip is
  also present in the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S7. The
  Galaxy S7 comes in two versions; one with a Qualcomm Snapdragon
  processor and the other with a homegrown Samsung Exynos
  processor.makeArticleAd();Current thinking is that the DSP chip is only in the
  Snapdragon version which is being sold in the US and China. If
  you assume 20% of roughly, 50 million S7 units are sold with DSP
  chips at $1 ASP per unit, then you get a $10 million per year
  revenue stream to DSPG from this model alone, which is in line
  with the company's guidance. This compares favorably with the
  zero revenue that this segment did in 2015.The company is now engaged in discussions with other Android
  phone makers who often follow Samsung's lead when it comes to
  adding components to their phones. For comparison purposes, there
  was a public company called Audience that did $160 million in
  revenue in 2013 from this type of business alone. That gives you
  some idea of the upside that is possible from this segment.The next segment that DSPG operates in is the office segment.
  Here the company sells chips that go into Voice-over-IP business
  phones, which is about a $200 million addressable market. The
  company did $20 million in revenue in this business in 2015 and
  has guided to 50% growth in 2016. There is a favorable business
  dynamic here as the two market share leaders in the space,
  Broadcom and Texas Instruments, are both getting out of the
  business and DSPG is taking advantage through market share
  gains.The company also has a play on the Internet of Things in the
  home. It has a low-power communications technology that it
  derived from its cordless business called Ultra Low Energy ((ULE)) that has superior characteristics versus most competing home
  technologies. While small last year (about $4 million in
  revenue), this is potentially a very large market should the
  company gain traction here.Finally, the company recently introduced a new product called
  the Spark PA, which is a power amplifier designed to go into next
  generation Wi-Fi access points. This is a standard CMOS part so
  can be produced less expensively than the current generation of
  SiGe and GaAs parts. Besides its cheaper cost, the part also
  outperforms the competition, setting it up for traction in the $1
  billion market for these devices.After a solid first half of 2015, the cordless business
  suffered a weaker second half and guided to a very weak Q1 2016.
  In addition to fluctuations in end demand, this market has also
  suffered historically from inventory buildups and reductions in
  the distribution channel. This combination has led to lots of
  volatility in DSPG's cordless business over the years. Management
  believes that what it is seeing for Q1 is a combination of weaker
  end demand plus distributors reducing inventory. Investors have
  taken the stance that this is a worsening of the normal rate of
  decline in this business from 10% to 20%. I think this negative
  view is currently the base case for the stock and if the business
  does come back, it will be upside for shareholders.So what is DSPG worth? The company currently has a market cap
  of $200 million with $122 million in net cash. The growth
  business will have an aggregate revenue of about $50 million in
  2015 and be growing at close to 70%. There are no public comps
  growing that fast but with slower growers valued at 3x sales, I
  think 4x is a reasonable multiple for these businesses. For the
  cordless business, I think 0.5x sales is fair. Finally, you get a
  free option on Spark PA, as it is tough to value at its nascent
  stage. So,$122 million in net cash4 x $50m = $200m for the growth businesses0.5 x $122m = $60m for the cordless business$362m for everything vs. a $200m market cap today$15.63 stock price target meaning 77% upsideSee alsoS&P 500 Valuation Dashboard - Updateon seekingalpha.com"

Apple Inc. (AAPL): What the New iPhone SE Has in Store – And More!;3/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace
  - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) just wrapped up its ""Let Us Loop You in"" event, and as expected,
the company took the wraps off a brand new iPhone - the 4-inchiPhone SE.Source: AppleBesides the new iPhone, Apple also is releasing a new, smalleriPad Pro-effectively replacing the iPad Air in its tablet lineup - and new
Apple Watch band options. The company also announced key software
updates foriOS,watchOSandtvOS, boosting the capabilities of its mobile devices, theApple Watchand theApple TV.makeArticleAd();Before getting to the good stuff, CEO Tim Cook took the
time to make a couple of quick notes, including …Apple celebrates its 40th birthday on April 1 The company currently
boasts more than 1 billion active devices. He also took the
opportunity to pitch Apple's stance on iPhone privacy versus the
FBI. Apple's environmental credibility was also pushed, as it
closes on the goal of having all AAPL facilities running on 100% on
renewable energy, with recycling of old iPhones ramping up. Apple
Health also got a shout out, with ResearchKit's contribution to
various national health studies shown off in a film clip featuring
medical professionals and researchers.But the headliner was the new, smaller iPhone SE. Here are the
details of that, as well as the other products AAPL announced
and provided new details on:iPhone SEAs expected, Apple introduced a new iPhone. TheiPhone SEfills an important niche for AAPL, targeting consumers who prefer a
smaller screen, or have budget constraints.Apple's iPhone SE Will Be a Stopgap, Not a
SaviorThe company sold more than 30 million 4-inch iPhones in
2015, but the iPhone 5s is old. The new iPhone SE, however,
combines a 4-inch display with current hardware. The look is the
iPhone 5s with nods to the iPhone 6s, offering the iPhone
flagship's processor in a smaller package.The iPhone SE supports ""Hey Siri,"" offers the latest 12-MP
iSight Camera and even comes in a Rose Gold option. It supports
Apple Pay, but not 3D Touch.The price starts at $399, giving Apple a true mid-range phone
(64GB goes to $399).Pre-orders start March 24 with shipping on March 31.With rivalSamsung(SSNLF) launching its new Galaxy S7, it also doesn't hurt that Apple
takes some of the media spotlight with the new iPhone SE.9.7-inch iPad Pro Replaces iPad AirWith iPad sales continuing on a downward spiral, it was time to
think different. So Apple decided to stop relying on fickle
consumers - who have proven reluctant to regularly update their
tablets - and instead go after the professional, business and
prosumer market with its latest new iPad.It was pointed out that manyiPad Prousers came over from Windows. With over 600 million PCs that are
over 5 years old, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro is being
positioned as the affordable way to get into a modern convertible
laptop device.Apple is calling it ""the ultimate PC replacement.""The new iPad Pro offers the advanced features of the original,
including Apple Pencil support, the A9X CPU, premium Oxide TFT
display and Pro accessories including a Smart Keyboard and SD card
reader in a smaller, more affordable package.However, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is more expensive than the iPad
Air, starting at $599 (with 32GB of storage). A 256GB version is
available for $899.AAPL starts taking pre-order for the iPad Pro on March 24, with
shipments starting March 31; the iPad Air 2 will remain in the
lineup for now as a more affordable option (with its price dropped
to $399) for consumers who want something larger than the iPad
Mini.Apple WatchWhile there was a chance that AAPL would release a followup to
itsApple Watchsmartwatch, that was always a long shot. Ithasbeen a year since the original was released, but bets are consumers
won't be on board with yearly upgrades.However, the companydidtake the opportunity of using today's Apple event to refresh the
Apple Watch lineup through the release of new Band options: woven
nylon, new Sport and Leather color options, and a new Space Black
Milanese Loop Band.And, perhaps most notably, AAPL dropped the Apple Watch starting
price to $299.Software UpdatesToday's Apple event also saw several important software updates
announced.CareKitis a new tie-in to Apple Health that makes it easier for developers
to create apps that focus on caring for health issues, letting
patients be more involved in their own care, using their iPhone.tvOSis getting an update today with enhanced Siri functionality, making
it easier to search and enter text on the Apple TV. Also getting an
update isiOS. The new iOS 9.3 -which is now available- includes features like
Night Shift (to combat night-time eyestrain and sleep issues), a
new Education feature preview, improved Maps and CarPlay.Want to learn more about the new iPhone SE? Look for in-depth

Refuting an Unfair View of Intel Corp.’s Potential Apple Inc. iPhone Win;3/21/2016;"Intel's XMM 7360. Image credit: Intel.Regular readers of my columns are quite aware of my
    frustration withIntel's execution in the world cellular modems and smartphone
    applications processors. Even as rumors swirl that the chip
    giant's struggling modem business is set to reel in a big fish
    in the form of as much as 40% of the modem spots in the
    upcomingAppleiPhone, I remain skeptical of such a win for what I believe to
    be good technical reasons.makeArticleAd();Nevertheless, despite this frustration and skepticism, I
    cannot help but view recent comments around this potential win
    from analyst Chris Danely as, frankly, unfair.Danely thinks that this will contribute nothing to
    earnings per shareAccording to Danely, this business ""would contribute zero
    [earnings per share] due to 0% or worse operating margins.""I just can't see his reasoning here.Intel has already sunk the research and development dollars
    associated with brining to life its XMM 7360 (the modem that
    Apple would use if it were to choose an Intel part) and has
    indicated that it will continue to invest in a modem roadmap.
    There is likely to be minimal additional/special investment on
    the modem technology front associated with a potential Apple
    iPhone win.Since the vast majority of the research and development
    spending on Intel's modems has already been spent and would
    likely have been spent with or without Apple, it doesn't make
    sense to say this would not contribute to earnings per
    share.In fact, the only realistic scenario in which I could see
    this product having a ""zero"" contribution to earnings per share
    would be if Intel is handing the modems over to Apple virtually
    at manufacturing cost. Given Intel's big focus on trying to
    improve the profitability of its mobile efforts, ""giving modems
    away"" doesn't seem to fit in with the company's current
    strategy.Icontinue to believethat if Intel wins this deal, I expect it to be accretive to
    gross profit and ultimately to net income.Danely's argument around foundry seems strangeIn the same note, Danely apparently claims that Intel would be
    better served trying to penetrate the mobile/wireless market
    via foundry. On the surface, this seems reasonable, but in
    reality this is a strategy that is unlikely to work.The major foundries --TSMCandSamsung-- are already shipping superior products than what Intel has
    managed to build on its own manufacturing processes for the
    smartphone and tablet markets.To be quite blunt, Intel does not have a track record as a
    third party foundry. Intel ended up outrightbuyingits highest-profile foundry customer which, as we've recently
    learned, has seen significant delays in completing the design
    of its first Intel-built FPGA.Until investors see a lucrative, high-volume foundry win for
    Intel, it doesn't seem prudent to assume that Intel could just
    waltz in and easily win foundry business. Even former Intel
    foundry Chief Sunit Rikhi indicated in an interview with
    Semiconductor Engineering that having compelling technology
    gets the chipmaker seats at the discussion table but doesn't
    necessarily mean that it will ""walk away with contracts.""We'll see how this plays outI'm not convinced that Intel has even won the iPhone 7 and look
    forward to tear-downs to see whether it won the spot or not.
    However, if Intel has won, I am confident that it will be
    positive -- even if just slightly -- for the chip-maker, not
    negative or neutral.3 companies poised to explode when cable
      diesCable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to
