The search engine giant is as relevant as ever, and its targeted advertising model is a favorite for advertisers and marketing teams.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNear a yearly high and at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 31 times, the company faces no headwinds. Competition fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is hardly a concern, even after GOOGL's weak Google+ offering.Alphabet's Electronic Money BusinessGoogle's Gmail for the web now allows for sending money from within the Android app. This could threatenPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).For now, though, PayPal need not worry. Google users may not even know about this money-transferring features. PayPal's branding is so solid that it, along with investors, should not expect an erosion in its business. So, Google Wallet, and evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, have too little of the market share in electronic payments at this time.Still, GOOGL's foray in this business is a necessity. It cannot rely entirely on advertising for all of its revenue.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsDespite Google and Facebook dominating the digital advertising space, Google's reliance on ad clicks is a clear risk. In the fourth quarter, the company faced higher hardware costs, as itinvestedin the new Pixel phone, Daydream View Virtual Reality and Google Home.But the good news is that Google's revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $26.06 billion allows the company to invest. Investors are hardly worried: the stock bottomed at the $800 per share range on Feb. 1 and has surged over $860 a share.Increasing ad content to grow profit margins brings risks for GOOGL shareholders. Google's search results will worsen if it continues pushing too many paid ads or its own services before it connects the user to the proper search results. Just do a search for a ""car,"" The search results display at least five ads before the useful results show up below them.

The more frustrating the user experience, the more likely users will start abandoning Google.com in favor ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing or DuckDuckGo.Growth in MobileGoogle's focus on high-end hardware, notably the Google Pixel phone, ensures the company is at the forefront of mobile. Google Assistant is the key software solution in the hardware. And it lets GOOGL stock continue its development in AI solutions. Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri are the competitors to the Assistant.Pixel is still in the early phases of hardware development. Since Google puts an emphasis on the user experience, future iterations will only offer a better experience. So this will result in users spending more time using Assistant, Google Search, and other Google apps:""In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users.

How Many Vehicles Will Tesla, Inc. Deliver in Q1?;3/20/2017;"Next week,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will close its first quarter. That means the   electric-car maker will soon share its total quarterly vehicle   deliveries.Ahead of Tesla's first-quarter update on vehicle deliveries,   here's a close look at what investors know.Tesla vehicles outside of Tesla factory. Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();A wildcard quarterTypically, Tesla investors have some solid visibility into   potential vehicle deliveries for a given quarter. But there's   much more uncertainty surrounding this quarter's possible   deliveries than usual, as Tesla opted to only provide guidance   for the first half of the year -- without specifying what it   expects for the first quarter.For the first half of the year, Tesla said it expects to   deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined,   up 62% to 72% compared to same period in 2016.Investors also know that Tesla ended its fourth quarter with a   record 6,450 vehicles in transit to customers, setting the   company up for a strong start to the quarter. Tesla also said   demand for its vehicles is looking up; orders for the Model S and   Model X combined were up 49% year over year and were 24% higher   than any other quarter, management said.But even this information still leaves lots of room for   guesswork since quarterly deliveries can also be influenced by   the timing of shipments to different regions, as well as by   production challenges. The best ballpark figure investors can   arrive at for estimating Model S and Model X deliveries in the   first quarter, therefore, is one that simply cuts Tesla's   forecast for the first half of the year in half. Assuming Tesla   delivers half of its 47,000 to 50,000 estimated units for the   first half of the year in Q1, it would imply 23,500 to 25,000   deliveries during the quarter -- up from 22,252 deliveries in the   fourth quarter of 2016 and 14,820 units in the first quarter of   2016.Investors should look for Tesla's first-quarter deliveries to   be between about 23,500 and 25,000. But since this estimate is   extrapolated from guidance for a broader period, investors   shouldn't be surprised if actual deliveries deviate from this   estimate. If deliveries do come in below or above this level,   investors may want to look into a reason for the variance.Look for an update on demandBeyond Tesla's reported deliveries in its upcoming update,   which is usually released within three calendar days of the   quarter's close (anywhere between April 1 and April 3), investors   may want to look for an update on demand for Model S and Model   X.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.In Tesla's quarterly update on deliveries, the company has   recently been sharing data for orders of the two vehicles. In its   update on fourth-quarter deliveries, for instance, investors   learned that Model S and Model X deliveries were increasing   sharply year over year and were at an all-time high.A look at demand levels for Model S and Model X during the   first quarter would be timely since Tesla is preparing to bring   to market its $35,000 Model 3 in the second half of the year.   With a starting price about half of Tesla's more expensive Model   S and Model X, there's good reason to be concerned about Model 3   cannibalizing sales of Tesla's two older, pricier models.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Buy Because of Their Eccentric CEOs;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen deciding which stocks to add to your portfolio, it's important to assess things like a company's financials, its growth plans and who its competitors are.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrHowever, most investors also put a lot of stake into a company's upper management because they are, after all, the ones calling the shots. CEOs have a lot of sway over a company's future, so many investors keep a close eye on who is at the helm and how they're impacting the firm's bottom line.The management style of a firm's CEO is an important factor in its success and while calm, cool and collected tends to be the most desirable trait to investors, there are a few eccentric CEOs that are just crazy enough to make things work.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotElon Musk ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), Jeff Bezos ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Michael O'Leary ofRyanair Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:RYAAY) are three such CEOs whose out-of-the-box personalities have brought their respective firms a great deal of success.Eccentric CEOs: Elon Musk,Tesla Inc (TSLA)As CEO and founder of electric car company Tesla, Elon Musk, is one of the first people that comes to mind when thinking about mega-successful eccentric CEOs.Musk is well known using colorful language and not shying away from speaking his mind, especially when it comes to talking about competitors. However, while Mr. Musk can sometimes becontroversial, you've got to give it to him for thinking big and executing those plans. His decision to create a TSLA Gigafactory in Nevada appears to be paying off.According to Musk, Tesla is on-track to build 500,000 new vehicles in 2018.Eccentric CEOs: Jeff Bezos,Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Jeff Bezos is the CEO and founder of e-commerce giant Amazon and although he flies a bit further under the radar than Musk, he still found himself at the center of controversy when the corporate culture at AMZN came under fire last year.Former employees claimed that intense pressure and competition made their working environment unbearable, but Bezosshot backsaying that his firm's culture promotes risk-taking and sets high standards, which is a key reason why Amazon has been so successful.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeWhether you agree with the way AMZN treats its employees, you've got to admit that whatever they're doing over there, it's working. Amazon has created an undeniably exceptional service that has hooked millions of people. The company's continued expansion and innovation makes Amazon an attractive stock to buy and hold and Bezos' high expectations should give shareholders confidence in the company's future.Eccentric CEOs: Michael O'Leary, Ryanair Holdings plc (ADR) (RYAAY)Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is perhaps one of the most polarizing CEOs on the planet. You either loathe or love his outlandish remarks and no-holds-barred comments, and I fall in the latter camp.O'Leary doesn't shy away from having an opinion and he has always been upfront about RYAAY's mission - safety and profits, profits, profits. While many have criticized his intensecost-cutting measures, the airline has become synonymous with low-cost flights. O'Leary's willingness to speak unfiltered to the press has given the airline a lot of free publicity.RYAAY has done well because of that- the company was able to thrive despite a financial crisis in Europe and has grown to become one of the largest airlines in the world. The company's profits have been nothing short of impressive over the last few quarters, and although the impact of the Brexit is likely to take its toll, RYAAY is likely to weather this storm successfully.Love him or hate him, O'Leary delivers for shareholders and his flamboyant remarks are constantly generating buzz for Ryanair.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long RYAAY and AMZN.The post3 Stocks to Buy Because of Their Eccentric CEOsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and Beyond;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is going to $500. At least, that's the word according to Iou1000, a message board participant at Seeking Alpha. ""Again the shorts need a bear [market] or something untoward happening to Elon Musk to make money - Otherwise Tesla will make a new high on the way to 500,""Iou1000commented on TSLA stock on March 20, 2017.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)TSLA stock closed trading Mar. 17 at $261.50, 91.2% less than $500, halfway to a G-note. Assuming the prediction is on the money - when does it get there, and more importantly, how?There are three answers to this question, in my opinion, the first being the best option for TSLA stock blowing past $500 on its way to $1,000.TSLA Needs to Be ProfitableIt's a simple concept but one that investors have grappled with since TSLA stock startedtradingon June 29, 2010. Since then, it has amassed $2.4 billion in operating losses and $17 billion in revenue. That's an average of $343 million in annual operating losses and $2.4 billion in annual revenue for a 14.2% negative operating margin.It has never made money on an annual basis, not even with the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits it sells from time to time as a result of producing emission-free vehicles. In Q3 2016 it did make a $0.71 per share non-GAAP profit, but that included$139 millionin ZEV credits sold during the quarter. Without the ZEV credits according to UBS lead auto analyst Colin Langan, it would have been a $0.18 loss.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeFuture earnings are what ultimately drive stock prices.If Tesla could simply generate positive free cash flow on an annual basis, it would be more than enough ammunition for the bulls that TSLA stock was worth owning at $500 and beyond. Of course, it doesn't - negative free cash flow in 2016 of$1.4 billion- hence the line in its 2016 10-K:""Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles.""That's exactly what Tesla did recently when it raised$1.2 billionin cash - $350 million in new equity and $850 million in senior convertible notes - to pad the amount of capital available to bring the Model 3 to production.Blowing past $500 would be a lot more of a sure thing if it started making some kind of a GAAP-like profit. Until then, you're going to have a lot of skeptics. That's just the nature of the beast.TSLA Stock Is a Winner If Model 3 Is a SuccessThe honeymoon is over.Elon Musk has said that it will produce5,000Model 3s' per week in the fourth quarter of 2017, ramping up to 10,000 per week in 2018. At 400,000 pre-orders it will likely fill that pent-up demand sometime in 2019.Skeptics point out that Tesla has only delivered 183,000 vehicles over the last five years, making this kind of production increase fraught with risk. If Tesla can't meet the pre-order demand in a timely fashion, the odds of the Model 3 becoming a big commercial success decrease exponentially putting significant downward pressure on TSLA stock and ultimately, Tesla's long-term viability.""While we are bullish about Tesla's long-term potential, we have several near term concerns, most notably (1) gross margins, as Model 3 and its associated capex ramps up, and (2) Tesla's overall customer experience - which we believe is not strong today - and could be further pressured as the company migrates to selling to a more mass-market consumer,"" a Bernstein analyst recentlywrotein a note to investors. ""A poor ramp and customer experience on Model 3 could not only impact Tesla's near-term financials, but undermine the franchise longer-term.""The positive in all of this is that Tesla is said to be already making ""release candidate"" versions of theModel 3, eliminating the costly ""prototype"" phase, which suggests the company's ability to get concept vehicles into production in a timely manner will continue to improve in the future. This bodes well for its future vehicles and the Model 3.Model YCar companies are known to use a single platform to produce several different vehicles in one production facility. Tesla is said to be introducing itsModel Ycrossover SUV sometime in 2018; it's a vehicle that could be built on the same platform as the Model 3. If so, the cost of producing the Model Y would drop significantly helping to point its way toward GAAP profitability and automotive mass production.BofA Thinks FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here's Why.We don't even know if the Model 3 is going to be a hit, but a smooth rollout later in 2017 should pave the way for strong demand of the Model Y.Bottom Line on Tesla StockIn December, IsuggestedTesla stock belonged in one's IRA, albeit that it shouldn't represent more than 5% of your plan. The reason: TSLA stock is still a risk despite all the good things happening at the company.Frankly, I think Tesla stock gets to $500 by this time next year, because by then we'll know if the Model 3 is a success or failure. When it starts making money, and that's a bigif, $1,000 will look like chump change in the scheme of things.Unfortunately, there's a lot of water to go under the bridge yet. If you're long, I'd stay long. If you're short, good luck to you, and if you don't own TSLA stock, I wouldn't get overly aggressive in your purchases until its future is a little more clear.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe post3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and Beyondappeared first onInvestorPlace."
Tesla Inc (TSLA) to Stop Selling Cheapest Model S;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) will stop selling the cheapest versions of its Models S next month.makeArticleAd();Source: TeslaTesla Inc will stop selling the Model S 60 and 60D on April 16, 2017. These versions of the Model S come with a 75 kWh battery that is limited to 60 kWh by software restrictions. The company says that most customers chose to buy the additional upgrade that unlocks the full 75 kWh.Due to most customers choosing toupgrade to the 75 kWh option, Tesla Inc is removing the Model S 60 and 60D from its list of available vehicles next month. This decision comes as TSLA prepares to launch its next electric vehicle, the Model 3.The Tesla Model 3 is expected to only cost around $35,000 and may include a battery pack below 60kWh. However, the test version of vehicle that the company has is powered by a 70kWh battery pack.

Tesla (TSLA) to Discontinue Model S 60 Sale from April;3/20/2017;"Tesla, Inc.TSLAhas recently mailed its customers informing them of the discontinuation of the sale of the entry level Model S vehicle, according to sources. The company has decided to remove the Model S 60 and 60D from its lineup. The last day to buy the 60 kWh version has been set at Apr 16, 2017. Post the date, the entry level Model S sedan will be S 75 and 75D, priced $6,500 higher. Late last year, the company had raised the price of its Model S vehicles by $2,000.A Cheaper Model STesla had introduced Model S 60 and 60D versions last year. The cheaper version was introduced as the company experienced a higher-than-expected demand for Model 3 as well as immediate demand for a more affordable Model S. These versions were introduced to boost sales which in turn would encourage the adoption of electric cars. The Model S 60 kWh version has the same battery as the 75 kWh version. However, a software limits the battery usage to 80%. Customers have the option to upgrade the battery to utilize the entire capacity by unlocking the software for $9,500.During the introduction of this version, Tesla had expected demand for Model S to increase and subsequently the customers would also pay for unlocking of the 60 kWh version for the addition 15 kWh. The company expected gross margins for the sale of the locked version to be 15−20%. However, if customers unlocked the software, the margin was expected to rise to the mid-20% range.Tesla has claimed that most customers who purchased the Model S 60 kWh version unlocked the software to 75 kWh. To ease the ordering process for consumers, the company has decided to eliminate the 60 kWh version. Another reason for the removal of the version from the company's vehicle lineup could also be to boost the gross margins if the rate of upgradation fell short of expectations.Model 3 on the CardsThe announcement comes at a time when Tesla is preparing to begin production of the Model 3, which will be the company's most affordable vehicle. The price of the model will be less than half of the new entry level Model S. Model 3 is expected to have a battery smaller than 60 kWh but versions offering higher performance will be priced more.The discontinuation of the 60 kWh Model S also widens the gap between the two models, which would differentiate Model S as a higher-end model. Moreover, customers would be less confused about the model choice owing to a significant price difference between the two.A Rerun of EventsEarlier, Tesla had taken similar decisions on its Model X SUV. The company introduced a cheaper 60 kWh Model X version, with limited battery usage from the 75 kWh by a software which could be upgraded. However, four months after the introduction of the version it was discontinued.The removal of the more affordable Model X increased the base price of the vehicle from $74,000 to $88,800 per unit.PerformancemakeArticleAd();Tesla has outperformed the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last three months.

BofA Thinks FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here’s Why.;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFireEye, Inc.(NASDAQ:FEYE) is flying high Monday morning on an upgrade from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. FEYE stock got a 6%-plus pop as BofA shares a ""Buy"" rating and an $18 price target - a whopping 70% better than Friday's close.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)It's hard to be inspired right now. Bearishness has been rightfully high because valuations - relative to future growth - are unfavorable. Management shuffling and a light forecast from FEYE also suggests that FireEye will have limited upside for investors in the near-term.But BofA sees what I see - that in the long-term, FEYE stock could pan out.The FundamentalsLast month, FireEye reported flat (year-over-year) fourth-quarter revenue growth of $184.7 million. Operating margins improved to -1%. The company forecast Q1 revenue of as low as $160 million, while analysts expected FEYE would generate $177 million in revenue.8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market CrashThe company clearly is in a turnaround phase, but until the sales team transition stabilizes, short-term pains in FEYE stockwillcontinue.Last quarter, FireEye revenues suffered due to the limited release of new products. Its sales team had vacancies that needed filling, leaving a massive gap in leadership. But the company had no head of sales for the worldwide or Europe divisions. The company's Middle East and Japan units underwent sales management transitions, too.The impact on results is very clear: FireEye did not meet analyst expectations.Investors may anticipate sales improving sometime in the next few quarters, depending on the productivity of the new sales team. Fixing the internal sales process will result in better profitability. On its conference call, FEYE management said:We are also working across the board to minimize the number of deals that go through our non-standard pricing process, or NSP process, so partners can control their margin and shorten their sales cycle.FEYE has a believable plan to turn around and restructure its sales division. The problem is simply one of timing.FireEye ValuationWith the stock price hovering near yearly lows, some, if not all, of the risks of a failed turnaround are priced into FireEye shares.By assuming a discount rate of between 11.5%-12.5%, FEYE stock is worth 12.5% more than current levels. Conversely, if revenue continues falling, the fair value based on future cash flow implies a lower share price. BofA doesn't see that as happening, though.""We think the Street largely ignores management's guidance for growth resumption in 2H17, which is an opportunity for a positive surprise,"" says analyst Tal Liani.There's headline support here, too. The demand levels for cybersecurity solutions is unpredictable. Whenever the public hears about a security breach, though, the news drives the stock price up. Markets anticipate that companies addressing security holes will buy solutions from FEYE.Bank of America seems to back that up, saying that FireEye's threat intelligence is the most advanced offering out there. From the note:""FireEye's core value proposition is centered around having some of the most advanced threat intelligence that lends its value to three areas of innovation: dealing with network threats, strong position in endpoint protection and above all is the value of analytics and threat management.""Product DevelopmentFireEye's public, hybrid and private cloud security solutions are among the bricks upon which FEYE stock could be built back up.Bank of America seems to back that up, saying that FireEye's threat intelligence is the most advanced offering out there. From the note:""FireEye's core value proposition is centered around having some of the most advanced threat intelligence that lends its value to three areas of innovation: dealing with network threats, strong position in endpoint protection and above all is the value of analytics and threat management.""The Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid enhances endpoint security for customers, FireEye Helix unifies the security experience for organizations. By offering a lower cost of ownership and cutting operational expenses for customers, Helix may reverse FEYE's weakening business.Why I Sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock (And You Should Too)BofA lists ""New products: cloud MVX, Smart grid, Helix, enhancements to FireEye-as-a-Service and the next gen endpoints"" as one of its bullish arguments.Adobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are great examples of companies moving from out-of-the-box software sales and towards cloud subscriptions. Revenue growth is slow at first, but when it picks up, profitability soars.Radcom Ltd.(NASDAQ:RDCM), a supplier of quality assurance solutions for the telecom industry, also moved towards a subscription model with great success.Bottom Line on FEYE StockLast month, rumors thatSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) would buy FireEye proved short-lived. Symantec is already absorbingBluecoatSystems. It does not need the operational risks related to adding FEYE's cybersecurity solution to its suite of products.Still, FireEye does offer detection capabilities. Even if it's not a right match for Symantec, though, it's priced cheaply enough that it could be easily ingested by many conglomerate tech stocks.FireEye's mini-rallies hold some truth: The market views the company's potential are still unrealized. A buyout would unlock the value of the company.Better yet, having a stabilized sales team with lower turnover and developing new cloud-based products will reverse the downtrend in its stock.FEYE stock is a buy, though the real upside potential (70% or not) could take a bit to reach.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGeneral Electric Company (GE): Should Nelson Peltz Just Quit?Monday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc.

Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.61, while the 10-day moving average edged lower to 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) saw increased dividend speculation following CEO Brian Moynihan's annual letter to shareholders. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) continued to see speculation surrounding capital expenditures heading into the launch of the Model 3, whileSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) plunged following a bearish note from Moffett-Nathanson.Bank of America Corp (BAC)Bank of America has been itching to raise its dividend for some time now. But, with Fed approval needed to lift its own dividend, the company has placed its hopes on President Donald Trump's promise to lift banking sector regulations.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsOnce BofA gets the go-ahead on either front, it is just a matter of time before the company's dividend moves higher.

Ahead of Its Model 3, Tesla to Discontinue Cheapest Model S Version;3/19/2017;"In emails sent to customers last week, electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) warned potential customers interested in its base   60 kilowatt-hour Model S -- which is the cheapest version of the   fully-electric sedan available and has a starting price of   $68,000 -- that April 16 would be the last day to order the   vehicle.A discontinuation of the 60-kWh Model S would increase the   pricing gap between Tesla's upcoming $35,000 Model 3 and Tesla's   pricier Model S -- a move that would help further distinguish the   Model S as a higher-end option for customers.Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();The 60 kWh variant's spotty historyTesla's 60 kilowatt-hour Model S has a rollercoaster   history.As one of Tesla's initial battery configurations available for   customers to choose when Model S was first launched in 2012, the   battery capacity was ditched in 2015 fora new 70 kWh entry-level Model S.Last summer, however, Teslabrought back the lower-capacity option, as customers reportedly expressed interest in buying the   vehicle if the price were slightly lower. The value proposition   was arguably more aggressive when Tesla brought back the 60 kWh   Model S. This variant actually sported a 75 kWh battery, which   customers could upgrade to via a software update for a fee at any   time.And now Tesla is ditching the 60 kWh variant yet again. The   company says the move was made because most customers were   upgrading to the 75 kWh version anyway. Furthermore, by removing   the upgradeable 60 kWh option, Tesla says it will ""simplify the   ordering process"" for its customers.Is Model 3 the real reason?But there's also good reason to believe the discontinuation of   a 60 kWh Model S could have just as much to do with Tesla's   upcoming Model 3. With the company planning to begin production   of the lower-priced version in July, a fully optioned Model 3   could easily come close to Tesla's $68,000 starting price for   Model S, creating some confusing choices for customers.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.For instance, if Tesla charges an additional $10,000 on top of   the Model 3's $35,000 base price for a larger battery capacity   option, and if customers pay for Enhanced and opt for about   $15,000 worth of additional upgrade options, this could easily   get a highly optioned Model 3's price close the base 60 kWh Model   S. And if Tesla offers several battery upgrade options, Model 3   pricing could rise to $70,000 or more.As Tesla's planned production for Model 3 approaches, the   company likely wants to be sure that Model S is differentiated   from the Model 3 as a higher-end option. While the larger overall   size of the Model S will likely play an important role in   differentiation, Tesla will probably need more factors than this   to truly set the vehicle apart as the company's flagship   sedan.Looking ahead, Tesla expects Model 3 to help total annual   vehicle production rise from about 80,000 units in 2016 to   500,000 units in 2018. While management has said it expects Model   3 to drive most of this growth, there's no indication it expects   the more expensive Model S and Model X sales to fall as Model 3   deliveries take off. It's likely, therefore, that Tesla will make   significant efforts to further differentiate its Model S from   Model 3 as production ramps up. The discontinuation of Tesla's 60   kWh Model S is likely just the first of many such moves.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Inc.'s Capital Expenditures Could Soar Nearly 200% This Year;3/18/2017;"On Thursday, electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) followed through on CEO Elon Musk's recent   commentary regarding a likelycapital raise to reduce riskassociated with rapidly increasing spending for its ambitious   growth plans. Tesla said it would raiseabout $1.15 billion.As Tesla raises cash in preparation for a big jump in   spending, it's a good time to take a look at how much the   company's capital expenditures could go up this year.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.makeArticleAd();Big plans, lots of cashIt's no surprise that Tesla needs a lot of capital. The   company has some very ambitious plans for Model 3. With the help   of a higher-volume, lower-priced Model 3, management expects its   annualized production to increase from about 100,000 units today   to a whopping 500,000 units in 2018.But exactly how much cash will Tesla need? A lot more than it   did last year. Here's what we know.With plans to begin production of its upcoming Model 3 in   July, Tesla expects capital spending during the first half of the   year to rise sharply as it lays the groundwork for production.   Management guided for $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital   expenditures in the first half of the year alone -- an amount   that easily trumps the $1.3 billion it spent during the entire   year of 2016 on capital expenditures.What about the second half of the year? While Tesla didn't   provide guidance for expected capital expenditures then, since   management is focused primarily on initial investments   required to get its upcoming Model 3 to volume production, Musk   did recently imply that Tesla anticipates spending to come down   during the second half of the year.Here's what he said during the fourth-quarter earnings   call:I mean, there's obviously going to be ... incremental     investment to go from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week,     but it's going to be a lot less than getting to 5,000 cars a     week in the first place. We don't know exactly what that's     going to be except I'm confident it will be less ...Musk went on to conclude he wouldn't expect capital spending   in the second half of the year to exceed 70% of its spending   during the first half. Therefore, assuming spending in the second   half of the year maxes out at about 70% of spending during the   first half, investors can arrive at a ballpark estimate for   Tesla's total capital spending in 2017: approximately $3.825   billion -- up an incredible 194% compared to capital   expenditures in 2016.Gigafactory and Model 3 are Tesla's biggest     investmentsHow will this spending be allocated? Unsurprisingly, mostly on   investments related to ramping up production of Model 3 (and   batteries for the Model 3 at the Gigafactory).Tesla Gigafactory as of Jan. 3. Image source: TeslaAs CFO Jason Wheeler explained during Tesla's fourth-quarter   earnings call:So we don't break down and we don't disclose the specifics     here, but obviously, Gigafactory and Model 3 are going to be     the biggest investments. We've also got CapEx investments in     equipment and tooling related to Model 3. But then also,     there's going to be a piece in CapEx on building out our     service and our retail infrastructure as well and the     Supercharger network. So it's the usual suspects.So, while it does expect Model 3 to drive significant growth,   Tesla won't be escaping the capital-intensive nature of the auto   business. Investors should keep an eye on the company's spending,   looking for it to pay off with outsized growth in the   business.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model S Prices Are About to Go Up;3/18/2017;"Following a $2,000 price bump in November, the price ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S is about to go up even further. That's   because the company is preparing to discontinue the current   entry-level 60 kWh model, including both the single-motor version   as well as the dual-motor version that costs an extra $5,000.   Tesla has sent out emails notifying customers of the change, andElectrekconfirmed the plans with Tesla. The last day that prospective   customers can purchase the 60 kWh version will be April 16,   2017.Tesla says it is making the change because most customers   subsequently purchase the upgrade to a 75 kWh battery, which is   unlocked via a software update, and the company is streamlining   the ordering process. Assuming no other pricing changes, the   single motor 75 kWh Model S starts at $74,500.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Following in Model X's footstepsThe discontinuation of the Model S 60 comes shortly after   Tesla made similar moves with the Model X last year. The   electric-car maker introduced a more affordable 60 kWh version of   its Model X SUV (only available in dual motor) in July 2016,   which was similarly a 75 kWh battery pack that was   software-limited to 60 kwh and started at $74,000. That variant   didn't last long, as it was discontinued in October 2016, just   four months later. Tesla never provided an official reason. The   Model X 75D starts at $88,800.The software-limited 60 kWh Model S lasted a bit longer, as it   was also introduced slightly earlier than the comparable Model X,   but it appears to be following in the Model X's footsteps.Why is Tesla doing this?The software-limited approach has been controversial from the   very beginning. On one hand, there was initial backlash at the   idea that customers were being needlessly prohibited from   accessing the full battery capacity of a product they had paid   for. On the other hand, they paid a lot less for a software   limited 60 kWh pack.From Tesla's perspective, there was a certain amount of risk   associated with the approach, since it was still including 75 kWh   of capacity, which comes at a cost. The hope was that the lower   price point would attract more buyers, who would later upgrade.   If the customer is content with 60 kWh and never upgrades, Tesla   ends up taking a meaningful hit on margins.On the earnings call shortly after the software-limited 60 kWh   pack was introduced, CEO Elon Musk said that most people that   were buying the base 60 were optioning up to where average   transaction prices were ""over $80,000,"" while acknowledging lower   margins:Because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up     being decent. I mean it's not...maybe it is 15% to 20% gross     margin whereas say something, like if somebody orders the     performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%,     35% gross margin. But there's just a small number of people     that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay triple     digits, or six digits I should say. But it also remains to be     seen how many who order the 60 then choose to do the upgrade to     75 kilowatt hour rate.There is going to be some number, it's too early to tell, of     people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and     then they can just order it kind of like an in-app purchase on     the car screen and unlock it. I suspect we will see a pretty     decent number of people do that. But we don't, it is still very     early, so it's hard to say what number that would be. And if     they do do that, then it would push gross margins up into the     20s [percent], like mid-20s [percent] or something.For reference, Tesla's adjusted automotive gross margin last   quarter was 22.2%, which was down sequentially due to delayed   Autopilot-related software updates; the company said it   recognized ""almost no new Autopilot-related revenue"" during the   quarter.Tesla's justification that the move is meant to streamline   ordering doesn't pass the sniff test. More than likely, the S 60   is being discontinued for financial reasons, if the upgrade rate   is lower than Tesla had previously anticipated. A large   concentration of non-upgraded 60s with a 15% to 20% gross margin   could put pressure on profitability, while discontinuing the   option pushes the margin on those vehicles to the 20% to 25%   range with the potential downside of losing some customers who   aren't willing to pay more.Hopefully, the margin upside offsets any lost sales.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Business Model Innovation Will Help Make Make Energy Storage Work;3/18/2017;"Energy storage is coming to closer to a reality for hundreds   of thousands of residential energy customers, and we still don't   know how companies are going to sell it to them. A battery system   could be purchased or leased, and a customer could make money off   it through a revenue-sharing program, or some kind of service   model that maximized its value to customers. If you look back to   2010, when the residential solar market was in a similar   position, it was the business model that separated the winners   from the crowd. And it was companies offering leases to customers   on a large scale who were early winners.We do know that residential energy storage is expected to be a   multibillion-dollar business by the end of the decade, we just   don't know what business model will work for energy storage   companies. And whoever can get the business model right will be   in a nice position for investors.Tesla's Powerwall on a home. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The national installer modelA number of companies are trying to leverage their residential   solar footprint to expand into energy storage.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the largest of these after its acquisition of   SolarCity, andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) is another player worth watching.Tesla's early Powerwall models were sold directly to customers   with the main justification being backup power. But as costs come   down and rate structures with demand charges or time-of-use rates   become more common, we'll see more financial justification for   energy storage, and new business models will open up.National installers will also likely try to fold energy   storage into a long-term energy contract for consumers. Sunrun is   doing this with its Brightbox lease, which matches its focus on   solar leases. Marrying the two together could keep the lease   alive and give national installers new life.The dealer energy storage modelI should also note that national installers are losing market   share because the lease is quickly losing popularity. I think   that will lead to a service-oriented dealer model opening up.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is an example of a company who uses dealers,   providing equipment and services, but leaning on the dealer to   complete sales and perform installations.In energy storage, SunPower may provide a pre-engineered   solution that plugs directly into its solar systems as well as   financing and some sort of value-generation model. A customer may   buy the energy storage system and then share the revenue   generated with SunPower. It may lease and share value, similar to   the national installer model I outlined above. Or it may just   sell the system and provide the algorithm that controls the   system for a fee.The third-party energy storage modelOne growing model is having energy storage as a stand-alone   service, not tied to a solar system's financing. Sonnen is one of   the industry leaders in Germany, where energy storage has been   viable for years now, and is moving quickly to grow in the U.S.   as well. In total, the company has installed over 10,000 energy   storage systems around the world.Sonnen's system is designed to work with a solar system in the   U.S., but it wouldn't necessarily have to be combined with solar.   Sonnen can even aggregate excess energy from a community energy   program, effectively creating an energy sharing program.Buying solar and energy storage separately is what's normally   done in commercial solar, with companies like Stem taking the   lead on energy storage and only having an adjacent involvement   with solar. This model could potentially make sense as a business   model in the residential market as well, although it would be a   harder sell than marrying up with a solar system.What we know energy storage needsYou may notice that all of the models I outlined above have a   large company behind the scenes pulling the strings, and that's   important. A small company doesn't have the scale to build the   algorithms needed to know when charging and discharging an energy   storage system would generate the most value. And in different   states and areas under different utilities with different rate   structures, the decision-making process would be different.   Companies need scale and the ability to control thousands of   energy storage systems to aggregate the value.While big players may be power brokers behind the scenes, it's   still not clear how the model will interact with customers. The   solar market is moving toward more cash and loan sales and away   from leases from national installers, so that's worth keeping in   mind if energy storage is tied directly to solar. But the need   for a large company to generate value from energy storage may   pull large companies back into the mix, whether that's   manufacturers, or on the installation side.Whoever can get this formula right will have a huge market   ahead of them. And the energy storage market is coming quickly   and may open up a lot faster than investors think.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Go Long the Super Story In Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently shared winning trades inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The most recent was along TLSA upsidetrade, and earlier I suggested investorscatch it as a falling knife. They both brought me fast profits, so I now need to reset another.makeArticleAd();Source: Tesla MotorsThe financial fundamental story in TSLA almost doesn't matter. So-called financial bad news has been a temporary source of downside pressure. Take the recent capital raise for example; its anticipation brought about worry which was reflected in price action, then once the event passed, Tesla stock rallied.The overall fundamental picture for TSLA stock is one that is bifurcated - there are haters versus life-long devotees. I fall in the middle as I am not a fan of its prospects but I strongly believe in TSLA buyers. All I need to know is that they will step in to support the stock after falls.TSLA is a dominant player in batteries, especially for the auto industry. To complement that, they also have a tie into the solar space.Although combustion engines are still the norm, e-cars have been gaining ground.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsFor the next few months, TSLA stock is a bad short idea. Bears cannot disprove the upside story in Tesla's claims. They are concepts with long-term milestones. This usually creates a negative headline vacuum, levitating the stock. Elon Musk also publicly recommitted to staying there for the long term, so that risk is low too.Click to EnlargeNot all TSLA stock fans will buy it at the same level; hence the chop in its price action. I have been successful in selling risk behind lines where most Tesla bulls would buy. Today I look to repeat performance, but for the long term. My schedule will be hectic for the next few months, so I want positions that are relatively low maintenance.TSLA Stock TradeThe Bet:Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $145 put for $4 per contract or better. This is a bullishly biased trade. I need Tesla stock to stay above my sold put - otherwise I am committed to buying shares at $145 even if it falls much lower.For a less aggressive stance, I can modify the bet into a credit put spread instead.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $150/$145 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade for which I collect 60 cents per contract. I have a 90% chance that TSLA stays above my sold risk to yield 11% on risk.

Tesla, Inc. Raises $1.2 Billion in Offerings;3/17/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) priced its concurrent stock and convertible note   offerings last night, and the total capital raised came in at   $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.15 billion that Tesla   had previously expected even after a 15% underwriter option. That   $1.2 billion is the gross amount raised before factoring in   underwriting discounts and other costs associated with the   offering, some of which are not insignificant.The total amount raised could climb to $1.4 billion if   underwriters exercise all options. We'll find out in a few days   if they do or not.Tesla factory in Fremont. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The equityIn terms of the common stock offering, it was priced at $262   and Tesla ended up selling 1.33 million shares, compared to the   969,000 it initially planned to sell. Underwriters still have   options to purchase another 200,000 shares on top of that if   investor demand is there. The net proceeds to Tesla after the   underwriting discount are about $348 million. That puts the   dilutive impact of the stock offering at 0.8% -- rather   minimal.The stock offering is pretty straightforward, while the   convertible note offering is where things get a little bit more   interesting and complicated.The convertibles are pricing in more riskThe convertible notes due 2022 ended up pricing at a 2.375%   coupon rate, with an aggregate principal amount of $850 million,   up from the prior expectation of $750 million. The net proceeds   to Tesla will be $840 million after the underwriting discount.   The notes will have a conversion price of $327.50, which   represents a conversion premium of 25% compared to current   levels.Compare those figures to Tesla's last convertible note   offering from 2014 (underwriters exercised their options in full   on that offering).MaturityPrincipal AmountInterest RateConversion Premium2019$920 million0.25%42.5%2021$1.38 billion1.25%42.5%Data source: SEC filings.The higher interest rate and lower conversion premium   associated with the current offering show that the market is   pricing in more risk associated with these notes. It's possible   this is related to the recent acquisition of SolarCity, since the   deal weakened Tesla's balance sheet, as it assumed quite a bit of   its sister company's debt; Tesla had $2.7 billion in total   long-term debt and capital leases at the end of Q3, which jumped   to $6.8 billion at the end of Q4 after closing on SolarCity (not   including solar bonds).Additionally, Tesla is entering into hedge and warrant   transactions to offset and mitigate any potential dilution should   the notes be converted. But these transactions areexpensive. Tesla says it expects to spend $131.5 million of the note   proceeds to cover the costs of these hedges, which will only be   partially offset from proceeds from the warrant transactions.   That's a high price to pay, but the alternative is for   shareholders to face even greater potential dilution if shares   exceed the conversion price of $327.50.In other words, Tesla is spending about 15% of the net   proceeds from these notes on the related hedges, so it will only   collect about $708.5 million.Model 3 production is only four months awayIf we add up the net expected proceeds from both offerings,   after deducting the hedge expenses but before the possibility of   underwriters exercising their options, Tesla will add $1.06   billion to its coffers to help reduce risk ahead of Model 3,   which covers a good chunk of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in   capital expenditures that are planned for the new vehicle. With   Model 3 still on track for production to begin in July, it's   crunch time.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock: Your Time Is Running Out;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was a niche player in its early days, focusing on graphic processing units (GPUs), or graphics cards. That was way back when, before several NVDA stock splits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn the early days, there were big players likeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM) that all made chip sets for GPUs. And they still do.But Nvidia madereally high-endGPUs. Gamers loved them. Research labs and universities loved them. NVDA carved out a solid business but was never given much attention since it was a niche and no matter how many geeks bought its GPUs, it wasn't going to be a major player by dominating that sector.Nvidia then did what successful, out-of-the-box companies do. It looked out years in the future and decided to set a course to a new industry - visual computing.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt bet that as computers got faster and broadband delivered more information faster, that visual computing would become a major part of computing for decades to come. And NVDA was right.Now, the market cap for NVDA stock is bigger than all but the biggest players in the market - INTC andTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). Because its tech is so advanced, it also has partnered with a number of companies to add their components into devices and machines built for others. It's like car companies that feature a premium sound system or designer interior.It now looks like NVDA'snewest GPU is now on track to steal AMD's GPU's lunch. Also, its GPUs were selected to be in the newestNintendo Co., Ltd. (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY) gaming devices. And both of these come on the heels of a very bullish Q4 and full year earnings report for NVDA.Oddly enough, the stock sold off on the release, which is certainly a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" kind of thing, because there was no reason for the selloff. And even after the selloff, NVDA stock is up 212% in the past 12 months.What's more, the stock has already crossed back over the psychologically important $100-a-share mark.This recent performance indicates that traders sold the news, took some profits and are now back in for the next leg up.What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Needs to Make ANY Waves From HereI wrote about NVDA last monthafter its fall from its lofty heights around $120 per share, and now it looks like the momentum is now behind the stock again, as predicted.Don't let its price-to-earnings ratio of 41 deter you. Nvidia's growth almost makes that a reasonable valuation, and even if it's slightly expensive, it's less of a premium than you see on many stocks with a lot less growth potential.With a market leading position in the biggest trends in computing - big data, virtual reality, augmented reality, internet of things, smart cars and other devices - NVDA is in the catbird seat. It's still not too late to get in while its still consolidating.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

3 Reasons to Love Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Stock;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAbbott Laboratories(NYSE:ABT) is up 17% up so far this year and is beginning to look more like its old self. From early 2011 to the middle of 2015, ABT stock expanded from just $22 per share to over $50. Since that high, Abbott has been going sideways. The current run leaves Abbott at its highest point since the mid-2015 peak.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrWhile some analysts believe Abbott stock is going to cool-off because of its recent run, I believe in its prospects going forward.Abbott has an impressively diverse portfolio, solid growth on tap and an enviable dividend history.Here are three reasons why you should still pursue Abbott Laboratories as astock to buy, even with the gains it's already booked this year.ABT Has Strong Sales GrowthAbbott has a wide-ranging healthcare portfolio full of names consumers and medical experts alike are quite familiar with. Heard of Pedialyte and Pediasure? That's Abbott. Need generic pharmaceuticals for hypothyroidism or  Ménière's disease? Abbott. Need a vaccine for the flu? Abbott. That strong portfolio is one driver of growth for the company.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsWhile earnings have shrunk by 15% annually over the last half-decade, a double-digit annual expansion is expected for the five years looking forward. Sales growth is in part to thank - this year, sales are expected to expand by 25%.Abbott Is Acquisition SavvyThat sales growth is in part thanks to Abbott's recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a medical device company that further rounds out the healthcare giant's portfolio. According to the company's most recent earnings release, Abbott now holds the first or second positions across several cardiovascular device areas.Abbott also recently announced that it willnotfollow through on its acquisition of Alere. I like the fact that Abbott is willing to pivot in the face of what it sees as eroding value, and believe certainty around the acquisition (okay, well, the lack thereof) is good for investor morale.ABT Stock DividendIn addition to offering organic growth, Abbott also rewards loyal investors with a dividend. The company has paid a dividend for 373 straight quarters - a streak that dates back almost a century! On top of that, it's increased the payout for 45 straight years.As the company noted on its website, that makes Abbott a member of theS&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for 25 consecutive years.A Tesla Inc (TSLA) Cash Raise Gets ... A Hero's Welcome?That gives ABT stock a yield north of 2.3% even in the wake of its recent run. You can bet that yield will grow with more increases.Abbott stock's run so far this year is a solid base for further gains. While the 2015 peak may serve as resistance down the line, I think it will be easy climb until that point.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Better Buy: Tesla vs. BMW;3/17/2017;"In the high-end performance segment of the auto industry,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andBMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) are two of the best brands and most innovative   manufacturers in the world. BMW has long been an aspirational   brand focused on high performance with a level of luxury that   consumers demand when spending upward of $100,000 on a vehicle.   Tesla is breaking all of the rules of the auto industry and is   growing its fleet of electric vehicles.But investors have to balance growth with performance and   value in a stock. And with BMW and Tesla, those factors collide   amid a passionate debate about the future of the auto   industry.The electric BMW i3. Image source: BMW.makeArticleAd();The known commodityBMW is the better-known company of these two, having sold 2.37   million vehicles in 2016 and generated 6.9 billion euros in net   income for the year. Its EBIT (earnings before interest and   taxes) margin of 8.9% is among the industry's best, and   management has guided for 8% to 10% EBIT margin through 2020.What BMW brings from a manufacturing and quality standpoint is   extremely valuable, even though those are less tangible factors   than financial results. The company has decades of   manufacturing expertise and has been able to generate strong   margins while staying at the forefront of new technologies like   carbon fiber, autonomous driving, and electric vehicles (EVs).   It's even launched a ride-sharing product in Seattle, with   Portland (Oregon) and Brooklyn expected to follow.The advantage investors have with BMW is knowing that it can   execute on its automotive manufacturing plans and having   confidence in its ability to follow industry trends where they're   headed. With EVs clearly growing as a percentage of auto sales   around the world, BMW can learn and adapt to where the market is   going. But it'll be able to follow upstarts like Tesla as they   grow the market rather than being on the bleeding edge of a new   industry.Tesla's Model S with the first Powerwall. Image source:     Tesla.The upstart with a lot of unknowns aheadTesla has gotten the most attention of any EV company, and for   good reason. It's pushing the envelope, and its EV-only business   model seems to be the most effective way to build a viable EV   brand. And with energy storage and solar power under its wing,   the company has broad and diverse exposure to renewable   energy.All of that growth comes at a cost, though, with Tesla   spending $1.28 billion on capital expenditures in 2016. Goldman   Sachs recently predicted that 2017 capital expenditures would be   $3 billion to build out capacity to build the Model 3 and ramp up   to capacity for 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Plus, the company needs   to fund raw materials for building out the Model 3.The allure of growth is intoxicating, but it comes at high   risk as well. Analysts already expect Tesla will need to   raise capital in coming months to fund its growth plans. And the   company certainly needs to improve quality and its parts supply   chain just to match competitors (for evidence of this, read   fellow Fool Evan Niu's saga abouttrying to get his Model S repaired). Improving manufacturing quality and building out an   international parts supply chain is no small task, and it's   something Tesla has never done, so it's an unknown for the   company and leaves a lot of uncertainty for investors.Tesla's products are well liked by early adopters, but   still haven't been tested by the masses. While BMW sold over 2   million vehicles last year, Tesla has only sold about one-tenth   that figure in its nearly 14-year history. Translating hype to   operational success could prove harder than Tesla can handle.Why it's hard to pay up for potential in the auto   industryGiven the unknowns facing Tesla, it's hard to justify paying   10 times the price-to-sales ratio investors are getting with BMW.   And keep in mind that Tesla would have had to increase deliveries   by 31 times just to match BMW in 2016.BAMXF Market Capdata byYCharts.Maybe the more fundamental question is whether or not the auto   industry, and big players like BMW, will be able to adapt to   Tesla if the latter's success continues. And I'll point out that   progress in the auto industry is extremely slow. Tesla seems like   an upstart, but it's nearly 14 years old and is still making   fewer than 100,000 vehicles per year. That's not much of a track   record, no matter how good the company's brand is, and I think   automakers will quickly be able to catch Tesla in the EV   market.The fact that investors have to pay a massive premium to own   Tesla's shares is the main reason I think BMW is the better stock   to own today. There's more stability, a longer track record, and   we know BMW can be a world-class manufacturer -- something Tesla   still hasn't proven to investors.10 stocks we like better than BMWWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Are Chipmakers So Interested in Autonomous Cars?;3/16/2017;"It's the same reason that automakers are interested in the market. Although for them, it's also a question of preventing tech companies from encroaching on their turf. There doesn't seem to be any likelihood of such encroachment however, at least in the near future, as there is too much to making a car that's just too far from what tech companies do best. So the first fully-autonomous cars that make it to the market will most likely be a collaborative effort between auto makers and tech companies.The primary selling point for self-driving cars is increased safety due to fewer accidents. There has been some research suggesting that when computers take over the roads, they will remove the chances of accidents due to human error (for sleep, distraction, intoxication, carelessness, brake failure or other mechanical problems, or when it's the other guy's fault, or any other reason). And of course this is what is broadly propounded by the companies invested in the phenomenon. Kathy Winter, the VP and general manager of the automated driving division at IntelINTCthinks that it will also help create logistics solutions for transportation and delivery of products.But don't expect a sudden jump from driven to driverless cars. It's more likely that cars will increasingly incorporate features that automate certain functions over time, making them semi-automated to varying degrees. Regulatory and insurance considerations will also likely require the presence of a driver long after cars become fully-automated.The Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, recently conducted a survey of forty experts including policymakers, researchers, government representatives, nonprofit organizations and tech companies, presenting the results in a report titled ""3 Revolutions: Sharing, Electrification, and Automation."" The chief findings were as follows:70% of survey participants think fully driverless vehicles   will account for more than 20% of vehicles sold by 2040.88% think commercially offered shared rides will make up more   than 5% of all U.S. passenger miles by 2030, and 78% think   commercially offered shared rides will account for more than 20%   of U.S. passenger miles traveled by 2040.70% also think that by 2050, the majority of vehicles used   commercially for ride and car sharing in the nation will be zero   emissions vehicles, including battery, plug-in hybrid, and   fuel-cell electric vehicles.According to IHS Automotive forecasts, several thousand autonomous vehicles will be on U.S. roads in 2020, with the number growing to nearly 4.5 million vehicles by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles on the road globally, growing at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035.No wonder everyone is excited.What's In It For Chipmakers?Both Intel and NVIDIANVDAsay that the fully automated car will have as much electronic horsepower as a super computer.Whether a lidar or radar system is used to pick up images of the area surrounding the car, the system is based on semiconductors. These images have to be processed and matched with relevant data to decide a course of action at the blink of an eye. So there's processing (analog, logic), communications and machine learning involved. Each of these operations will be facilitated with semiconductors. Plus there's entertainment, displays and syncing with other devices that will also require semiconductors.Key PlayersThe Intel Go computer and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are designed to help cars detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is testing the Intel solution while TeslaTSLAis testing the NVIDIA solution. BaiduBIDUis developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, etc for the Chinese market.NVIDIA has a lead in the machine learning segment and its automotive chips are already in millions of cars from a number of suppliers, which in combination, gives it an edge in the automated car segment.Intel has been in collaboration with Mobileye for quite a while and has finally announced that it will buy the Israeli supplier of self-driving technology (camera and laser-based sensors) for $15 billion. Mobileye currently sells its technology to 27 automakers across the world, so the combination will be highly advantageous for Intel.QualcommQCOM, which beat Intel hands down in the mobile computing business, is also set to rule in self-driving cars (although this time, competition will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA having gained some mileage). The company recently launched its Drive Data Platform, which is its version of a self-driving system to process the sensor inputs generated by a vehicle. The system is based on the Snapdragon 820Am and makes use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE).But there's more. Qualcomm's soon-to-be-completed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion brings on board NXP's RF SoC for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that exciting in the context of self-driving cars, the thing to bear in mind in this case is the SoC technology that will shrink the size of high power systems while lowering the cost.This will be quite a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adoption of its systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automotive chips worldwide so it has the necessary relationships to jumpstart its business.AlphabetGOOGLhas developed self-driving technology of its own but its component suppliers aren't known. Back in 2015, the company quietly acquired Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors including an optical accelerometer, a vibration energy harvester and a ""Time Domain Switched"" type of inertial sensor for $85 million. Lumedyne also had a number of patents pending approval at the time.Over the years, Google has also been hiring a growing number of people with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google's Pixel team advertised an opening for a ""multimedia chip architect"" who can ""lead a chip development effort"" and ""work with other engineers to take chip to product shipment"". Google was particularly looking for expertise in ""image processing, video processing, stabilization."" The Pixel still uses NVIDIA chips, but Google does have internally developed self-driving technology and the greatest number of self-driving miles on record to train its self-driving system.Wrapping UpThe self-driving/autonomous car conversation is just getting started. There will no doubt be much innovation in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insights estimates that financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will surely follow. This is one of the best places to be in because the technology is just being built, so it could be good business. Also, early investors can sell out their interest at a nice premium.For chipmakers it's a rush to grab a share of the pie.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Why the Market Likes Tesla's Capital Raise;3/16/2017;"While most companies tend to see shares fall after announcing   secondary offerings, it's not uncommon forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) shares to rise after announcing fresh capital   raises. This was true for both Tesla's2015 secondary offeringand to lesser extent the 2016 offering. It's also happening today   after the electric-car maker announced last night that it is   having concurrent offerings for both common stock and convertible   notes. Shares are up about 3% as of this writing.This time around, there's probably a more specific reason why   the market is reacting favorably to the offerings: The dilution   hit that existing shareholders are taking ismuchsmaller due to the mix.The proceeds will be used to reduce Model 3 launch risk.     Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The equity sideFor context, consider the past two secondary offerings, which   consisted entirely of stock. Last year's offering, which raised   $1.7 billion, was particularly dilutive.YearShares Outstanding BeforeShares Outstanding AfterDilution2016133.9 million147.3 million10%2015127.1 million130.2 million2%Data source: Offering prospectuses.The $250 million stock offering announced last night is fairly   conservative in terms of dilution. Shareholders took a pretty   large dilution hit last year with the all-stock acquisition of   SolarCity, as there are now 161.6 million shares outstanding.   Tesla is selling between roughly 969,000 and 1.1 million shares,   representing dilution of just 0.6% to 0.7%, depending on if   underwriters exercise their options in full. Underwriters   exercised their options in full for the past two offerings, so it   seems conceivable they will do so again, depending on investor   demand.The debt sideThe bulk of the capital being raised will be coming from $750   million in convertible senior notes due 2022. Here's how the   company closed out 2016 in terms of outstanding principal amounts   for any remaining convertibles.DuePrincipal Amount2018 notes$205 million2019 notes$920 million2021 notes$1.4 billionTotal$2.5 billionData source: 10-K.This does not include the $909 million worth of convertible   notes that Tesla inherited from SolarCity, which bear higher   interest rates (other than a zero-coupon tranche).This comes after Tesla received notices of $422 million worth   of conversions for its 2018 convertibles last summer, which the   company had to repay in cash at the time. In a way, you can think   of it like Tesla is in part refinancing the convertibles that   were redeemed last summer, except the new notes will likely end   up having higher conversion prices.The new batch of convertibles has not priced quite yet, but   Tesla does intend to enter into convertible note hedge   transactions and warrant transactions as a way to mitigate any   possible dilution. The company has done this every time it has   issued convertibles in the past (not including the inherited   SolarCity convertibles).On top of all this, debt capital is generally less expensive   than equity capital, so the cost of capital associated with these   offerings is lower than if it consisted of all stock. Combined   with the minimal dilution that shareholders are facing and the   reduced balance-sheet risk, the market seems to like it.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken a bit of a breather this month after a terrific run. Apple stock gained 30% just between November and early March, and is up over 50% from late June levels.makeArticleAd();The latter run, incredibly, has added about $250 billion to the market value of AAPL stock.Part of the gains have come from the fact that AAPL was just too cheap, particularly below $100 this summer. But optimism toward the iPhone 8 has boosted hopes that Apple stock can jump-start growth. (The issues at key competitorSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), including theGalaxy Note 7 debacle, likely have helped as well.)So the question now for AAPL is when the iPhone 8 is coming - and how much upside might be left from a successful launch and product cycle.For now, it looks like there's still some gains left for Apple stock … but investors might need to have some patience.Will the iPhone 8 Move Apple Stock?At the moment, it appears the iPhone 8 will be launched this fall, according to various reports. But Apple has said little about the launch, leaving a guessing game for observers and investors. Even the name isn't clear: The next phone seems likely to be called the iPhone 8, not the 7S, but that's not assured at the moment.Most observers are expecting an iPhone 8, rather than a 7S, because the next-gen product will have major changes. The most notable was thought to be a curved OLED screen, but those reports have been questioned of late. Iris recognition, facial scanning, and a larger screen (on a phone of similar dimensions) are all expected to be features of various versions of the phone.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsWhat might be most interesting for Apple stock is the price. On Monday morning, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said supplier prices supported a possible $1,000 price for the new iPhone. Other reports of a high-end""Edition""have speculated an ASP over $1,200. Higher prices for iPhones mean higher margins for Apple - and likely a higher multiple for AAPL stock.Will Investors Buy the Leaks and Sell the News?The biggest worry ahead of the launch is if there will be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" reaction from investors.It is clear that some of the optimism over the past few months, in particular, has been driven by consumer reaction to the leaked specs for the new iPhone. Indeed, Apple stock traditionally has been movedalmost solely by iPhone sentiment. Sales of other products have been pretty much flat the last four years.So if there is a large base of investors bidding up the Apple stock price ahead of the iPhone 8, the question then becomes: What might happen in September when the product actually is released?The higher expectations get now, the greater the chance of a disappointment later. Every aspect of the new product will be dissected - and any rumored specs (like, say, the $1,000 price tag) that aren't in the iPhone 8 will be considered a ""miss"" by Apple.What's Left for the iPhone 8?With Apple stock back near an all-time high, that possibility would concern me over the next few months. For investors with a longer-term focus, however, there's still reason to see upside in AAPL off the iPhone 8 launch.Again, AAPL stock generally has matched up well with iPhone product cycles, and that should keep the stock moving upward if the launch and subsequent sales are a success.The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Has Big ImplicationsMeanwhile, a big hit with the new iPhone could once again separate Apple from Samsung. It would also differentiate iOs fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android ecosystem more broadly. That in turn might allow AAPL stock to once again receive a growth multiple, instead of the low-double-digit-plus cash earnings multiple at which it currently trades.In either direction, the iPhone 8 will matter, because the iPhone still is the major profit engine for Apple. Roughly 63% of fiscal 2016 sales came from the iPhone - and given margins, possibly a higher portion of profits. Apple needs a winner in the iPhone 8 to drive Apple stock higher. And while early speculation looks like the iPhone 8 will be a hit, the recent run in AAPL stock may have priced in at least some of that success.Investors hoping for more likely will need to wait for September - and hope Apple has once again delivered on its promise.The author has no position in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlaceHow GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Make a ComebackDoes the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacle Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Interest Rates are Rising -- Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why is Tesla Raising a Billion Dollars in Fresh Capital?;3/16/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAannounced plans to raise around $1.1 billion through a combination of share and senior notes offering, just before initiating the pre-production of its Model 3 sedan. The company will utilize the funds to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce risks associated with the rapid expansion of business. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.makeArticleAd();The electric automaker will be offering shares worth roughly $250 million and convertible senior notes valued $750 million. The notes are due to mature in 2022. Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, intends to purchase 96,900 shares worth $25 million himself.Tesla unveiled the Model 3 sedan in Mar 2016. The vehicle will be the company's first affordable electric car for the mass market, costing almost half as much as Model S. Notably, Model 3 is a four-door, five-seat electric sedan with a range of 215 miles per charge and acceleration of 0-60 mph in less than 6 seconds. Vehicle production and deliveries are expected in the second half of 2017. The company aims to steadily increase production to exceed 5,000 units per week in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10,000 vehicles per week in 2018.Prior to this offering, Tesla had raised $1.7 billion via a public offering of shares in May 2016. The capital was used to finance the accelerated production plan for Model 3 as well as to ramp up annual production volume to 500,000 units by 2018 and 1 million units by 2020.Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $3.39 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. However, the cash balance mostly represents cash generated from its May offering, the SolarCity acquisition and drawings on its credit facilities. Meanwhile, the company saw cash outflow in 2016. The company projected capital expenditures of around $2-$2.5 billion for the first half of 2017, implying limited cash balance before the Model 3 production scheduled for the second half of the year. The company's need for capital had been anticipated last year and increased significantly post the guidance.Tesla Inc. PriceTesla Inc. Price|Tesla Inc.

Tesla, Inc. Makes Up Its Mind: Time to Raise Capital;3/16/2017;"There had been quite a bit of uncertainty in recent quarters   over whether or notTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was going to raise more capital ahead of the Model   3 launch. The company raised $1.7 billion in its May 2016   secondary offering after underwritersexercised all of their options. That put Tesla in a relatively more comfortable financial   position at the time.The following month, it announced its ambitious and   controversial proposal to acquire sister company SolarCity in an   all-stock deal, which many expected to be cash flow negative.   This raised the notion that Tesla may need to raise capital yet   again. Tesla was able to mostly address this concern by   aggressivelyshifting away from solar leases and toward   sales, which pulls forward both revenue recognition and cash flow;   Tesla's solar operations generated $77 million of positive cash   flow last quarter.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Still, it wasn't clear until yesterday what the company was   planning to do. Then Tesla announced concurrent stock and   convertible note offerings, expecting to raise $1.15 billion.Mixed messagesIn theS-4related to the SolarCity acquisition, filed in August, Tesla said   that it was planning to raise more capital (emphasis added):While Tesla expects that its current sources of liquidity,     including cash and cash equivalents, together with its current     projections of cash flow from operating and retail financing     activities, will provide it with adequate liquidity based on     its current plans through at least the end of the current     fiscal year,Tesla is currently planning to raise additional funds     by the end of this year, including through potential equity or debt offerings, subject     to market conditions and recognizing that Tesla cannot be     certain that additional funds would be available to it on     favorable terms or at all.In October, CEO Elon Musk backtracked on that expectation with   aseries of tweets.Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity   will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary   for either.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 9, 2016@roger_kapplerProbably not then either- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 9, 2016On the third-quarter earnings call later that month, Musk   said, ""It seems like we probably won't want to do a capital raise   even in Q1. I'm not saying we won't, but probably not."" Musk   hedged quite a bit, advising to ""take this with a grain of salt""   and noting ""that's not a promise"" -- the statements just   represented Tesla's view at the time. He added that it might make   sense to ""have a larger buffer and to de-risk the business.""On the fourth-quarter earnings call just last month, Musk had   clearly warmed up to the idea:So this is really a question of what is the risk tolerance     of the company. Or how close to the edge do we want to go?     According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised     for the Model 3. But we get very close to the edge. So then     that is probably not the best thing for shareholders on a     risk-adjusted basis. So we are considering a number of options,     but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce     risk.In other words, Tesla is saying it doesn't necessarilyneedthe capital, but it would be helpful just in case.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, as Wall Street continues to cheer what some are calling a ""dovish"" interest rate hike from Federal Reserve. The Fed raised its key fed funds rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%, as expected, but said that it would hike rates only twice more this year, versus expectations for a much more hawkish tone.makeArticleAd();On the economic data calendar, weekly jobless claims are due out ahead of the open, while reports on housing starts, building permits and the Philly Fed index are due later this morning.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.3%, withS&P 500futures gaining 0.19% andNasdaq-100futures jumping 0.21%.On the options front, volume rebounded back above average on Wednesday as options traders engaged in a bit of positioning ahead of the Fed rate hike. Overall, roughly 17.7 million calls and 13.5 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunged to 0.61 from Tuesday's perch at 0.73, though the 10-day moving average edged higher to 0.64.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw increased call volume after RBC Capital boosted its price target on AAPL stock.Oracle Corporation(NASDAQ:ORCL) posted better-than-expected earnings and bumped its dividend, andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it was raising $1.15 billion via stock and debt offerings to fund its Model 3 rollout.Apple Inc. (AAPL)More bullish news on AAPL stock hit yesterday, afterRBC Capital reiterated the sharesat ""outperform"" and lifted its price target to $155 from $140. RBC told clients that it believes Apple's services unit could provide a considerable tailwind for annual revenue. The news helped bump AAPL stock north of resistance at $140, and could bring in technical buyers over the short-term.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashAAPL stock options traders were jazzed about the development. Total volume spiked to more than 921,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an above average 64% of the day's take. Looking out to the April series, we find that AAPL stock is now trading north of both peak call and put open interest at the $140 strike, totaling 84,500 contracts and 50,000 contracts, respectively.If stock can pull away from $140 over the next week, it could be major boon for AAPL bulls. Otherwise, look for Apple shares to get pinned near $140.Oracle Corporation (ORCL)ORCL stock is in rally mode this morning, gaining more than 6.6% in premarket activity. Traders are reacting bullishly tobetter-than-expected earningsafter the close last night, where Oracle said it earned 69 cents per share on revenue of $9.3 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 62 cents a share on sales of $9.3 billion. Cloud sales came in at $1.2 billion. Oracle also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 19 cents per share, a 27% increase its prior dividend of 15 cents per share.ORCL stock options traders were uncertain ahead of the event. Total volume came in at over 324,000 contracts, with calls only managing 53% of the day's take. If ORCL's gains carry over into the open, the shares would vault well north of peak April call OI, totaling 10,000 contracts at the $44 strike.What's more, the 9,300 calls open at the $45 strike could also fall by the wayside, leaving little in the way of potential options related resistance to hold ORCL stock in check.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla was back in the headlines for a second day in a row. On Tuesday, rumors hit thatTesla was building a small SUVdubbed the Model Y, and today TSLA stock is gaining premarket after the company announced it wasraising $1.15 billionto fund its Model 3 rollout.

The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Has Big Implications;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly revving up production of its Model Y crossover, which is slated to come out in 2018. And investors, who were pressing for some good news, wasted no time Tuesday calling shotgun on TSLA stock.makeArticleAd();Shares of the California-based electric vehicle company rose almost $12 Tuesday, rising almost 5% after a report from British automotive magazineAutocarclaimed Tesla is set to unveil a ""Small SUV coming next year."" Production of theModel Y, which is likely to have the same top-hinged doors as the full-size Model X, could start as soon as this year, but would debut no sooner than 2018.Model Y Hype … or Hope?The Model Y would be a critical launch for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who aims to compete withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) in vehicle mass-market production. And it would certainly give a boost to TSLA stock.To that end, while it's only speculation at this point, it makes sense that the Model Y is rumored to be based on the same platform as the Model 3 - Tesla's new and most-affordable model.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonReports suggest the Model Y is ""expected to be slightly more expensive"" than the Model 3, which is said to be priced around $35,000. But if ""more expensive"" still keeps the Model Y at under $45,000, it's still a win - and a breakthrough for Tesla given the popularity of crossovers throughout the United States.While Musk's critics, who have been skeptical of the company's financial position and its rate of cash burn, will claim that Tesla can't net a profit at those prices, the question is: Can Tesla make up the difference on volume?That question can be answered with Tesla's Gigafactory, which provides tons of reasons for optimism about TSLA stock.Once completed, the Gigafactory, which is projected to have capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries for 500,000 vehicles annually, will accelerate the pace at which Tesla can become profitable. This is because the Gigafactory can boost margins on unit sales of the Model S and Model X.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Changed the GameMusk has promised that the Gigafactory, which is a third completed, would be finished by 2018 - in time to start production on the Model Y. And the Gigafactory would still have tons of room to produce ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck"" as Musk hinted upon in his updated""Master Plan""published on Tesla's own website this past summer.Bottom Line for TSLA StockMakingan investment casefor Teslais not that hard. One only need to take a look into the future and realize Elon Musk is already there waiting not only with autonomous vehicles and connected cars, but also with cleaner/renewable energy, space travel and the Hyperloop.With TSLA stock closing Wednesday at $255 - down 10% from its 52-week high of $287.39 reached on Feb. 14 - but heading higher in Thursday's premarket trade, there's a little room for investors who have waited for a buying opportunity, but not much.

Goldman Sachs Redeems Itself Somewhat With Tesla Objectivity;3/16/2017;"It looked really bad.Last year,Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS)upgradedshares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to a buy rating, merehoursbefore the electric-car maker announced its 2016 secondary   offering in May. Goldman was one of the lead book runners in the   deal, and exercised all of its underwriter options tomax out the secondary offering.The timing looked awfully suspicious on Goldman's part.   Goldman's upgrade pushed shares higher, benefiting the offering's   pricing and translating into Goldman collecting more; the   underwriting discount was $1.78 per share and all underwriters in   that deal collectively earned about $19 million thanks to the   full exercise of underwriter options, according to the   prospectus.makeArticleAd();At the time, Goldman toldMarketWatch, ""Our research is independent. We followed all of our standard   policies and procedures with respect to our research publication   on Wednesday."" The timing of the two announcements was ultimately   probably a coincidence, but the optics could not have been   worse.Tesla announced last night that would be doing a common stock   offering ($250 million) as well a convertible note offering ($750   million). Guess who's among the lead book runners.Image source: Tesla.Spoiler alertAmong a few other big banks, Goldman will be acting as lead   joint book-running manager for the offering. This time around,   the news comes after Goldman issued a downgrade on Tesla shares   inlate February, from hold to sell. The main concerns driving Goldman's rating   change were risks associated with the Model 3 launch, the recent   acquisition of SolarCity, and ongoing free cash flow burn.It's worth noting that we're talking about two different   analysts. Goldman analyst Patrick Archambault, who issued the May   2016 buy rating, left the investment bank last year and passed   the metaphorical baton to analyst David Tamberrino, who   downgraded shares to neutral in October. Tamberrino then took an   even more bearish stance with the downgrade just last month.Chinese wall intact?Goldman issuing a downgrade a few weeks ahead of the offerings   does look a bit better in terms of its objectivity. Investment   banks are required to maintain a ""Chinese wall"" between their   research divisions and investment banking divisions in order to   mitigate any conflicts of interest.How intact these Chinese walls really are remains an open   debate, but at least in this case Goldman can more justifiably   argue that its research is indeed independent. Incidentally,   shares are higher now than they were after the downgrade was   issued.Reducing balance sheet riskAs far as Tesla is concerned, it's taking a slightly more   conservative approach with this offering. It's smaller, with the   aggregate gross proceeds expected at $1.15 billion. The proceeds   will be used to invest in capital expenditures ahead of Model 3   production, which Tesla recently guided to $2 billion to $2.5   billion.On the last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that a   capital raise may make sense in order to reduce balance sheet   risk. However, Tesla gave mixed messages in late 2016 regarding   the prospect of a capital raise, so it wasn't clear if Tesla was   actually going to pull the trigger this time. It did.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Halliburton Company (HAL) Stock Is Rally-Ready!;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors witnessed a broad-based rally on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates and signaling further hikes to come later this year. However, the rally wasn't just confined to regular ol' U.S. blue chips - it also spilled over into bonds, commodities, high yield and emerging markets. What particularly caught my attention was the rally in crude oil, which resulted in oil-related stocks such asHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) bouncing meaningfully off of critical technical support.makeArticleAd();Traders and investors now have very well-defined risk to play HAL stock to the upside.Before digging into the charts of Halliburton shares, allow me to remind you that a plethora of arguments can be made about the validity and sustainability of any stock market rally. However, as active investors we must primarily be realists in the sense that until a trend changes or at least gives off strong signals that it may soon do so, it is by definition to early to start leaning the other way in any meaningful way.Wednesday's broad market rally was just another reminder of this. Stocks - which some bears have been calling ""overvalued"" for weeks and months - simply continued to rip  higher. It is neither our job to fight market trends nor to prove that we are smarter than the average investor.Our only task as market participants is to make money. Period.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashWednesday's rally in the price of oil, which bounced off its 200-day simple moving average, lifted the entire oil services industry stocks, as represented by TheMarket Vectors Oil Services ETF(NYSEARCA:OIH). As a result, many of the charts in the space - including HAL stock - look very similar in their bullish trading setups.HAL Stock ChartsStarting off with the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after breaking past the black horizontal line last November, Halliburton stock continued to rally right to the upper end of the up-trending channel.Click to EnlargeThe retracement since those January 2017 highs pulled the stock back to a key technical confluence zone made up of the following:The black horizontal line (former resistance, now support?)The lower end of the up-trending channel (purple-dotted parallel lines)The 50- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow and red lines, respectively).This is one serious area of confluence support around the $47.50 - $48.50 area.A bounce from here if not an outright new leg higher stands a good chance. More importantly so, this support area will act as a last resort stop-loss area for long side positions being initiated here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Rumors Changed the GameOn the daily chart, we see that on Tuesday, March 14, HAL stock bounced off its 200-day moving average (red) as downside momentum - as represented by the MACD oscillator - reached oversold extremes.Click to EnlargeWednesday's post-Fed rally served as what I refer to as ""follow-through buying."" and thus it was no great surprise that my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator flashed a clear buy signal.Barring any nasty bearish reversals in coming days, HAL stock now looks poised to rally into the mid-$50s as a next upside target.Like what you see?

The day is known for a lot of things, but many use it as an excuse to drink a lot, which isn't far off from the reality of it.However, the day truly revolves around the celebration of St. Patrick, who was a missionary and bishop in Ireland in the fifth century. He was made a slave by Irish pirates, who took him to Ireland and made him into a slave before he escaped.Later in life, he returned to Ireland as a bishop and eventually became known as the patron saint of the land.

Investing in EV Infrastructure: Where the Money Is Going;3/15/2017;"Last year, 159,139 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S.,   according toInside EVs, but that's just scratching the surface of the industry's   potential.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) plans to build 500,000 EVs in 2018 andGeneralMotors(NYSE: GM) just launched its first big bet on EVs in the Chevy   Bolt, which will test the size of the market. With new cars fromNissan, Porsche,VW, Volvo, and many others, there looks to be an EV boom on the   horizon. But the size of that boom is currently unknown.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (which typically   underestimates new technologies) predicts that annual EV and   plug-in EV sales will be 1.3 million by 2025 and that 7.5 million   EVs will be on the road by then. Meanwhile, GTM Research   estimates that a total of 11.4 million EVs will be on the road in   the U.S. by 2025 and Bloomberg New Energy Finance thinks 35%   of all new vehicles sold in 2040 will be electric.We know that the EV market will be big and that, given the   scale of the numbers above and the speed of growth, EV charging   infrastructure will become increasingly important across the   country. That presents an opportunity for the companies building   out these charging capabilities.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The chargers themselves could be big businessAs EVs become more common, someone has to provide millions of   chargers for personal and public use.Aerovironment(NASDAQ: AVAV) has taken a leading position in the charger market   with partnerships with Volvo, Nissan,Ford, and others. The company has also releasedcharging plansand session prices for Level 2 (12-26 miles of charge per hour)   and fast charging (40 miles of charge in 10 minutes) on the West   Coast, where it is building out a network. In its most   recent quarter, electric charging product sales jumped 74% to   $11.3 million, a small but growing base for a small company to   build on.General Electric(NYSE: GE) is also moving into the market, selling home chargers   and public charging options. As it's a major electricity   component supplier, this is an adjacent market it can enter with   little risk, and I would expect to see GE's charger revenue   grow as the market grows.Of course, there's Tesla's charging infrastructure as well.   Tesla sells most of its own charging components to customers, and   as it's the biggest EV company, it's a big business. But the   proprietary charging technology it has bet on may end up   eventually walling it off from competitors.How chargers get builtWhat's less known is who will build the charger infrastructure   and how it will be paid for. Tesla's Supercharger network has   been built out entirely by Tesla for the use of its own   customers. It's been free for years, but now new Model S and   Model X customers will get 400 kWh of supercharging free and then   pay a fee for charging based on local electricity costs.   Competing auto manufacturers haven't shown much interest in   building out their own networks and will most likely let someone   else build chargers.Image source: Getty Images.Utilities have shown some interest in chargers being a growth   opportunity. In California,San Diego Gas & Electricis building 3,500 utility-owned chargers for $45 million,Southern California Edisonis building 1,500 host-owned chargers for $22 million, andPacific Gas & Electricis building the infrastructure behind 7,500 chargers in a   utility-private investor partnership. The question here is   whether or not utilities should be able to build chargers under   their monopoly power and therefore rate-base the cost to all   consumers, whether they own an electric vehicle or not. In   theory, a utility's low cost of capital could help build out   charger networks more quickly, although keeping utilities out of   the market may bring in more innovative business models from   private companies.The third option is third-party charging networks.NRG Energy(NYSE: NRG)  tried to get into this business but sold off   EVgo earlier this year to an investment firm that may be able to   grow the network more effectively. The national network now   countsBMW, Ford, and Nissan as partners, and its early mover status may be   helpful long term. ChargePoint is the nation's largest charging   network, aggregating local EV charging stations into a national   network. Blink is another company building a large network, which   is currently about 4,000 stations.EV charging will be big but still faces risksWhat's unique here is that there are three distinct business   models colliding in EV charging, and we don't know which one will   win long term. My money would be on third-party networks   eventually becoming victorious because of their national scope   and ability to provide different charging technologies. And if   they do, these (mostly private) networks and the companies that   build the chargers will be the big winners for investors.What we do know is that with millions of EVs expected to hit   the road in the next decade, this is a big opportunity for   companies that can get their business model right.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Create Income From Value;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few weeks ago, I shared a trade idea inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) from which I was lucky enough to scalp profits. Although I believe in the longer-term story, we could see temporary resistance in MSFT stock - at least in the short-term.makeArticleAd();I'm still steadfast in the thesis that, given the current macroeconomic environment, stocks will at worst meander for months. Thus, I have a trade setup that will let time make us money.Click to EnlargeMicrosoft's fundamental prospects remain solid. So, in the absence of a new bearish headline, MSFT stock should trade right along with the general equity markets. The short-term macroeconomic picture is riddled with nagging issues that could cause dips, but bulls have been buying them back up.Because of Microsoft's solid fundamentals, I want to put more time on the clock so I don't have to worry about short-term price gyrations.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomThis is not the kind of trade idea you can use in unproven stocks likeSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), by the way.How to Trade MSFT Stock HereThe bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $50 put for $1.50 per contract. This is a bullish trade that assumes Microsoft stock will stay above my sold strike through next January.By selling the put, I have committed to buying the shares at $50 if MSFT stock falls below that threshold. The current price buffer gives this trade - in which I'm betting that support levels established in 2014 will hold - a 90% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is not suited for all investors, however. That's OK. I can modify the trade into a credit spread. This would make it more appealing to less aggressive traders or smaller accounts.Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc's (SNAP) ThunderThe alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $52.50/$50 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade, but one that has a finite risk profile. For that, I sacrifice some buffer and potential profits since with limited risk comes limited profit potential. If successful, though, this trade on MSFT stock will still yield 15% on risk.Selling options can be dangerous, so never risk more than you are willing to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Go Long Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock While Everyone’s Wrong;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) stock enjoyed a 150% rally in the past 12 months. But that's only about halfway back from the 2014 all time highs. Nevertheless, MU stock still has room to go from a technical perspective.makeArticleAd();Micron fundamentals are in good shape as we are now more dependent on technology than ever. The trend suggests that the ramp will get even steeper so we are not slowing down. Micron will benefit from the digitization of the globe.Technically speaking, MU stock is at a long-term pivot level where resistance can build. So jumping all in at this point without a safety net can be risky, especially when equity markets are at all-time highs.Click to EnlargeMore often than not, it's difficult to find great entry points in stocks that are on fire. Today, though, we're getting a dip, which helps. Plus, using MU options gives us a lot more flexibility. There, we can find value areas that I believe are safe, and we can sell risk against them.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Furthermore, the current open interest suggests potential downside pressure.How to Trade MU Stock HereThe trade:Sell the MU Oct $18 put naked and collect 80 cents per contract. By doing this, we are committing to owning Micron stock at $18 per share if the price falls below it. Our breakeven price in this case would be $17.20. Since we are using longer-dated contracts, I am confident that we can manage risk around the short-term price gyrations. I don't want to hedge my bet.That said, selling naked risk isn't for everyone, so to moderate the trade, we can turn it into a credit put spread instead.The milder alternate:Sell the MU Oct $19/$17 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade which will potentially yield 20% on risk.Both trades have a roughly 85% theoretical chance of success. The spread advantage is that it carries finite risk, but at the cost of lower absolute reward.Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc's (SNAP) ThunderSo instead of chasing price targets in MU stock, either of these setups will yield profits as long as MU stock stays above the risk. From current prices, we're leaving more than 25% room for error.Even though we're committing to longer-dated contracts, we can close our options trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL);3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are indicating a bit of a rebound from yesterday's losses, which is a bit surprising given the dearth of data set to wash over Wall Street in the next two days. While a rate hike from the Federal Reserve is already priced in, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen could still offer up a few surprises in her commentary on the Fed's rate path and the strength of the U.S. economy.makeArticleAd();What's more, there is a veritable flood of economic data on tap today, with the consumer price index, retail sales, the Empire State index as well as home builders and business inventories.In spite of this deluge of data, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere last seen higher by 0.17%, withS&P 500futures up 0.25% andNasdaq-100futures adding 0.21%.On the options front, Tuesday was another relatively low-volume session, as only about 12.5 million calls and 12.3 million puts changed hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio extended Monday's advance to arrive at 0.73, while the 10-day moving average settled in at 0.63.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) drew mixed options activity after VRX stock plunged on news that hedge fund manager and activist investor Bill Ackman has exited his holdings in the company. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) saw renewed call options interest on Model Y rumors and a target hike from Deutsche Bank. Finally,Delta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) fell amid blizzard flight cancellations, but saw several large call bets looking for a rebound.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX)VRX stock plunged more than 10% on Tuesday following news that activist investor Bill Ackman's hedge fundcompletely closed out of its position in Valeant.7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe timing of the news was particularly notable, coming just after the company initiated several new initiatives, including asset sales to help pay down debt. VRX shares are now trading just north of single-digit territory, an area the stock last flirted with in 2009.Option volume on VRX ramped up to more than 535,000 contracts following the news, with calls and puts nearly split on the day. This divided sentiment among VRX options traders extends over the short- to intermediate-term, as the April put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 1.06, with calls and puts in near parity. Currently, peak April call OI totals about 20,000 contracts at the overhead $20 strike, while peak put OI of 36,000 contracts rests at the in-the-money $12.50 strike.Tesla Inc (TSLA)While most of the report hinged on already-known data, a speculative report from a British car publication ignited rumors that Tesla could be set tolaunch a new compact SUV dubbed the Model Y. According to the report, the Model Y is based on the Model 3's platform and will be slightly more expensive than the Model 3. The report also concluded that, with the rising popularity of small SUVs in the U.S., ""the compact Model Y could turn out to be Tesla's best seller.""Meanwhile, TSLA stock received another boost afterDeutsche Bank lifted its price targeton the shares from $215 to $220. Driving the upgrade, Deutsche Bank said it believes Tesla could hit breakeven by the fourth quarter of this year and move into profitability in 2018 as the Model 3 ramps up volume. That said, the upgrade still represents a discount to TSLA's close north of $258 yesterday.While the pair of reports was enough to move TSLA stock nearly 5% higher, options traders were not as impressed. Sure, total volume rose to a near-term high of 345,000 contracts, but calls only managed to eke out 56% of the day's take. Looking out to the April series, TSLA options traders are just as stoic, with the put/call OI ratio ballooning to 1.31, with puts easily outnumbering calls on the month.TSLA options bulls have their sights set on the $270 strike, where more than 3,500 contracts currently reside, while the bears have targeted the $210 strike with 3,300 contracts.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Blizzard-like conditions snarled air travel in the Northeast yesterday, forcing thecancellation of more than 5,000 flightsin New York, Boston and Washington D.C. In typical fashion, airline stocks were hit hard on the news, with the NYSE ARCA Airline Index dropping more than 2%. Delta shares were also punished, underperforming their peers with a 2.26% loss of altitude on the day.But options traders weren't having it. DAL saw volume soar to a near-term high of more than 254,000 contracts, with calls snapping up roughly 90% of the day's take - an outsized ratio that is more typically seen ahead of ex-dividend dates. But DAL's ex-div date passed late last month, meaning that options traders were buying up calls in earnest for another reason entirely.Can Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI) Reinvent Itself?Diving into data fromTrade-Alert.com, we find that several large block trades crossed at DAL's June $50 and $55 call strikes. While all of the trades crossed at separate times throughout the day, they all had the same basic design as the largest such trade, which involved 20,000 purchased June $50 calls and 20,000 sold June $55 puts - a bull call spread with an ask price of 94 cents, or $94 per contract, a break even of $50.94 and a maximum profit of $4.06, or $406 per pair of contracts.That's quite a return, if DAL can return to higher ground amid the summer travel season.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc’s (SNAP) Thunder;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe cat is out of the bag.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is copyingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), and it is doing it everywhere.makeArticleAd();First, it was Instagram Stories. Then it was WhatsApp Status. Now it's Messenger Day. With each copycat iteration, the chorus of bearish arguments against FB stock gets louder and louder. They are all pretty similar, and they go something like: ""Facebook is playing catch-up"" or ""Facebook isn't innovating"" or ""Snap will steal Facebook's users.""The market doesn't seem to be giving those arguments much credence. Facebook stock is up 13% since Instagram Stories launched and is currently at all-time highs. SNAP stock, meanwhile, is 25% off its post-IPO high and continues to make new lows.I think the market has it right on this one. Here's why.Facebook Stole Snap's ThunderOne thingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) taught the technology world is that you don't need to be first to market to succeed. The iPhone was far from the first smartphone to market. Apple let other companies introduce the concept and dabble in prototypes, then Apple leaped on the opportunity when the time was right.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomIn other words, you don't have to be first. You just have to be better and have the right timing.Facebook is bigger, and in the social media world, that is better. The timing is also right for Facebook to be playing copycat.Scale is what has driven profits and driven FB stock higher. The entire Facebook ecosystem has tremendous scale. The main Facebook app has scale. Messenger has scale. Instagram has scale. WhatsApp has scale. This pervasive scale offers two advantages:Firstly, scale will convert Snap Story users into Facebook users. As thisMashablewriterpoints out, there is a certain broadcasting element to Snap and Instagram Stories. When you blast a picture or video out on social media for 24 hours, you do so with the intent of grabbing as many eyeballs as possible. Snap only has so many eyeballs. Instagram has more than two times as many eyeballs. Messenger has more than six times, and WhatsApp more than seven times.Secondly, scale will allow FB to grab users before they ever even migrate to Snap. Instagram Stories just rolled out internationally, where Snap only has some 90 million daily active users. Messenger and WhatsApp also have large international reach. As Instagram Stories, WhatsApp Status, and Messenger Day launch globally, it will be the first time many of their users have seen the ""Stories"" concept. To them, there is no copying or mimicking at work. Just a cool new feature on a favorite platform.The timing of Facebook's ""imitation game"" has also been pretty close to perfect.The concept of ephemeral media messaging, particularly the core concept of Stories, really took off in 2016. Snap saw its daily active user base grow from 107 million at the end of 2015 to 143 million by the middle of 2016.But then Instagram Stories launched in August 2016, and Snap's user growth slowed. Snap ended the year with only 158 million daily actives. That means the platform added 36 million users in the first half of 2016 but only 15 million in the second-half.Meanwhile, in just 25 weeks, Instagram Stories grew to150 million actives(the same size as Snap).What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?It looks like Instagram stole Snap's thunder in August, and rolled with it into the end of the year while Snap more or less flat-lined.Bottom Line on FB StockFacebook is playing copycat, and so far, it's working. Moreover, it likely will continue to work, and FB will only grow its user base and unit revenue as Snap fades into social media memory.All in all, FB stock has become a classic ""buy-the-dip"" situation with a secular growth story and a reasonable - but not great - valuation. At nearly 21 times next year's consensus earnings estimate, Facebook really isn't all the expensive. Earnings are actually expected to grow 28% this year and 23% next year, so the stock trades at a discount to its growth. That is rare for a hyper-growth tech company.Facebook also has more than $10 per share in cash on the balance sheet and generates consistently strong cash flows.For what it's worth, I'm not running to buy FB stock here near all-time highs. But Iamlooking to add to my position on any dips.As of the writing of this article, Luke Lango was long FB.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Changed the Game3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are three announcements we've been waiting forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) to make in the near future:makeArticleAd();A March special event to launch an upgraded 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Air replacement.A third iPad -an all new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with design cues from the iPhone 8- seems ready to go in May or June.The move-in date for its new Apple Park ""spaceship"" campus.A new report suggests the company is juggling the timelines and plans to hold an April Apple Event combining all three.New iPads Are OverdueApple's iPad lineup may not be doing the same business it once was, but it's still due for a refresh.The iPad Pro line aimed at prosumers is priced at a premium, helping to boost revenue for the division, but it competes against some tough adversaries, includingMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro. Apple is expected to release a next generation version of 2015's 12.9-inch iPad Pro to stay current.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomAnall-new iPad Prothat is also expected in the late spring. This one is a 10.5-inch form factor, but it seems likely to borrow from the design of the upcoming iPhone 8, with an edge-to-edge display and virtual Home button. Doing so gives AAPL a physically smaller iPad Pro, with a display larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, making it more useful for professionals.The company is expected to also ship a replacement for the iPad Air 2, its full-sized consumer tablet that was released in 2014.The new iPad Air and 12.9-inch iPad Pro were expected to be unveiled in March, but with the month half-over, an April Apple event seems more likely.Such a move also jives with rumors back in January that AAPL might be experiencing somemanufacturing challenges that could result in a later release.New iPads Identified in the WildOn Monday,9to5 Macbroke the news that an analytics firm hasdetected the identifiers for new iPad models in app downloadsin the Cupertino area.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How “Model Y” Report Changed the Game;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied close to 5% on Tuesday on the back of a report saying the electric vehicle maker is planning on yet another new cardubbed the ""Model Y.""While to my knowledge, Tesla has yet to confirm or deny these rumors, the positive reaction in TSLA stock must be respected.makeArticleAd();From a technical analysis standpoint, Tesla stock bounced off important support that could offer traders and investors a good reference area around which to build their trades.It was only three weeks ago, on Feb. 22, when Tesla reported its latest batch of earnings. In response, investors sold off TSLA stock with both hands.Case in point? When I last mused about shares of Tesla onFeb. 24(the day following the initial reaction to the company's earnings report), I said that while TSLA remains an attractive longer-term growth story, technically speaking, it had reached the upper end of a longer-standing trading range and looked poised for a breather. I also offered that a mean-reversion move lower toward the $240 area looked to be in the cards.Just a few days later (Feb. 27), Tesla stock had reached its 50-day moving average near $242 - close enough to the $240 area, and enough to allow traders to take profits on any short positions.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Before looking closer into the technical meaning of Tuesday's bounce, let's review the bigger picture.TSLA Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear chart, we can see that despite selling pressure following the February earnings report and yesterday's bounce, Tesla shares remain largely in a well-defined yet wide trading range.Click to EnlargeMy contacts on Wall Street capital markets trading desks continue to point toward another possible round of capital raise by Tesla Inc as a next event to look for - then depending on how investors react, potentially scale back into the stock at a better size.As a former investment banker, I agree with my contacts that a capital raise would be a critical time to look at TSLA stock closely. Still, I have to also respect Tuesday's bounce.On the daily chart, we see that Tuesday's rally in TSLA stock took place at a technical juncture that I often refer to as a ""confluence area"" of support.Click to EnlargeNote the simple black diagonal resistance line, which the stock pierced above in January. This line now coincides with the yellow 50-day simple moving average - a moving average that for the past 12 months had been a good reference area for the stock.Through this lens, the pullback in TSLA shares over the past few weeks merely offered a retest of this former diagonal line of technical resistance. Now, following Tuesday's rally, this line may have become technical support.Sell Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Before the Rate Hike!While one day does not make a trend, the $240 area could now be used as a good reference area of support. Options players could consider selling out-of-the-money put spreads, which is a more conservative way to express an intermediate-term quasi-bullish view on the stock.Quicker traders could consider buying TSLA stock for a trade and see if it offers any follow-through buying in coming days toward the $270 area as a next upside target.Either way, the $240 area offers a good reference area for Tesla; if it breaks, then next support likely lies closer to the $220 area.Like what you see?

Tesla's Model 3 Reservation Count Likely Hasn't Changed Much;3/14/2017;"It's now been nearly a year sinceTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) provided its one and only disclosure on how many   Model 3 reservations it has collected. When Tesla conducted its   secondary offering last year, it confirmed that in the month and   a half following the Model 3 unveiling it had garnered 373,000   reservations as of May 15, 2016. Since then, numerous analysts   have asked for updates on this figure, which management has   declined to answer for fear that any updates would be needlessly   overscrutinized.There are only clues, but it looks like Tesla's total Model 3   reservation tally hasn't changed much over the past year.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Normal fluctuationsThe balance sheet line item to look at is customer deposits.   This figure naturally fluctuates as customers place deposits for   new vehicles, which are subsequently released when the vehicle is   delivered. Throughout 2014 and 2015, these fluctuations were   often in the $20 million to $30 million range.At $1,000 per reservation, the aforementioned 373,000 figure   from last year represents $373 million worth of deposits. Due to   the timing of the unveiling last year, which occurred on the very   last day of Q1 2016, not all deposits taken on March 31 were   captured in the corresponding balance sheet data due to credit   card and bank processing times. In other words, that $373 million   increase in deposits took place over two quarters in terms of   balance sheet dates.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.The difference between deposits on Dec. 31, 2015, and June 30,   2016, was $396.5 million, or that same $373 million and then some   within range of standard fluctuations. But since then, customer   deposits have not changed meaningfully beyond what would be   considered standard fluctuations. More specifically, CFO Jason   Wheeler attributed last quarter's sequential decline of $27   million to a large number of Model X Signature Series that were   delivered, which originally had higher deposits.This suggests that Tesla's total Model 3 reservation tally has   not changed much.That's not necessarily a bad thingTo be clear, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Wheeler   notes that Tesla does not ""want to make the line longer at this   point,"" and CEO Elon Musk said the company ""anti-sells"" the Model   3 for this reason. So the company is not actively trying to grow   the Model 3 line, and the first year's worth of production is   already effectively allocated to current reservation holders;   Tesla's site says new reservations won't deliver until ""mid 2018   or later.""The initial spike in reservations was certainly driven by   pent-up demand from enthusiast consumers that have long wanted a   Tesla but have been waiting for a more affordable option. For   consumers that are considering a wider range of brands for their   next vehicle purchase, there's little to no point in placing a   $1,000 deposit for a vehicle that won't be delivered for another   year or longer. It's easier to sit on the sidelines and see how   things play out, and see if Tesla can execute better in areas   like quality control and customer support.A longer line is also meaningless to Tesla if it's already   backlogged by over a year, and its main focus is ramping   production and addressing any early issues that arise (which is   why the first deliveries will go to employees in the Bay Area,   close to the Fremont factory). There would very likely be a   tendency among critics to spin a relatively unchanged reservation   count as a negative storyline, which may be what management is   trying to avoid by not giving updates.What matters most for the time being is just getting the   $35,000 electric vehicle out there.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Popped Today;3/14/2017;"Shares of TeslaTSLAgained more than 4.2% in afternoon trading Tuesday after a speculative report from a British car publication fueled rumors that the electric vehicle manufacturer is set to launch a new compact SUV.This new speculation was caused by a story published byAutocardetailing the Model Y, a rumored compact crossover that is reportedly based on the same platform as Tesla's new affordable Model 3. According to the report, the Model Y is ""expected to be slightly more expensive"" than the Model 3.Citing the popularity of crossovers throughout the U.S, the story claims that ""the compact Model Y could turn out to be Tesla's best seller."" The website even generated their own mockup of what the new car would look like, and its sleek design cannot be overstated.The only problem is that the report seems to be based on absolutely no new information. In his updated ""Master Plan"" published on Tesla's ownwebsitethis past summer, Elon Musk detailed his goal to ""address most of the consumer market"" with the Model 3, as well as ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck.""So we've already known that a compact SUV is in Tesla's future. Throw in an obvious observation that the new car will probably cost more than the Model 3, speculate that it will be a bestseller based on the popularity of similar vehicles, and boom-you've got yourself a story that looks powerful enough to move this stock.In reality, if the Model Y starts production in late 2018 as Autocar suggests, it will be behind several other comparable compact electric SUVs.And that's not even mentioning the fact that Musk's brief mention of a compact SUV was sandwiched in between his plans to shake up the energy storage market and his aspirations to revolutionize trucking and public transportation.In the new Master Plan, Musk said that, outside of consumer vehicles, ""there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.""He also claimed that both are in the early stages of development and should be ready to be unveiled in 2017.So maybe that's what we should be looking forward to next?Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Is This Why Tesla Shares Jumped Today?;3/14/2017;"It's a relatively slow news day forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , yet shares have jumped over $11, or 4.5%, as of   this writing. While theIntelandMobileyedeallikely pushes up comparable valuations for any company involved   in autonomous driving technology -- given the incredible premium   that the chipmaker is paying for a company that was already very   richly valued to begin with -- that deal was announced yesterday,   so is unlikely to be driving today's gains.OopsIt seems more probable that the market is reacting favorably   to a MarketWatch article published earlier in the day that   claimed, ""Small SUV coming next year from Tesla,"" citing a report fromAutocar. Unfortunately, MarketWatch appears to be mistaken.MarketWatch, which has a much larger following than the   smaller British automotive magazine, states: ""The Model Y would   be unveiled 'sometime next year,' the magazine said, with   production slated for later in the year. It is likely to have the   same top-hinged doors as the full-size Model X, it said."" But   Autocar never actually claims this, nor does it cite any sources   that might be privy to the Model Y's unveiling.makeArticleAd();Tesla's current SUV, the Model X. Image source: Tesla.Instead, Autocar merely says, ""The Model Y is unlikely to be   unveiled until some time next year, with production set to follow   late in the year."" Saying the vehicle is ""unlikely to be unveiled   until some time next year"" isnotthe same as ""would be unveiled"" next year or that it is ""coming   next year."" There seems to be some inadvertent semantic confusion   on MarketWatch's part, but that's not stopping shares from   jumping on the prospect of Tesla's electric compact SUV; Autocar   is mostly just reiterating all of the prevalent (and already   known) Model Y rumors.Sorry, investors. Nothing to see here.Model Y will be important, but it's probably farther outThat being said, Tesla certainly is working on a compact SUV.   CEO Elon Musk has casually discussed the Model Y on many   occasions over the years, and then formally committed on paper to   ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck"" in hisMaster Plan, Part Deuxblog post last July. The Model Y's potential is arguably even   greater than the Model 3, given the secular shift away from   sedans toward crossovers and compact SUVs that the market has   been experiencing for many years and remains ongoing. That trend   isn't going away anytime soon.Here's a snapshot of last month's auto sales data.Vehicle CategoryFebruary 2017 Unit SalesChange (YOY)Midsize cars229,000(15%)Small cars206,000(10%)Luxury cars67,000(8%)Crossover396,00012%Midsize SUV80,000(4%)Large SUV27,00028%Small SUV19,00011%Luxury SUV18,0001%Data source: Motor Intelligence viaWSJ.Figures rounded.Getting into the mainstream compact SUV market will be an   important milestone eventually, but it's extremely unlikely that   Tesla is anywhere near ready to unveil the Model Y, given how   long automotive design, testing, and validation cycles are and   the simple fact that Model 3 is the top priority right now. For   reference, Model S and Model X launched three years apart. It   would also be unwise to distract potential Model 3 customers that   might rather wait for a Model Y, possibly resulting in lost   sales.Model Y is in the pipeline, but probably not so soon.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

NVIDIA or Intel: Which Is Better for Driverless Car Investors?;3/14/2017;"Self-driving cars, once the stuff of science fiction movies, are set to become a reality soon. Already many driver-assist features, such as lane changing, traffic jam assistant and others, are being offered by automakers. Such features are, essentially, stepping stones to autonomous driving technology.By definition, an autonomous vehicle is a car that is able to take on the primary transportation capabilities of a driver-controlled car. It can sense its surrounding environment and navigate that space without the involvement of humans. Technology like radar, lidar, GPS and computer vision help the cars accomplish this feat.Nearly all automakers are now in various stages of developing self-driving cars. Some have even started testing them on public roads. Although bringing these cars to market will take years, it is obvious that driverless cars have a place in the future of the technology industry. Thus, long-term investors interested in the technology sector would be well-advised to invest in stocks that look set to gain from this trend. Since the market is dominated by a few large players, it makes sense to weigh the pros and cons before investing.Huge Growth Potential of the IndustryAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estimates encourage us about NVIDIA Corp.NVDAand Intel Corp's.INTCgrowth prospects in the space. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the two companies is well poised to capitalize on this opportunity. Both these companies have generated high returns for investors so far and have the potential to exceed expectations in the days ahead.NVIDIA Vs. IntelNVIDIA and Intel are two big players within the driverless car space.Intel recently struck a deal to acquire driver assistance technology company Mobileye N.V.MBLYfor roughly $15.3 billion. The deal marks the next step in the driverless car race.Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a ""leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,"" according to a company statement Monday. ""Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""The deal comes afterMobileye partneredwith self-driving technology company Delphi Automotive in Aug. 2016. The two companies planned to create an affordable self-driving car platform to sell to carmakers by 2019. In Nov. 2016,Intel announcedthat Mobileye and Delphi would use its processors. Intel, Mobileye and German automaker BMW AG partnered to test 40 self-driving cars, which could possibly lead to production by 2021.Intel's purchase helps the technology giant begin to compete in therace towards autonomous car technology.In January, Intel announced it would purchase a 15% stake in digital mapmaker Here International B.V., joining BMW AG and Volkswagen AG'sVLKAYAudi, to further the development in the real-time technology needed to improve self-driving car technology.With these types of partnerships in mind, Intel and Mobileye's biggest competitor going forward will be NVIDIA and its collaboration with Tesla Inc.TSLA. NVIDIA is best known for its gaming and smartphone graphics chips, but like Intel, the company has been developing computing hardware for cars.NVIDIA's foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space has also been driving the stock higher since mid-2015. It should be noted that during the last reported quarter (fourth quarter of fiscal 2017), the company witnessed a 38% year-over-year jump in automotive segment revenues, mainly driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars.Notably, during the 2017 CES event, the company announced two important collaborations - with HERE and ZENRIN - that will expand the Live Map capabilities of autonomous vehicles Apart from this, the company announced an extension of its decade-long partnership with Audi. The two companies have now decided to put advanced AI cars on the road starting 2020.It should be noted that NVIDIA forayed into autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space in 2015 by launching a computer vision system at the CES. It hasn't looked back since then and has been continuously bringing new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of 2016, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 - the world's most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. In Sep 2016, the graphic chip behemoth unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles.Notably, since 2015, NVIDIA has been providing various autonomous technologies such as digital instrument clusters, navigation, advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment under its partnerships with several automakers including HondaHMC, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Therefore, we believe that the recent permit to test its driverless cars will encourage various other auto manufacturers to use NVIDIA's processing units in their autonomous driving systems.For years, these two companies have battled each other for market share and brand recognition in every conceivable way.Which Stock to Choose?Share priceNVIDIA, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained 216.9% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorizedSemiconductor-Generalindustry's return of just about 39.9%.We note that Intel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry in the past one year. While the company's shares gained 10.9%, the industry returned 38.9% in the same period. Moreover, we don't expect the shares to rebound in the near term.Estimate RevisionsOver the past month, NVIDIA's current quarter estimates have risen from 63 cents per share to 67 cents per share and current year estimates have risen from $2.69 per share to $2.79 per share.While Intel's current quarter estimates over the past one month have not shown any movement and is pegged at 65 cents. However, current year estimates have risen from $2.79 per share to $2.89 per share, over the same time frame.Style Score, EPS Growth Rate, Market CapNVIDIA has a Growth Style Score of ""A"" with a long-term expected growth rate of 10.3%. The company has a market cap of $58.38 billion.Intel has a Growth Style Score of ""B"" with a long-term expected growth rate of 8.42%. The company has a market cap of $169.78 billion.ConclusionThese two stocks have grabbed the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and strong growth projections, with their share of pros and cons. But given the current scenario, we would bet on NVIDIA because it is well-positioned to outpace the industry and is fundamentally strong enough to withstand risks. Also, NVIDIA was one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 last year, and there's a very good chance it could perform that way again in 2017.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Most of those answers, however, won't be terribly favorable opinions regarding the deal.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEither the iconic chipmaker overpaid for Mobileye shares, or Intel has no business leaving its comfort zone (CPUs and chipsets), or both. Besides, long-term INTC owners know the company doesn't have the best track record when it comes to making acquisitions.There's a certain ""crazy like a fox"" quality to this purchase, though. Intel stock holders may want to take a step back and look at the same long-term picture CEO Brian Krzanich is seeing.Not OptimisticOn Monday, tech-giant Intel announced it was acquiring Mobileye - the maker of the ""eyes"" used by self-driving and auto-braking automobiles -for $63.54 per share of MBLY, or $15.3 billion in all.That's a 45% premium to Friday's closing trade! But perhaps more concerning is that at $15.3 billion,Intel will be paying 42.7 times last year's salesand 141.7 times 2016's income from Mobileye. Both are on the order of ten times the norm.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Analysts were mixed on the matter, although a few were particularly optimistic. Perhaps the most bullish view came from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann,who explained:""Intel is seeking relevance in automotive with the Mobileye acquisition in a market that is moving at a faster-than-expected pace. The acquisition is in line with the Altera acquisition in that it is defensive in nature and meant to defend Intel's historical CPU (central processing unit) incumbency from various accelerator technologies.""At the more pessimistic end of the scale, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry opined:""Basically, Intel has now inherited Mobileye's problems, and we don't think Intel has the capacity to fix Mobileye's issues.""All those views may be too short-sighted, however.What Intel Sees in MobileyeKrzanichjustified the decisionto INTC shareholders by saying:""It's important now, because if you take a look at what you're doing - talking about car models in 2020, 2021 - and so we need to get in there. We need to get this platform developed, brought to them, and have that confidence so that we can really influence the real start of autonomous driving in that time frame.""He's right, in all ways.He's right in the sense that although self-driving cars aren't exactly new, the market isn't gelled yet - there's room for new players to step up and shape what the future of autonomous driving looks like. Better for Intel to shape it on its terms then end up chasing the lead pace set by the likes ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).He's also right in the sense that by 2020/2021, the landscape of the self-driving car market is going to look radically different. Not only will the market leaders be well-entrenched by then, there's going to massive growth in the number of autonomous cars on the road by that time.How massive? BCG recently crunched some numbers, concluding thatby 2035 annual sales of fully autonomous vehicles will reach 12 million. Annual sales of partially-autonomous cars will rise to 18 million by that point.Investors won't have to wait that long to see big-time growth, though. BCG thinks the market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. At the end of the timeframe, roughly a fourth of all new cars sold will offer autonomous driving features.In a separate study, Lux Research concluded that,by 2030, the self-driving automobile market will be worth $87 billion. Lux added that software developers will be the biggest winners of the movement. Making the hardware work is the hard part.With Mobileye now under its wing, Intel has access to a full-blown platform - complete with software - it didn't have before.Bottom Line for INTC StockIt's not a deal that's going to pay dividends (literally or figuratively) tomorrow, or even next year. Give it two years, though, or even five years for the autonomous car market to mature. It's coming, and it's going to be big. It's far easier and far more affordable for Intel to stake its claim now than it will be to try and break into the market later.Tesla: Trade TSLA With Less RiskIf nothing else, Intel wanted to make sure it made Mobileye its own rather than risk letting a competitor get hold of the up-and-coming company. The value will be there eventually.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Huge M&A Deals That Should Happen ImmediatelyThe postMobileye NV (MBLY) Didn't Come Cheap.

Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?;3/14/2017;"Thanks to its$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY), Intel (INTC) is no longer on the outside looking in when it comes to the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.While Intel’s semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should accelerate the pace of Mobileye’s technology innovation, will the combined company have enough tread to catch the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL)?Intel seems to think so. The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, ""merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”makeArticleAd();Investors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, hasspent $250 millionin R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.Still, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, GooglelaunchedWaymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.These updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s (AAPL) own autonomous car ambitions, which theWall Street Journalrecently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.But here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.At the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brainsinsidethe car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era."

1 Chart That Suggests Tesla Needs to Invest More in Support Infrastructure;3/14/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has an ambitious and compelling vision of vertically integrating sales and service. Hatred of the traditional car buying experience is universal, and service departments at dealerships aremajor profit centers. But pulling off the execution of that vision is far easier said than done, and requires significant investments in infrastructure as well as talent. No one should ever have to wait nearlyeight monthsto get their car repaired.Digging through Tesla's SEC filings, there are data points that could suggest that Tesla needs to be investing more aggressively in customer support.makeArticleAd();Tesla technicians performing service on a Model S. Image source: Tesla.A numbers gameFair warning: This will be an imperfect analysis, mostly due to imperfect public data. First, I took a look at cumulative vehicle shipments over time, excluding the original Roadster that only sold about 2,500 units. While cumulative unit sales are generally not a great proxy for installed base because some units are inevitably retired over time, Tesla's cumulative unit sales may be closer than other examples since cars tend to have longer useful lives and the company only started shipping the Model S less than five years ago. This isn't a small consumer electronics device that you get rid of after two years. It's not perfect, but it's the closest proxy we can get.Tesla also reports the total number of sales and service locations that it operates. It would be more useful to distinguish between sales and service, but for reporting purposes the company aggregates all locations. Third-party authorized body shops are not included in these figures, as Tesla does not report how large its network is. Here's a chart of both cumulative unit sales and Tesla stores and service centers over the past five years.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.However, if you divide cumulative unit sales by Tesla-operated locations, then it starts to make sense why Tesla's support infrastructure is somewhat strained right now. Cumulative units per location rose from 91.5 in 2012 to 693.2 in 2016.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by author.Again, this analysis is less than ideal since investors only have Tesla's public disclosures to work with. It does not account for geographical differences or concentrations, it cannot distinguish between sales and service locations, and the installed base is certainly less than the roughly 184,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that Tesla has delivered through the end of 2016. It's also not as if locations should scale linearly with deliveries. But directionally on average, it stands to reason that Tesla's support infrastructure growth has not kept pace with delivery growth, which in turn leads to backlogs within the network.It's also worth noting that Tesla measures many other internal metrics to assess service quality -- metrics that public investors are not privy to. For example, head of sales and service Jon McNeillrecently notedthat 20% of jobs at Tesla's Palo Alto center are completed before the customer can finish a cup of coffee, and that Tesla's overall parts backlog has been reduced by over 80%. These are also important data points, but they aren't the sort that investors get regular updates on.Model 3 will need even greater supportMeanwhile, Tesla does not break out its capital spending in detail, either, so it's hard to gauge how much the company is investing in support infrastructure. It goes without saying that areas like Gigafactory and Model 3 tooling are the top priorities, but beyond that it's less clear. Here's CFO Jason Wheeler, who recently announced he was leaving Tesla to pursue opportunities in public policy, responding to an analyst question on capital expenditure categories on the last earnings call:We don't break down, we don't disclose the specifics here, but obviously Gigafactory and Model 3 are going to be the biggest investments. We've also got CapEx investments soon, equipment and tooling related to Model 3. But then also there's going to be a piece in CapEx on building out our service and our retail infrastructure as well. And the Supercharger network. So it is the usual suspects.Given the looming Model 3 production ramp that remains on track, perhaps Tesla should be allocating more capital expenditures to expanding support infrastructure.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Intel Needed To Own Mobileye - Even If It Overpaid;3/14/2017;"Painfully, Intel (INTC) has little to no presence in mobile devices, save for a few modem chips here and there. Most everything on mobile devices is ARM-based due to its lower power consumption and cheaper costs. Intel and its -x86 platform simply cannot compete on price or power performance.Having realized this, Intel has decided to do what any company in its position should do -- try and buy its way into the future, acquiring Mobileye (MBLY) for $15.3 billion.No Matter the CostmakeArticleAd();The acquisition, which is being billed as helping Intel turn into a data company (whatever that means), isn't likely to move the financial needle for Intel anytime soon.Mobileye generated just $240.6 million in revenue in fiscal 2016. By comparison, Intel's full year revenue was $59.4 BILLION and its Data Center Group (which Intel is saying Mobileye will fit into) had $17.2 billion in sales.The Israeli-based Mobileye generated $108.4 million in GAAP net income in 2016, making the deal worth 141 times net income. That isn't exactly cheap, even if Mobileye is growing revenues at 46% year over year.This deal is about the future of the car, one that will generate more data (thus needing more computing power) than at any time in history. Intel said cars could generate as much as four terabytes of data per day, so it's important cars have the computing power to understand and make sense of all that data.Mobileye is best known for its role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), having worked with companies like Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), BMW (in conjunction with Intel) and others to bring self-driving cars to the forefront. (In 2017, another 6 OEMs will come online using Mobileye's chips, according to Jefferies analyst David Kelley.)Limited ImpactThis deal isn't likely to hurt Nvidia (NVDA), which makes GPUs for self-driving cars or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NXP (NXPI), which also makes chipsets for cars. Chips for ADAS systems and the cameras that go into them is a much smaller market than being the brains of a self-driving car platform. However, it's clear that Intel needed to do something to get into this space, or risk losing out like it did with mobile devices.There is still the risk that car manufacturers will cut Mobileye's units out of its cars (as happened with Tesla), but with Intel's muscle behind it, that seems less likely to happen. Mobileye has deals with a number of auto manufacturers, including Volkswagen and BMW, enough to get its EyeQ chips into 16 million cars by the end of 2016.Ultimately, this is a deal Intel had to do. It missed out on buying Nvidia when it should have, as it was too focused on the Altera acquisition. It can't buy AMD (AMD) because of the implications for the PC market and -x86 chips.The PC market has had little to no growth for quite some time now, leading PC chip makers to wonder what's next. Intel's latest acquisition of automotive chip maker Mobileye shows that under Brian Krzanich, Intel is focusing on the future -- no matter what it costs."

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First;3/13/2017;"There's no shortage of technology companies and automotive   makers that are are betting that autonomous vehicles will   transform both of their industries. But how do you figure   out which companies are poised to benefit the most?To answer that, investors first need to know what the market   potential is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and   how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then   determine which driverless car investment angle they want to   take. Here are a few steps to help you get started:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be     worthBy 2025, the driverless car market is expected to be worth $42   billion, according to Boston Consulting Group. The market size   jumps up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestimates that there will be 76 million autonomous vehicles   already on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless cars are expected to   transform ride sharing services, allow car owners to rent out   their own vehicles -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has suggested -- and even help   traditional carmakers create their own ride hailing services,   likeFord(NYSE: F) has proposed.This might slow driverless car stocks downIt's not going to be all sunshine and lollipops for driverless   car stocks though. There are still many hurdles facing these   companies, including federal regulations, safety concerns, and   consumer adoption issues.The two biggest automotive markets, however -- the U.S. and   China -- have thus far been very open to driverless cars. Back in   September, the federal government released guidelines for states   to help ensure that companies are able to innovate and not be   hampered by differing rules across state lines. But the problem   is that we're still in the very early stages of driverless   car technology (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fully autonomous   vehicles), so while the government is open to it now, that could   change when more tech starts being used by the general   population.And even if the government doesn't end up stifling autonomous   vehicles, there's currently a growing movement toban driverless cars in New Yorkbecause people are afraid they'll eliminate jobs for taxi   drivers, bus drivers and others in the transportation sector. Add   to that the fact that there are parts of the population thatfeel very uneasyabout driverless cars and it's clear that the autonomous vehicle   market still has a long way to go.There are plenty of ways to investCompanies like Tesla are among the obvious choices for betting   on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to have a   fully autonomous car capable of driving itself across the country   by 2018, and every new Tesla built right now already has the   hardware capabilities for full autonomy (though not all of the   software is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another clear choice. Google's   parent company recently spun out its driverless car segment into   its own company,called Waymo, and is working to bring fully autonomous minivans to the roads   this year for public testing, along with a ride-sharing   service.And then there are chipmakers likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence and its own supercomputers to power driverless cars.   The company'sDrive PX 2 supercomputeris already used by 80 automakers and automotive suppliers   (including Tesla) and is likely to expand its automotive revenues   substantially in the coming years.Of course, you could go the traditional route too and bet on   automakers like Ford, which is also focusing its attention on   self-driving technologies. The company recently invested $1   billion in a self-driving car start-up, called Argo AI, and says   that it will release its own fully autonomous vehicle (with no   steering wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be taking a slower approach than some other   self-driving tech makers, but it has plans to have 90   self-driving test vehicles on the road this year and is working   with more than 40 start-ups on driverless car technology.And if you're looking for a driverless car stock outside of   the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU)  isprobably your best bet. The company has been developing self-driving technology for   years and just launched a test program in some Chinese cities to   implement its tech. The company wants to release a fully   self-driving car by next year with the hopes of having a   ride-hailing service in the coming years. Aside from its   aggressive driverless car approach, Baidu benefits from China's   openness to self-driving technologies and fewer regulations for   road tests than the U.S.Here's how long you might need to wait for this to play     outAlright, so now we know how big this market will be, some of   the potential hurdles, and who the key players are. So how long   will investors have to wait for this opportunity to pan out? IHS   estimates that we'll reach worldwide driverless car ubiquity by   about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car   stocks to benefit of course, but it does mean that we still have   a long way to go before the market will mature -- which makes now   the perfect time for investors to start considering driverless   car stocks.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will NVIDIA Stock Benefit from Intel's Acquisition of Mobileye?;3/13/2017;"When semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp.INTCannounced its acquisitionof Israeli self-driving car firm Mobileye NVMBLY, it sent shock waves through the tech, automaker, and driverless car industries. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Intel and Mobileye have a storied past, working together on various projects in the past. Last July, the two companies announced a partnership with BMW with the goal of putting autonomous cars on the streets by 2021, and then in November, they partnered with auto parts maker DelphiDLPHto create the Automated Driving Group, building a self-driving car system that can be sold to automakers.With this type of partnership in mind, Intel and Mobileye's biggest competitor going forward will be NVIDIA Corp.NVDAand its collaboration with Tesla Inc.TSLA. NVIDIA is best known for its gaming and smartphone graphics chips, but like Intel, the company has been developing computing hardware for cars.Last September, NVIDIA announced its Xavier supercomputer chip, which is powered by the 512-core Volta GPU intended for use in self-driving vars. The chip maker also announced its PX 2 water-cooled ""supercomputer,"" which Tesla employs in its electric vehicles.NVIDIA works closely with Volkswagen'sVLKAYAudi unit and Daimler AGDDAIFwithin the driverless car industry, too.So, what does this mean for NVDA stock?Just today, shares of NVDA closed up 2.75% to $101.85 per share, and though the stock has stumbled a bit in 2017, it has absolutely skyrocketed over the past one, three, and five years, up 207%, 441%, and 580%, respectively.Today's upward movement could be because investors are betting that Intel's Mobileye buyout is validation of the driverless industry as a whole, as well as NVIDIA's ""own dominance and expertise in the autonomous driving sector,""notesForbes.NVIDIA was one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 last year, and there's a very good chance it could perform that way again in 2017.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Self-Driving Car Race: Intel Buys Mobileye for $15 Billion;3/13/2017;"Intel CorporationINTCon Monday announced it struck a deal to acquire driver assistance technology company Mobileye N.V.MBLYfor roughly $15.3 billion. The deal marks the next step in the driverless car race.Mobileye's stock is up 29.43% in early afternoon trading on Monday to $61.19 per share, near its all-time high. Intel's stock dropped 2.31% to $35.08 per share.Mobileye specializes in chip-based camera systems called ""artificial vision sensors."" The technology alerts drivers in real-time to potential road hazards, like pedestrians. The company claims that the sensor technology is 99% accurate and helps prevent accidents. It is working towards putting this technology into self-driving car technology in the future. Mobileye currently helps support over 15 million vehicles.Israel-based Mobileye was founded in 1999 and it went public in July 2014. The IPO came after Mobileye began to invest in driverless car technology. The company'scurrent market capis nearly $10.5 billion. In amemo to employees, Mobileye executives said Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, and existing Israel leaders will head up the efforts.Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a ""leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,"" according to a company statement Monday. ""Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""Mobileye previously worked with Tesla, Inc.TSLAto help power the electric carmaker's Autopilot technology. Thetwo companies parted waysafter a Tesla driver died in a car crash on May 7, 2016, while using its Autopilot feature.The deal comes afterMobileye partneredwith self-driving technology company Delphi Automotive in Aug. 2016. The two companies plannedto create an affordable self-driving car platform to sell to carmakers by 2019. In Nov. 2016,Intel announcedthat Mobileye and Delphi would use its processors.Intel, Mobileye and German automaker BMW AG partnered to test 40 self-driving cars, which could possibly lead to production by 2021.Intel's purchase helps the technology giant begin to compete in therace towards autonomous car technology.Last year, in the self-driving race, General MotorsGMspent $1 billion to purchase Cruise Automation. Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million. QUALCOMM IncorporatedQCOM, an Intel competitor, recently bought NXP Semiconductors N.V.NXPI, a leading semiconductor supplier to the automotive industry.In Nov. 2016, Samsung Electronics Co. bought Harman International Industries Inc. for $8 billion to move into the automotive vehicle space.Waymo, the self-driving car company that split off from Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.GOOG,asked a federal courtrecently to stop Uber Technologies Inc.'s from developing autonomous vehicles. Waymo claims that Uber stole proprietary design secrets. The lawsuit states that a former manager of Google's self-driving car project took documents before quitting to start the self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired quickly.Intel bought security-software company McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion in 2011. The company sold McAfee for a major loss in 2016.After missing out on the rise of the smartphone, Intel has fought to try and stay ahead of the next big technology. Intel is betting big on driverless car technology. The company purchased Israel-based 3D video technology company Replay Technologies in March 2016.Intel announcedin April 2016 it would lay off 11% of its workforce to in order to cut costs and to free up capital to invest in new businesses. In January, Intel announced it would purchase a 15% stake in digital mapmaker Here International B.V., joining BMW AG and Volkswagen AG'sVLKAYAudi, to further the development in the real-time technology needed to improve self-driving car technology.Auto part suppliers are doing well today in the wake of the Intel and Mobileye deal.

2 Things Tesla Is Doing to Improve Body Repair Times;3/13/2017;"Long body repair times are unfortunately all too common forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) customers. Third-party body shops often attribute   delays to waiting on parts from Tesla, while Tesla in some cases   says the body shops are responsible for the delays. My own body   repair experience was terrible, lasting acouple days shy of eight months, and Tesla's response provided toElectrekmostly attempted to pin blame on the body shop.Beyond my specific case, the broader issue is that Tesla's   support infrastructure for body repairs is strained. But the good   news is that Tesla is planning on making some much-needed   improvements to how repairs are handled.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();""applying brute force""In a thread on Tesla Motors Club regarding my article, Tesla   President of Global Sales and Service Jon McNeillposted a responseand outlined a ""roadmap"" for improvement. McNeill noted two   important things that Tesla is planning on doing to improve the   situation (emphasis added):We know from complaints that the body shop experience needs     to get a lot better -- and fast.What the service team has done so far is a roadmap of how     we're going to fix the autobody experience. Wait times for     appointments measured in hours and a handful of days currently.     We're providing same-day service from the Bay Area to Oslo and     everywhere in between. In fact, almost 20% of jobs in our     flagship center in Palo Alto are handled before the customer     can finish their cup of coffee (yes, you read that correctly).Thankfully, only a handful of our owners experience accidents     each year. Since customers schedule and interface with the body     shops on their own, we're largely blind to the service pace.Most of the customer complaints about body shops mentioned     parts, so we focused on this issue. To date, we've reduced     backlog by over 80%.Even though we reduced part wait times, we continued to dig     into the body shop complaints. What we found was astounding --     cars sat at body shops for weeks and sometimes months before     the body shops took action and, more often than not, the body     shops blaming Tesla for parts delays were the very shops that     hadn't even ordered parts or started the repair.We are applying brute force to this immediately.We will have individuals on our team personally manage     each car on behalf of our customers that are in 3rd party body     shops.We're also going to increase our approved shop count by     300 over the next few weeks as well as eliminating poor     performing shops.If you have an issue with a shop, please PM me directly and our     team will advocate and manage your repair.Tesla owners will get the service they expect from us - period.Thanks to the entire service team for their commitment to     setting the highest standard for service in the industry,JonPart of the issue is that since these are third-party body   shops, Tesla has less visibility into the repair timelines. In   order to mitigate this, Tesla will have employees manage the   repair to ensure that everything is proceeding promptly. Having   an advocate should relieve customers of having to try to navigate   the repair. Perhaps more importantly, Tesla is preparing to add   300 authorized body shops to its network in coming weeks, which   should help alleviate backlogs at body shops. It's not clear how   many third-party authorized body shops Tesla currently has, but   adding more will certainly help.Strengthening the customer support infrastructure is extremely   important ahead of Model 3's launch later this year. Tesla has   learned its lessons from making Model S and Model X overly   complicated, which is why it is taking a more holistic approach   to Model 3 by designing the car from the beginning for both   manufacturability and reparability.Tesla is planning on ordering enough parts from suppliers to   start producing 1,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in July, and this   will quickly ramp to 2,000 per week in August and 4,000 per week   in September. By the end of the year, Tesla hopes to be producing   5,000 per week, which would translate into an annual run rate of   over a quarter million vehicles as it enters 2018. In contrast,   Tesla produced approximately 84,000 vehicles in 2016. That's a   lot more vehicles on the road to support, so getting ahead of   service and repair times will be a key factor in whether or not   the mainstream model succeeds.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Intel Buys Mobileye: Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future?;3/13/2017;"On Monday, semiconductor chip makerIntel Corp.INTCannounceda huge move in the self-driving car race, buying Israeli firmMobileye NVMBLYfor a reported $15.3 billion. The deal values Mobileye at about $63.54 per share, which is a 34% premium to its closing price last Friday. MBLY stock skyrocketed around 30% to $61.35 per share in morning trading on Monday, while shares of INTC were down about 2% to $35.22 per share.Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Not only is this acquisition a huge deal for Intel, but it's also an endorsement of both the Israeli tech scene as well as the entire self-driving vehicle industry as a whole. Big-name automakers like TeslaTSLA, General MotorsGM, Volkswagen'sVLKAYAudi unit, VolvoVLVLY, and Ford MotorsF, among many others, are racing to get a self-driving car model on the road, while tech giants like AlphabetGOOGLand Uber sprinting just as fast to perfect the technology behind the cars.Last year, GM spent $1 billion to speed up its self-driving program with the acquisition of Cruise Automation, while Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million last August. These two transactions are just the tip of the iceberg, and with 2020 fast approaching, we should expect even more deals from the biggest players in the driverless car marketIf the necessary regulations are in place, 2020 is the year every company, tech and automaker, in the race plans to have a working self-driving car-or fleet-on the road.Intel and Mobileye already have previous ties, having partnered with German automaker BMW AG to test about 40 self-driving cars on the road. It will be interesting to see which automaker will be lucky enough to be able to utilize the new entity's technology.The deal will add to Intel's adjusted per share earnings, and is expected to close in the next nine months.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rev Up Free Profits from Ford Motor Company (F) Stock;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year, I delivered results tradingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), the easiest of which was a range trade thatyielded 50%. This year I am chasing a potential breakout that has been slowly developing.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Ford has good management pedigree. They weathered the effects of the 2008 financial crisis as well as could be expected. For the last few years we've had record vehicle sales.Therein lies my frustration with this breakout. Everything is going the auto manufacturing industry, yet their stocks have yet to wow us. Ford stock has been in a descending trend for almost two years.Click to EnlargeEquity markets are at all-time highs. With auto sales also at or near record levels, I expect better performance from F stock. For some reason it's mired under $13 and in a descending trend.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM), on the other hand, has enjoyed an ascending 12 month trend.Even so, I still like the Ford trade better.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsTechnically, the recent price action in F stock has been building energy. We see lower highs and higher lows coming to a tight point. This energy needs to resolve itself soon. Unless there is bad news coming from Ford or a general equity correction, the move should be to the upside.If that happens, it could rally 8% to 10%. Today I want to set a pair trade to capture the upside breakout.F Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Buy the F May $13 call for 23 cents per contract. This will give me over two months to capture an upside move.To lower my out-of-pocket expenses, I will finance the bet by selling risk against lower levels of Ford that I deem safe given the current environment.The Bank:Sell the F Sept $11 put and collect 35 cents. This is a bullish trade that commits me to buying F stock if price falls below it. I have an 85% theoretical chance of having F stock stay above my sold put. I only sell naked puts if I am willing to own it there.Taking both trades means that I am getting paid to bet on a Ford stock rally. Even if nothing happens, I would be left with a net credit. As long as the price stays above $11 per share, any premium I collect from selling back the May call is pure profit.Since I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration, I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

The Simple Reason Why I Won't Buy Tesla;3/11/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is, arguably, the quintissential story stock. I   know, I know... that's not exactly a revelation at this point.   Elon Musk set out to create a world powered by renewable energy   and filled with electric vehicles, told us about how great it   would be, made itsexy, and now we can't get enough of the vision. But it has its   drawbacks -- such as having an impossible-to-justify   valuation.When confronted with Tesla's ridiculous valuation, bullish   investors counter that there's no comparison to what Musk is   building with the brand. That's true, but I find the argument to   be dangerous, not because I don't appreciate what the company is   attempting to accomplish, but because analysts and investors   aren't appreciating that the company could fail to accomplish   what it's attempting.A gaudy (and simply ridiculous) valuation is the simple reason   why I won't buy Tesla, and I think other investors may feel the   same way.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Price is what you payThe just-released full-year 2016 earnings showed impressive   year-over-year growth and promised even more in the first-half of   2017. The Model 3 launch in July and subsequent production   ramp-up in the fourth quarter of this year have the potential to   really push growth to the next level.Throw in a simultaneous ramp-up of energy storage products   from Gigafactory 1, and it's easy to see why investors are   excited. But is all of this worth$40 billion of excitement?Tesla is now worth nearly as much asFord Motor CompanyandGeneral Motors-- established automakers that sell more cars in less than one   month than the company did in all of 2016.TSLA Market Capdata byYCharts.Investors could argue that offering the first mass-market   electric vehicle earns Tesla its enormous valuation, but it's not   a very good argument. Ford and General Motors -- and most major   automakers -- are readying electric vehicles for market launches   in the next several years. Many have plans to greatly expand   their offerings of electric vehicles in the next 10 to 15   years.For instance, the Chevy Bolt, which has a starting price of   $37,495 and offers a 238-mile range, promises to give the Model 3   a run for its money. It became available in two states last   December and will increase its footprint this year.Meanwhile, Ford has an""electrification"" strategythat will gradually transition the automaker to hybrid and fully   electric vehicles over the next decade. The Ford Fusion Energi   was the fourth best-selling electric vehicle in the United States   through the first 10 months of last year.In addition to direct competition, electric vehicles sold by   companies other than Tesla will eat away at the company's revenue   stream provided by Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits, which are   sold to comply with regulatory obligations in certain states. In   2016, these accounted for $302 million in revenue. It may not   seem like much, but given the revenue is essentially cost free,   ZEV credit sales accounted for 19% of the company's gross profit   last year.What about non-transportation growth?Investors could argue that, aside from leading the way on   electric vehicles, Tesla's hefty valuation is partially earned   from leading the way in solar power and energy storage. The   annual update letter certainly showed impressive growth last   year.What it didn't show is that the company appears to be   abandoning plans to manufacture Silveo modules, and will instead   purchase ""custom made modules"" from Panasonic, according to an   agreement signed in December 2016. That could result in a   significant writedown of the acquisition costs and technology   development.The update letter also doesn't mention that Tesla's   energy-storage ambitionsaren't realistic from a technical standpoint. In addition to thermodynamic obstacles from specific   lithium-ion chemistries, researchers who have crunched all of the   detailed numbers don't think there will be much -- if any --   battery cost-reduction benefit from building larger battery   factories. That should make investors a little uncomfortable,   especially considering cost reductions were a crucial argument   defending billions of dollars in expenses for building   Gigafactory 1.Why Tesla isn't for meTesla's reliance on storytelling is offputting to me, doubly   so when it results in a $40 billion market cap that is impossible   to really justify. Investors continue to overvalue the potential   of imaginative solar roofs and uneconomical residential energy   storage. However, the real drivers for the company's renewable   energy strategy are more likely to be riding the continued growth   in traditional residential solar and selling energy storage   products into niche markets, such as peak demand stop gaps for   utility companies. Even then, the market opportunity is less --   and the competition more -- than investors properly gauge.Shareholders today may benefit from the Musk Halo Effect --   which attaches a premium valuation to, or boosts, public goodwill   of companies and projects he's involved with -- but that doesn't   mean investors should bank on it lasting indefinitely. It's the   simple reason why I won't be buying Tesla.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Tesla Can Fix Its Flawed Solar Business;3/11/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisition of SolarCity was touted as a way to   vertically integrate the EV company into a one-stop renewable   energy provider for customers. Walk in a Tesla retail store, and   you can walk out with an electric car run on electricity from   your roof that was stored all day in your Powerwall.The reality of solar in 2017 is that SolarCity's business   model is dying. The lease/power purchase agreement (PPA) that   made SolarCity so popular in the first place is being replaced by   loan and cash sales, which are better served by smaller   installers. Sales are becoming harder as the low-hanging fruit   has already been nabbed by a highly competitive industry. The old   SolarCity isn't what it used to be.What's interesting are the new solar products that SolarCity   started working on, and Tesla is finishing. The solar   manufacturing plant that's supposed to build high-efficiency   solar panels in Buffalo, New York, and the new solar roof   product, which will eventually pair with the Powerwall to create   a holistic energy solution are a path forward for Tesla. But the   installation and sales wings of the solar business have become a   weight Tesla should no longer be willing to hold.makeArticleAd();Tesla's solar roof is a big product coming in 2017. Image     source: Tesla.Tesla should cut thousands of jobsThis sounds dramatic, but don't worry, there's still lots of   work for people to do installing Tesla solar systems. However,   maybe it doesn't make sense for them to do that work under   Tesla's umbrella.When SolarCity built out its solar business, it put most of   its work into building out a sales force that could sell solar   systems and an installation force that could put them up. The   large, national solar model was working and did until the end of   2015. But,according to GTM Research, the top three solar installers in the country grew at just 10%   in 2016 while all other installers grew 53%. Tesla/SolarCity's   decline is even more pronounced with deployments falling from253 MW in Q4 2015to201 MW in Q4 2016.Image source:GTM Research.This isn't necessarily a problem because Tesla would like to   automate the sales process, or move it into Tesla's stores. So,   it makes sense for fewer for Tesla workers to be selling   door-to-door the way SolarCity did.On the installation side, Tesla could offload work to hundreds   of contracting partners the do the actual installation work   rather than having the team in-house. Owning the installation   side of the business means Tesla is taking on the operating costs   of hiring workers and buying installation equipment, and it has   to constantly keep those workers busy. If this work was   contracted out, it would lower risk and potentially lower costs   as contractors compete for business.This wouldn't be a novel approach. Most of the construction   business works on this contractor model, whether it's building a   home or replacing a roof or a kitchen. And with small solar   installers taking market share from Tesla, it would be wise for   it to lower its operating risk.The Powerwall could be the center of a new solar strategy at     Tesla. Image source: Tesla.Create a pre-engineered solution that can     scaleIf Tesla moved to a business model that contracted out work,   it would need to create an easy-to-install solution for   contractors. And that is already on the way with the   development of the Powerwall and the solar panels made in-house.   Soon, Tesla will be more vertically integrated than any other   full service solar company (including energy storage) so the   company could offer a suite of solutions few companies could even   dream of matching.Gigafactory 2, the Buffalo solar plant, will soon be making   solar panels, and Tesla now owns the racking company for solar   systems. These products could be pre-engineered into a solution   that would be sold to smaller contractors. Even the Powerwall   would fit into this model, and Tesla could provide services to be   the brains behind making the Powerwall economically viable.The Solar Roof could be another extension of this model, a   product that could be sold through contractors without having to   train in-house installers on the product.Creating a pre-engineered solution for contractors could   create a highly scalable business for Tesla, which would   potentially lead to a bigger solar footprint overall, which is   Musk's goal, after all.Ditch the solar leaseIf Tesla is serious about turning the solar business into a   cash-flow business, it should eliminate the lease, or power   purchase agreement. This would be turning its back on the   financing model that made SolarCity popular, but the lease is   losing market share rapidly, and it's not a product Tesla wants   to have on its balance sheet anyway.Lease financing has become unattractive over time becauseSolarCity's borrowing costs were rising. Without low borrowing costs the lease has no advantage over a   loan and with loan rates on the decline there no reason to keep   the lease in the portfolio.If Tesla moved to a contractor model for installations, it   could offload the financing of solar systems to third-party   banks, who are already entering the market, and count on cash up   front with each sale. This way, management and investors could   judge the solar business on its margins and cash-flow generation   rather than a questionable metric like retained value.Tesla would be better with a more focused solar     businessIf Elon Musk wants to create a successful solar business long   term, he should de-risk the business by getting out of   installation and high-intensity sales. Instead, focusing the   company on making great products and providing the services   contractors need to sell them would be a move in the right   direction. Investors would likely cheer the move.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 5 Biggest Challenges to the Driverless Car Revolution;3/11/2017;"The year 2017 is gearing up to be a momentous year for the   driverless car race. But despite major initiatives by   megacorporationsAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road blocks ahead   for the driverless car revolution. A recentMcKinseyreport highlights five of them.1. PricingNo matter how incredible an innovation might be, it's useless   if it's not affordable. Although Alphabet's Waymo has clocked   more than 2 million road miles in its autonomous vehicles,   McKinsey estimates that self-driving cars are ""unlikely to be   available before 2020."" Alphabet and others are inching closer to   commercializing their products. A partnership withFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet's autonomous   driving technology out of its peculiar ""panda car"" and into 100   Pacifica Hybrid minivans in early 2017. But those minivans aren't   for sale, and, if they were, would probably cost magnitudes more   than an average minivan.2. Consumer UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless cars become affordable, no one will buy   them if they don't understand them. That means that self-driving   car companies need to educate consumers on the advantages of   autonomous vehicles. Informational videos like the one above   produced by Alphabet's Waymo are an important start, and others   like Tesla Motors are producing their ownvideo vignettesto make self-driving cars salient. Tesla Motors and others have a   clear business incentive to make self-driving seem mainstream,   and the more that their message is spread, the brighter the   future for their sales and sustainability.3. Safety/Security issuesConsumer understanding goes hand in hand with a major concern   about autonomous technology -- safety and security. At no point   was this clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motors reported the   first driver fatality while its Autopilot technology was engaged.   The tragic crash occurred when neither the driver nor Tesla   Motors' technology recognized a truck's white-colored trailer   crossing its path on a highway. There will certainly be more   tragedies in the future of autonomous vehicles, and it will   remain a continuing challenge and the highest priority for   self-driving car companies to minimize safety and security   issues. However, it's also important to remember that these   high-profile cases can cause over-reactions, and sticking to   statistics can help investors, companies, and consumers alike   identify the best autonomous option for investing, manufacturing,   and purchasing.4 & 5: Regulation and TechnologyAs with all new innovations, regulation and technology can   make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note   that regulation is a hurdle, rather than a never-ending issue. It   makes sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo   Cars have all joined together to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets."" Rather than rally for ""wild west"" free market competition,   these companies want to see a sensible framework of standardized   regulation upon which they can confidently build their new   business units.Technology isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold   below which driverless cars will never be the norm.

3 Beaten-up Driverless Cars Stocks: Are They Bargains?;3/10/2017;"By now you probably know that the driverless car is poised for huge growth in the coming years, hitting an estimated market size of $77 billion by 2035.Companies spanning the technology and automotive sectors are jumping on board to ensure that they don't fall behind dominant players likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) andTesla. Investors looking for driverless cars stocks that both have huge potentialandare bargains should considerBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) ,Ford(NYSE: F) , andDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) .makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.BaiduOver the past few years, Baidu has been working on self-driving vehicle technology and positioning itself to be a leader in the autonomous car space in China. Late last year, the company set up a real-world test of its driverless cars with 200 members of the public. It was one of the first of its kind in China, and was one of the biggest self-driving car moves Baidu made since first testing its autonomous vehicles.The company plans to launch a self-driving shuttle service as early as next year, with the goal of mass producing driverless cars by 2021.Image source:YCharts.Unfortunately for Baidu, the company's stock has remained flat over the past 12 months, with less than 1% gains.. In the company's most recent fourth-quarter 2016 earnings report, revenues fell by 2.6%, mainly due to increasing regulations by the Chinese government on how it conducts online searches.But despite the temporary hit to revenue and margins, Baidu's long-term position as a search powerhouse in China and a leader in driverless car technology remains intact.Baidu has a small fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles and has plans to launch more later this year. The company is partnering with NVIDIA to pair its mapping data with NVIDIA's driverless technologies, which should enhance Baidu's driverless capabilities. Add to that the company's relatively low forward P/E ratio of just 23 (compared to the tech industry average of 26) and Baidu looks like a bargain right now.FordFord is taking a slow-and-steady approach to the driverless car market. The company talks a lot about wanting to make sure its technology is safe for its customers before it releases it out into the wild.But that doesn't mean Ford is lagging behind the competition. The company says it'll have a fleet of about 90 autonomous vehicles -- up from 30 -- by the end of this year, and is on track to begin production of a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. Ford says the car won't have a steering wheel and will be used for a ride-hailing service.Image Sourge:YCharts.Ford's stock has fallen by more than 7% over the past year, with the recent stock price drop coming in part from the company's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings report. Ford reported in January that its net income fell by $2.7 billion from the year-ago quarter, and revenues were down by $1.6 billion. But the losses came mainly from one-time charges that the company incurred from canceling a factory in Mexico and pension plan costs.One-time charges aside, Ford is still in a strong position to grow in the driverless cars space, and its $1 billion investment in its new driverless car AI company Argo last month indicates that Ford is more resolute than ever.The company's stock currently trades at forward P/E of just 7.28, much cheaper than the automotive industry average of 13, which easily puts it in the bargain bin.Delphi AutomotiveAs one of the world's largest automotive suppliers Delphi has a front-row seat to the driverless car transformation -- and the company is taking huge steps to bring it about. Delphi makes radar, cameras, and software that help power some of the driverless tech on the roads today, and the company says it will debut fully autonomous vehicle technology by 2019, and have it in vehicles by 2021 or 2022.The company showed off some of its autonomous car tech at the Consumer Electronics Show back in January, which included optical cameras and image processors fromMobileye.Image source:YCharts.While Delphi's stock hasn't exactly lost any ground over the past 12 months -- it's up about 6% in fact -- it's still significantly trailing the S&P 500 (see chart above).Revenue for the company's fourth-quarter 2016 was up by 11% year over year and jumped by 10% for the full-year 2016. Delphi's forward P/E of 10.61 is far below the auto parts industry average of 20. The company certainly has an advantage in working with nearly every major automotive manufacturer, and could be a solid long-term play in the driverless car space.Each of the companies above is betting on the driverless car space in a different way, with varying levels of exposure. But each one's current price, forward P/E, and position in the autonomous car market means they're all worth a look from bargain-shopping investors.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Too Good to Pass Up!;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter a stunning 2016,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is looking like a mere mortal. So far in 2017, Nvidia stock is down 7%-plus. The pause in momentum for the benchmarkTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK), as well as theMarket Vectors Semiconductor ETF(NYSEARCA:SMH), has some growth investors concerned. NVDA stock jumped to the stratosphere, but we all know gravity's beckoning call.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBroader factors that are not directly related to Nvidia shares are also weighing on Wall Street. Military analysts consider North Korea's recentmissile launchesas practice for a potential assault on U.S. bases in Japan.Domestically, allegations about Russian involvement in last year's general election continue to dog President Donald Trump. Furthermore, hiswild accusationof being wiretapped by his predecessor have left both the country and the markets jittery.Technically, Nvidia stock is not providing the best of signals. Since early February, NVDA is down an astonishing 18%. And since Feb. 23, Nvidia shares have been firmly below its 50-day moving average. Traders carefully watch this barometer as an indicator of nearer-term strength. What worries vested parties is that NVDA has largely trended bearishly since breaching this key level.With multiple headwinds working against Nvidia stock, should investors risk exposure or cut tail while the going's good? A little trimming wouldn't hurt, but the overall prognosis still looks promising.Nvidia Stock: Slow Start, Fast FinishLet's start with the technical argument. I would be careful in looking too much into recent momentum. Remember that during last year's record-breaking move, the company didn't jump straight from the gate. Nvidia shares rang in 2016 with a near-17% loss up to mid-February. Back then, not only was NVDA below its 50-day, it was dangerously close to falling below the 200-day.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowRather than being a harbinger for Nvidia stock, that level turned out to be the buying opportunity of a lifetime. History doesn't always repeat itself, that I'll easily concede … but I will also argue that viable investment opportunities maintain a certain cadence. Investors can use this data to determine the likelihood of whether their positions will turn out profitable.Click to EnlargeWhat you should keep in mind is that Nvidia shares are marathon runners, not 100-meter sprinters. Between 2000 through the end of 2016, January returns for NVDA stock averaged less than 1%. By the end of the third quarter, however, NVDA is churning out double-digits at 14%.When the year is finally tallied, investors have taken home 55% average profits. As I said earlier, nearer-term momentum isn't always a reliable barometer.What is a reliable indicator is the first-quarter performance. Only one time did Nvidia stock turn negative at the 90-day mark, and still managed to squeeze out a profit in the full year. So if NVDA stock is in red ink on March 31, then yes, it's time to think about exposure.But if it ends up in the black, I like my chances. Only twice did NVDA do well in the first quarter, and go sour later in the year.The Fundamental Case for NvidiaFundamentally as well, I don't see how you can go wrong with Nvidia stock. The company is integrated with the most exciting developments in digital technologies - automated driving, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. As innovators likeTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, NVDA will be right there.Furthermore, it's unlikely that the company will lose its dominance in its field of specialty. As a result, Nvidia is in good hands. AsBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellierstates:""The company has been in the computer graphics business for more than two decades - it invented the GPU in 1999 - so it is a well-established player. To date, Nvidia owns 7,300 patents relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its kind.""Furthermore, NVDA isn't just innovating, it's finding tremendous success. InvestorPlace contributor Ryan Fuhrmannwritesthat during the fourth quarter, ""Nvidia reported that data center revenue tripled and that AI is being rapidly adopted throughout the world. Total revenue jumped 55% to $2 billion."" Sure, the recent technical slowdown is newsworthy, but come on! You have to look at the bigger picture.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 WorriesAll in all, Nvidia stock is a buying opportunity. I totally get the concerns about acquiring NVDA at a lofty price point. However, I don't consider it to be a ""trap valuation."" The company witnessed incredible success and they have a proven track record. Any weakness is a natural correction toward the next leg up.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to Buy8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownThe postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Too Good to Pass Up!appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why You Should Bet on Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Stock;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) have tracked higher year-to-date alongside the broader stock market. While CRM stock remains constructively positioned through the intermediate to longer-term lens, in the near-term, it has reached better technical resistance that must be respected until cleared.makeArticleAd();Traders and active investors alike may be bullish, but they also would be wise to exercise patience.When I last discussed shares of Salesforce.com on Oct. 7, 2016, I pointed to the near-term weakness in the stock at the time lining up with multiyear technical support. I said the bullish reversal from Oct. 5-6 pointed toward a next upside target at $76, followed by $80.Over the ensuing weeks, both upside targets were reach, and the trade had run its course.CRM Stock ChartsLooking at the weekly chart below, CRM stock - viewed through a multiyear lens - very much qualifies as a ""trend following"" stock. In other words, it's a stock that over the years has trended higher in a very orderly and well-defined channel.Click to EnlargeI often repeat to my direct members and clients: Trend following can be one of the most rewarding trading and investing strategies if one learns to focus on those stocks or assets that offer the most well defined trends. The choppier a trend is, the more challenging investors find it to stick with the trend over time.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuySalesforce stock over the years has offered traders and investors a notably well-defined trend that allowed for reduction of risk at the top end of the trading range, and addition of risk near the lower end of the trend.As such, the lows in CRM stock from the fourth quarter of 2016 coincided with the lower end of the multiyear uptrending channel, which I marked with the two parallels. So far in 2017, Salesforce has strung together an almost creepy orderly rally with just about no volatility.This orderly push higher through a multiyear lens, and from a trend following perspective, ultimately should have higher to go still - namely toward the upper end of the multi-year channel.However, note that CRM shares, for the time being, have reached critical horizontal resistance in the low $80s, which matches up with the 2015 and 2016 highs.Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?On the daily chart, we see that the lows in CRM stock from Q4 2016 in the high $60s formed an important higher low versus the early 2016 lows. Those lows also matched up with a nearly exact 50% retracement of the entire rally from the February 2016 lows in to the May 2016 highs.Click to EnlargeThis paints a constructive backdrop. However, I believe the year-to-date rally right now, to stand a better chance of sustainably overcoming horizontal resistance in the low $80s, might need a bit more consolidation.My specific target? A solid daily close above $84.50 would signal that CRM stock is ready to push higher into the high $80s or low $90s, which marks the upper end of the multiyear uptrending channel.Like what you see?

Breaking Down Tesla's Inventory Increase;3/9/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported fourth-quarter earnings last month, and   one notable line item on the balance sheet was a sequential   increase in the carrying value of its inventory. At the end of   2016, the electric-car maker had nearly $2.1 billion in   inventory, a sequential increase from $1.6 billion in the prior   quarter.The breakdown of inventory isn't disclosed until the   subsequent 10-Q or 10-K is filed after earnings, and Tesla filed   its 10-K earlier this month. Investors can now see the moving   parts.Tesla is now sitting on $1 billion in finished goodsFor starters, here's a breakdown of Tesla's inventory for the   past two quarters.makeArticleAd();InventoryQ3 2016Q4 2016Raw materials$353.8 million$680.3 millionWork in process$330 million$233.7 millionFinished goods$791.6 million$1.02 billionService parts$129.3 million$136.6 millionTotal$1.6 billion$2.1 billionData source: SEC filings.It's worth pointing out real quick that the SolarCity   acquisition closed during the quarter, combining both companies'   balance sheets. SolarCity had about $172.7 million worth of total   inventory (consisting primarily of $141 million in raw materials   and $31.8 million in work in progress) at the end of the year,   which accounts for a portion of the sequential increase.Image source: Tesla.Since SolarCity does not have a finished goods category for   its inventory, we can safely say that the notable increase of   about $225 million in finished goods is coming from the   automotive side. This is the first time that Tesla's finished   goods inventory has surpassed $1 billion.Cars on boatsThis figure includes ""vehicles in transit to fulfill customer   orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail   and service center locations, pre-owned Tesla vehicles, and   energy storage products."" Tesla keeps minimal inventory on hand   relative to traditional car dealers, and cell production for   storage products didn't begin until after the quarter closed.Tesla in Amsterdam. Image source: Tesla.Investors do know that Tesla has been growing its   international sales -- total revenue outside the United States   grew 34% to $2.8 billion in 2016 -- and those orders take longer   to get to their new homes abroad. Reflecting this, vehicles in   transit at the end of each quarter rose throughout 2016.QuarterVehicles in Transit at Quarter EndQ1 20162,615Q2 20165,150Q3 20165,500Q4 20166,450Data source: Tesla.Part of the increase for the fourth quarter was the nearly   1,000 additional vehicles that were probably sitting on a boat in   the middle of the ocean, relative to the third quarter. Tesla   doesn't disclose average transaction prices, but most third-party   estimates peg the average at right around $100,000, which would   suggest that approximately $100 million of the increase can be   tied to the increase in in-transit vehicles.The rest of the increase can probably be explained by a modest   increase in stores and service locations (14 new locations opened   during the quarter) and associated inventory models and loaners,   as well as higher inventories of pre-owned vehicles (pre-owned   vehicle sales are driving the growth in service and other   revenue). Considering Tesla's integrated model and growth, a   ballooning inventory balance is just par for the course.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stocks Mostly Flat as Trump Rattles Wall Street;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities bounced around the unchanged line on Thursday as investors were loath to make any big moves ahead of Friday's pivotal non-farm payrolls report.makeArticleAd();This will be the last read on the jobs market ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting where officials are expected to raise interest rates again for the second time in three months; a serious acceleration of the prior pace of just two rate hikes in the past 10 years.In the end, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained a fraction, theS&P 500added 0.1%, theNasdaq Compositewafted up a fraction and theRussell 2000fell by 0.4%.Treasury bonds were weaker (continuing the worst selloff in more than 40 years), the dollar was mixed, gold declined for the eighth straight session and crude oil continued Wednesday's nasty slide down another 2%. That boosted theProShares UltraShort Crude Oil(NYSEARCA:SCO) recommended toEdgesubscribers to a gain of 12.4% as West Texas Intermediate fell below the $50-a-barrel level for the first time since December following bearish inventory data, increasing U.S. rig activity and a lack of compliance by non-OPEC nations with last year's production freeze agreement.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyDespite this, energy and healthcare led the way with gains of 0.6%.

It forced the separation of riskier investment banking activities from deposit-taking commercial banking activities.While this is widely seen as a good thing for the health of the financial system and the sanctity of savings accounts, it's bad news for the profits hounds on Wall Street.

Bullish on NVIDIA? You'll Love These Stocks;3/9/2017;"Investors kind of have crush onNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) . The company has posted quarter after quarter of   strong sales, grown gaming GPU market share, introduced new   driverless car technologies, and expanded its artificial   intelligence (AI) opportunities -- all of which have led   investors to swoon to the stock, pushing it up over 200% over the   past 12 months.If you're bullish on NVIDIA's prospects in gaming, AI, and   driverless cars, then perhaps you should giveAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andSony(NYSE: SNE) a good look as well. These companies aren't making   the exact same moves as NVIDIA, but each is poised to dominate   one of these segments in their own way.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();An alternative artificial intelligence playNVIDIA is alreadytaking big stepsto make AI a priority through its investments in deep learning   technologies like Drive PX 2 (for cars) and servers   (DGX-1). But it's not the only one who will benefit from the   tech sector's focus on AI. Just look at the size of the   artificial intelligence market over the next few years (hint:   there's plenty of room for lots of winners).Data source:TracticaandStatista.And this is where Amazon comes in. The company has a dedicated   AI team that's already up to the ""thousands,"" according to   Amazon, and an AI focus that hits both the consumer and   enterprise markets.Amazon's Echo may seem like just another consumer product, but   powering the unit is the company's Alexa virtual assistant. Alexa   can answer basic questions, set alarms, check the weather, play   music, and order items from Amazon (of course!). However, Alexa   has also been opened to developers so that other companies can   integrate the AI into their own devices and services, and it has   even started a fund to supply capital to companies that are doing   so.Amazon won't get rich off of selling Alexa-powered devices,   but the assistant is giving the company a leg up in the home   automation space. Amazon is using its AI virtual assistant   to grow its own ecosystem, and it's clear from new rumors ofupcoming Alexa-powered devicesand continual integration of Alexa into other products that the   company will continue to use this AI to tie consumers to its   business.The real AI play for Amazon will be through its web hosting   services, AWS.  The company released several new AI services   to developers at its re:Invent conference a few months ago,   including an image-recognition platform and a text-to-speech   service. And, most importantly, the company released a program   that allows developers to create AI chatbots capable of   multilevel conversations, similar to Alexa.These are all important because as Amazon releases these tools   into the wild, it expects to be paid back through developers   using those AI systems by hosting them through AWS.Amazon brought in $3.53 billion with AWS in Q4 2016 -- an   increase of 47% year over year -- and with more complex AI   systems being built now and into the future, the company will   benefit from all of those AI systems needing a robust cloud   hosting service.Don't expect Amazon's AI strategies to be an immediate payoff,   but the company is taking big steps now with Alexa and its AI   tools for developers to build a strong artificial intelligence   foundation for the future.An alternative driverless car playNVIDIA bulls know that driverless cars will likely play a big   role in the company's future, and part of that opportunity stems   from the company's recent partnership with electric car maker   Tesla. The automaker's self-driving technologies are powered   by NVIDIA's Drive PX 2 supercomputer, along with Tesla's own   ""neural net for vision, sonar, and radar processing.""Tesla's driverless car play is a bit more hands-on than   NVIDIA's, but it's no less important. CEO Elon Musk has said   that his company will bring a fully autonomous vehicle to market   by 2018, and he has also mentioned that Tesla owners will be able   torent out their autonomous vehiclesin the near future, when they're not using them.That's more than just lip service, of course. Tesla already   manufactures its latest models with fully autonomous hardware   built into every new vehicle, and it's slowly releasing new   software updates as it gathers more driving data. All of this   hardware -- and the release of new software -- means Tesla is   already a few steps ahead of the driverless car competition.An alternative gaming and VR playOf course, gaming is one of NVIDIA's biggest opportunities.   The company already brings in 62% of its total revenue from its   gaming segment, and the growing virtual reality market could help   NVIDIA continue its gaming success. By 2020, the VR market will   be worth an estimated $70 billion.Investors looking for an alternative VR play should consider   Sony's recent lead in the space. The company released its first   VR headset just four months ago, and it recently reported that it   has already sold 915,000 units. For comparison's sake, the   Oculus Rift has sold an estimated 243,000 units, and the HTC   Vive has sold 420,000, according to Superdata Research.That's notable because Sony's PlayStation VR headset sales are   one of the first huge hardware successes for VR, and they are on   track to surpass the company's own estimate of selling 1 million   headset in the first six months.Still, hardware VR sales will eventually be eclipsed by VR   software sales, and that's why Sony truly has a great opportunity   in virtual reality. The company is already working with 230   developers and content creators to build VR games and content for   its gaming console, and it already has more than 70 VR games.Sony has identified virtual reality as one of the keys tobuilding out its important Game and Network   Services division, and the initial numbers from its VR headset sales are a good   indicator that the company is moving quickly in that   direction.Of course, there's no guarantee the stocks listed above will   have the same success NVIDIA's had recently. Nor are Amazon,   Tesla, or Sony making the exact same moves that NVIDIA is. But if   you're looking to tap into AI, driverless cars, and virtual   reality, then you should certainly consider how each one of these   companies is poised to dominate their respective markets.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Is Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) Stock Dropping After a Great Q4?;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptimism was high as trading closed March 9 and investors waited for the fourth-quarter earnings report fromUlta Beauty Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA) - especially aftere.l.f. Beauty Inc(NYSE:ELF), another cosmetics company, rose 12% after reporting earnings the day before.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBut ULTA stock didn't enjoy the same hurrah.Ulta - which changed its name from Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance in January when itadopted a new holding company structure- was looking for revenue of $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion for the January quarter, and earnings per share of from $2.08 per share to $2.13. The ""whisper number"" on earnings was even higher,at $1.57 per share. The revenue would represent sales growth for the beauty chain of 12% to 14%, outstanding for a retailer.The stock chart has been attractive, too, showing higher highs and higher lows for some time.Everything seemed set up for success, and continued bullishness for ULTA stock.Ulta by the NumbersWhile impressive on their face, traders treated the numbers as a miss, taking down the stock more than 4% in after-hours trading, after trading it down slightly during the day.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 WorriesUlta said it had earnings of $140.018 million, $2.25 per share, on revenue of $1.58 billion.

It came public in 2007 at about $30 per share, and while it has paid only one dividend, in 2012, its value has increased over eight-fold to its recent level of about $274.Ulta has really taken off since Mary Dillon, a former cellular chain with experience atMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) andPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP), became CEO in 2013. Revenues have doubled, to nearly $4 billion per year, and margins have held level, with about 8% of revenue hitting the net income line.While other retailers have faded, Ulta has built out a network of almost 1,000 stores, most of them 10,000 square feet in size, almost as big as aStaples Inc.(NASDAQ:SPLS) office supply store.

But that's a hair of a miss, and something that excellent operational results - and a $25 million share repurchase program announcement - should've overcome.Instead, the reason might be found in a trader's bearish call from Monday, indicating that while Ulta is an impressive growth story,fair value could be as much as 40% below the current price.

That's worth a loss of nearly 15% since TSLA stock peaked in the middle of February.makeArticleAd();The catalyst? Sentiment has soured on concerns aboutvery lofty market expectations for the launch of the Model 3 sedanlater this year.The Bears Are Circling TSLA StockThe selling intensified in late February after Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino cut TSLA stock to ""Sell"" and lowered his price target to $185 - which would be worth another 25% drop from current levels.While acknowledging the company's leadership role relative to more established automakers in terms of electric vehicle technology, EV adoption with customers and battery manufacturing, his concerns focused on near-term operational execution of the Model 3 launch, the unproven solar business and the rapid free cash burn rate (which is expected to necessitate a capital rate before the fourth quarter of the year).The capital expenditure needs to get the Model 3 produced - and ramp production of the existing Model S and Model X as expected - is large totaling $3 billion in Tamberrino's estimate.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017In his note on TSLA stock, he also identifies and charts the ""Tesla hype cycle,"" shown below, as showing how shares have been rangebound between $180 and $280 over the last few years, with the ups and downs associated with hype surrounding new products followed by lamentation on delays, lowered delivery targets and capital raises.The delivery expectations on Wall Street are simply untenable. The company delivered 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 76,230 for 2016, missing expectations. Yet the Street expects Tesla, somehow, to deliver 1,000,000 vehicles per year by 2020 despite a still burgeoning EV charging network, reports ofhedge funds stockpiling battery materialsand the fact TSLA hasn't even completed a beta prototype of the Model 3.The company will next report results on May 3 after the bell.

Residential Solar Revolution: Why National Installers Aren't Evolving Fast Enough;3/9/2017;"Just over two years ago, nearly three-quarters of residential   solar companies used third-party financing in the form of leases   or power purchase agreements to finance their solar systems. Now,   according toGTM Research, that number fell to just 47% last quarter and the decline shows   no sign of slowing down.This has caused an upheaval for installers built on the   leasing model, whether they'll admit it or not. SolarCity was in   trouble untilTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought it out, andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) haven't been able to turn their leasing businesses   into sustainably profitable businesses, either. With the   financing trends changing, these companies need to find a new   direction forward.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Changing gears in residential solarI don't think the transition from selling solar systems with   leases to selling them with loans can be done over time because   the companies I mentioned have too much financial incentive to   sell leases rather than loans. Tesla is trying to make the   transition, but its installations are declining, and it was still   only 28% sales and 72% leases last quarter.Instead, national installers need to rip off the Band-Aid:   Ditch the lease and replace it with a loan product that will be   easy for customers to understand. This will bring in cash   immediately and reduce confusion for customers.Another step they can take to transition their businesses and   generate cash is selling the portfolio of leased assets they have   sitting on the balance sheet. There are a number of yieldcos that   would love to own those residential solar assets at the right   price. And even if the price isn't perfect, installers should   want to sell their financing assets to focus on lowering   installation costs.The third transition all solar companies need to make is think   about differentiation. Financing was a differentiator a few years   ago, but if cash or loan sales are the dominant financing model,   what separates Vivint from Sunrun, or anyone else at this   point?Tesla is making the case that it's different with an upcoming   solar panel, the Powerwall, and the solar roof that's supposed to   launch this summer. If these products are successful, they will   create a path to the future.Sunrun and Vivint Solar have tested some new products like   energy storage, but they need to double down on the next   generation. Vivint may be well served integrating more fully with   its sister company's security solutions. Sunrun would be wise to   partner with a high-efficiency solar panel manufacturer and an   energy storage company to differentiate itself.Financial results are starting to dragWith the market moving away from the national installer model,   financials are starting to look worse for these installers. Tesla   said it installed just 803 MW of solar in 2016, down from an   original guidance of 1.25 GW. Vivint Solar's third quarter (the   most recent reported) saw installations fall from 61 MW a year   ago to 59 MW as it focused on leases. And while Sunrun is growing   more than the other two and has added cash and loan products, it   has the highest costs of the three, which should lead to lower   margins overall. It also has a clear incentive to push customers   toward the more profitable lease.Industry data shows that the solar lease is dying, and solar   installers need to adapt. I think that will require a paradigm   shift in how they think about their business, or they'll get run   over by competitors who adapt more quickly.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Unveils Major Solar Project on Kauai Island, Hawaii;3/9/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAlaunched a solar project in Hawaii, in association with Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (""KIUC""). Tesla will provide Hawaiian island of Kauai with solar power, using its panels and giant battery packs at the farm.makeArticleAd();The solar farm comprises 54,978 solar panels, which have 13 megawatts of solar generation capacity as well as 272 52-megawatt-hour Tesla Powerpack lithium-ion battery storage systems. Tesla has installed these batteries in order to store the solar energy which can be used during night.Under the terms of the collaboration, KIUC will purchase power for a period of 20 years at the rate of 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cost is lower than that incurred to purchase power from diesel plants as well as below the charge paid by consumers for electricity in the state.Recently, KIUC has also signed a contract with a subsidiary of Virginia-based AES Corp. Under the deal, the entities will develop a solar-plus-battery storage project on the island's South Shore. It will include a 28-megawatt solar farm and a 20-megawatt five-hour duration energy storage system.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Jekyll-and-Hyde Trade Right Now;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) are higher by a solid 20% year-to-date, and AAPL stock is up 40% over the past 12 months. Making ""bets"" on a stock based on its recent percentage moves doesn't make much sense, though, in a raging risk-on environment such as we've seen since last November.makeArticleAd();Over my career, I have found that applying a multi-time-frame approach to stock trading and investing not only allows for better perspective, but as a result, also results in superior risk management - and dare I say ""timing"" of trade entries and exits.I make it a point in this column to often remind ye faithful that stocks are a highly correlated asset class, particularly compared to other asset classes such as commodities. While the price of pork bellies has little correlation with the price of gold, within the stock market, around 80% of stocks tend to rise and fall together at any given time. I point this out because while the year-to-date rally in AAPL stock is impressive and worth respecting until it reverses, there also has been a broader stock market risk-on trade thus far in 2017.More than anything, I highlight this for perspective.When I last discussed Apple stock onFeb. 2following the latest earnings report, I said that shares were reaching a critical technical area of resistance through a multimonth lens. While AAPL has since marginally pushed above this technical area, the tale of two time frames remains.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowToday, I would like to reiterate and update this analysis.AAPL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that Apple over the years has greatly respected its 200-week simple moving average (red), which was a source of technical support in 2013 and again just last year.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, we also see that each time AAPL stock gets overly extended above this moving average, it tends to fall into a consolidation phase. Currently, the stock trades roughly 30% above this moving average; at past extremes, Apple traded as much as 50% above it.From this perspective, AAPL stock could have further to run on the upside.On the other hand, the MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart has now reached levels that in the past led to some downside pressure.Lastly - and I believe most importantly - the rate of change (i.e., the near-vertical rally over the past couple months) has pushed AAPL stock back above its 2015 highs. While this in and of itself is a positive development, previous important highs rarely if ever are overcome on a sustainable basis until and unless some consolidation near those previous highs has taken place.Apple stock has yet to consolidate. Thus, it likely will find the current upside momentum unsustainable over the next few weeks or even months.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?On the daily chart, we see that AAPL gapped higher again following its Jan. 31 earnings report, and despite already being overbought by plenty of measures, kept pushing higher as the broader stock market animal spirits brought in fresh momentum.Click to EnlargeNote that except for a couple days in early January, AAPL stock has now held above its 8-day simple moving average (blue) since early December 2016. That is alongstretch to be trading above such a near-term moving average. I feel it increasingly begs for some consolidation lower.At the same time, until this moving average is broken on the downside, one must continue to respect the uptrend.Through this near-term lens, if AAPL can close above $140, a next squeeze higher into $143 - $144 looks plausible. Alternatively, a break and hold below $138.50 could set in motion a better consolidation move lower with first downside targets near $136 and $132.Like what you see?

Is Realty Income Corp (O) the Best REIT Right Now?;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRealty Income Corp(NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It is one of the leading REITs in the retail sector and is one of the most consistent total-return REITs in the business.makeArticleAd();The question is whether retail REITs are the best place to be right now. With the growth of online shopping and the challenges many big box retailers are experiencing, buying a stock in a firm that owns the property and buildings in the sector where a massive long-term disruption is taking place may not be the best choice.But that isn't O.O specializes in stand-alone retail spaces. For example, its biggest tenant isWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NYSE:WBA). Its second largest client isFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Other major tenants includeCVS Health Corp(NYSE:CVS),Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) andDollar General Inc(NYSE:DG), to name a few.O's biggest competitor isSimon Property Group Inc(NYSE:SPG), which is almost 4x the size of O by market cap.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The biggest difference between the two is that SPG focuses on shopping malls, where O focuses on stand-alone businesses.That means O is in much better shape with its tenants than SPG is. Realty Income Corp has tenants that are not as challenged by online competition. And, since its tenants don't rely on other tenants on the property, it's much clearer the kind of revenue stream they need to make it profitable.SPG is at the whim of consumers and tenants alike. For example, it's not unusual for smaller malls to have both aSears Holding Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) and aJ C Penney Company Inc(NYSE:JCP) anchoring the rest of the mall. If the Sears leaves, you have a problem. If the JC Penney leaves as well, you have a disaster.This is the biggest challenge today. The mall concept is losing steam. The stores that are locked into leases for space in these malls will either walk away, close up shop or request a rent adjustment given the new circumstances.Whatever option you choose, it is bad news for SPG.But O is freed from all that bother. Its tenants are growing, not contracting. They operate their own businesses and their models have been proven from small towns to big cities.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Continues to Ignore the Elephant in the RoomThis is the significant difference between it and others in the retail space.Its dividend is a solid 4.3% and O stock is focused on maintaining it and raising it. The stock has been treading water for the past 12 months, but its numbers continue to impress. Some analysts are concerned that its valuation is too high, but given the fact that it operates one of the best REIT portfolios out there, it should be higher than say, SPG and others.Now is a great time to pick this REIT up at a good price.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Why It's So Important for Tesla to Shift to Solar Sales as Quickly as Possible;3/8/2017;"One of the most prominent criticisms of SolarCity prior to   being acquired byTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was that the solar installer had a cash flow   problem.This situation was created by the fact that SolarCity rose to   become the No. 1 installer largely through its leasing model,   which offered customers solar power at little to no upfront cost.   But that required the company to invest its own money upfront   into systems that it would subsequently monetize through lease   payments and power purchase agreements (PPAs) over the course of   decades.By its own admission, SolarCity focused too heavily on growing   its MW deployments, which is why it reduced its deployment   guidance several times in 2016 in order to better manage cash   flow. Additionally, it was on SolarCity, as the owner of the   systems, to monetize the Solar Investment Tax Credit (worth 30%   of the value of the system), which it did (and still does)   through a convoluted system of tax equity financing.

Image source: Tesla.In contrast, a cash sale pulls forward the revenue recognition   and the cash flow with it, while leaving it to the customer to   realize the value from the tax credit. It's a much simpler model   in almost every way, although the sales process is more involved.   That's why it's so important for Tesla to shift to solar sales   instead of leases as quickly as possible. Fortunately, Tesla is   making progress.The proportion of sales is risingIn Tesla's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, the company   notes ongoing progress with the shift toward cash sales.MetricQ4 2015Q3 2016Q4 2016Percentage of solar capacity deployed that are           sales4%13%28%Data source: SEC filings.Tesla deployed 201 MW of solar energy generation and 98 MWh of   energy storage during the quarter, and the company makes it   abundantly clear that ""cash preservation"" is far more important   than MW deployment growth at this stage. Just today, Tesla   announced that it had completed a large deployment in Hawaii for   a 13 MW generation system combined with 52 MWh of storage,   consisting of nearly 55,000 panels and over 270 Powerpacks.Video source: Tesla.Give it timeCEO Elon Musk reiterated on the subsequent earnings call that   the energy storage market is set to take off and will likely grow   at a faster rate -- perhaps twice the rate, by Musk's estimation   -- than the automotive business. The energy business posted a   sharp uptick in sales, jumping sequentially from $23.3 million in   the third quarter to $131.4 million in the fourth quarter, but   this was driven by the SolarCity deal closing with about six   weeks left in the quarter.Margins in the energy business were held back by ongoing   investments in production capacity, but Tesla says it expects   long-term gross margin to be comparable to the automotive   business, which is to say a long-term target of 25% to 30%   (automotive gross margin was 22% last quarter).It might take a while to revamp the sales and distribution   model, but continuing to emphasize sales instead of leases, as   well as cash flow, is absolutely the right call.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Stock Without Fear;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe biotech and healthcare sectors were the political punching bags of the 2016 U.S. elections. And now, President Trump's rhetoric of lower drug prices continues the turmoil in pharmaceutical stocks. As a result, theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) has had a violent year.makeArticleAd();Source:A 4 via FlickrUp until yesterday, the sector was in a recovery. Then renewed promises of new systems for lower drug prices caused another tizzy. Stocks likeBristol-Myers Squibb Co(NYSE:BMY) suffered with the herd. Today's price action, however, is encouraging, as investors bid BMY higher.Late January, I shared how togo long BMY on a panic dip. The trade was an easy success. Today I plan on repeating performance with a similar concept.The fundamentals have not changed, so I won't spend time re-dissecting them. There may be concessions to be made, but considering the size and influence of the biotech sector, I bet that they will be much milder than the built-in fears of Wall Street.How to Trade BMY StockThe Bet:Sell the BMY Jan 2018 $43 puts and collect $1.30 per contract to open. The 23% buffer from current price allows for a 90% theoretical chance of success. I need BMY stock to stay above my sold put, though. If not, I will be need to buy BMY shares. So I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock. Anything below $42 would accrue losses for me. For those who don't want to risk being put BMY stock I can change the trade to be a credit put spread instead.3 Biotech Stocks That Could Double OvernightThe Alternate:Sell a BMY Jan 2018 $43/$40 credit put spread for $1.01. Unlike the naked put sold, the credit spread has a finite risk profile. The price buffer is the same, so this has a 90% chance for yielding 33% on money risked. I need Bristol-Myers to stay above my sold spread while the trade is open.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close them for partial gains or losses at any time.

Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) With Help;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith one mostly successful launch byAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) under its belt, AMD stock looks to be at a nice launching point of its own. And for bullish investors believing in second chances both off and on the price chart, a modified options spread is looking like a smart choice.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLet me explain.Depending on one's tech-savvy or who you turn to who can break down the bits and bytes, Advanced Micro's debut of Ryzen, its new CPU for PCs and servers, may have you on the fence. Since its release last week some are saying AMD isback in the game, with the right blend of disruptive architecture and price. Many techies, though, are giving Ryzenmixed reviews.The consensus appears to agree that if you're looking for Ryzen to take your breath away for its desktop gaming capabilities - keep looking, or at least give AMD time to improve the functionality. But if it's workstation performance you're craving right here and right now, Ryzen delivers.In other circles of (some) importance, foreign-based investorMubadala Developmenthas taken an age-old cue from Wall Street and sold into the news. From a SEC filing, it was learned the firm, a long-term holder of the company, unloaded about $615 million of AMD stock. That's roughly one-third of its position.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Maybe more important is the still massive 97 million share stake owned by Mubadala. In speaking with Reuters the firm stated, more or less, that it was simplytime to ring the registeron part of their holdings. And as with someuniform but overall modestinsider selling of AMD stock by key personnel, I personally can't fault those parties for taking profits.AMD Stock Daily ChartPullbacks or corrective moves are not very much fun when you're already long a stock. But the double-digit decline experienced over the past week in AMD is common enough in growth stocks that it's not worth getting overly alarmed over.Furthermore, when the price action shapes up as a constructive-looking bottom, the situation offers investors an attractive entry point with risk-to-reward skewed in their favor.Specifically, AMD stock has established a high-level double-bottom pattern off the prior highs set back in December. The price formation was confirmed Tuesday with a modest signal through the high of the prior session's doji candlestick.As well, with the 50-day simple moving average also offering support just below Monday's pivot low of $12.38 and AMD shares signaling an oversold stochastics condition - investors have a fairly nice technical point of entry and a couple options for exiting if the corrective bottom fails.AMD Stock Modified CollarBeing optimistic that a bottom is in and with earnings out of the way, as well as one of AMD's big product catalysts, I like a modified collar in AMD stock as a way to position long. In this spread, the trader buys shares, sells an out-of-the-money call and purchases partial protection using a bear put vertical.With the modified collar, risk isn't fully closed off. The vertical only offers intrinsic protective value equal to the width and placement of the strikes used. Further, the hedge value is typically less effective when the expiration is far off and/or using a narrow spread.The benefit of using the vertical is the reduced cost compared to an outright long put for protection. But given its limitations, this variation is more attractive when company-specific news isn't on the calendar.Having said that and with AMD stock at $13.23, selling the April $16 call and buying the April $12/$10 put spread in conjunction with purchasing shares is priced for $13.33, or 10 cents more than the cost of the standalone stock position.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Continues to Ignore the Elephant in the RoomOutside the discussed limitations, on an expiration basis this contains risk to $1.33, at which time the $12 put offers protection for the AMD stock component. Of course, there would be additional losses below $10. However, that's nearly 25% below current prices and given what's been discussed, this strategist sees the positioning as an acceptable trade-off.The real cost to this AMD position is thought to be the sold $16 call used to finance the protective value of the vertical. At the end of the day and prior to any adjustments, the sale does cap the trader's upside potential. Bottom line though, given that's nearly 21% higher, we're personally very receptive to that type of less-pressing challenge.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

How Tesla Created an Opportunity for Bentley Motors to go Electric;3/8/2017;"British hyper-luxury brand Bentley Motors brought a surprise   to the Geneva Motor Show this week: an electric car.For now, the Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept, as it's called,   is strictly for show. But it's a show car with a mission: To help   Bentley decide if it's time to grab an opportunity it sees for an   electric luxury car positioned above the products fromTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .The Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept could point the way to     the British super-luxury brand's first battery-electric     vehicle. Image source: Bentley Motors.makeArticleAd();What it is: A Bentley, only electricThe EXP 12 Speed 6e is a high-performance convertible with the   craftsmanship and interior details that are typical of Bentley   (that is to say, exquisite). It has the usual high-tech touches,   but done Bentley's way: The interior is swathed in   fine leather, wood, and hand-cut glass.Leather, wood, glass, and over-the-top details? The EXP 12     Speed 6e is definitely a Bentley. Image source: Bentley     Motors.Bentley said that a production version would have rapid   inductive charging and ""a range sufficient for grand touring   requirements."" But didn't give details of the car's powertrain or   specifics on its battery or range, because this isn't intended to   be a production car.Instead, as Bentley CEO Wolfgang Durheimer explained, this   Bentley is intended to be a starting point for conversations with   potential customers:The EXP 12 Speed 6e is a concept to show that Bentley is     defining electric motoring in the luxury sector, with the     appropriate technology, high quality materials and refinement     levels you'd expect from a true Bentley. This concept enables     us to engage with luxury customers and gather feedback on our     approach.Bentley is committed to offering an electric model in its     future portfolio and we are interested to receive feedback on     this concept.In an interview at the Geneva Motor Show, Durheimer toldBloombergthat part of the idea is to find out if it's time for Bentley to   develop an electric model -- or if its customers will continue to   be happy with combustion engines and hybrids for the time being.   (Bentley will roll out its first plug-in hybrid next year.) If   the electric concept is well-received, Bentley could have an   electric model on the market by 2021, he said.But whether it turns out to be the right time or not, an   electric Bentley is coming, thanks to an opportunity created by   Tesla.Why Tesla's success creates an opening for an electric   BentleyBentley, like other super-luxury brands, is eyeing the market   segment above vehicles like Tesla's Model S and Model X. Those   Teslas are broadly competitive with the upper-tier models from   luxury brands likeBMWand Mercedes-Benz in terms of performance and features (and   price). But there's space for something even more luxurious.Brands like Bentley, and its British competitors Rolls-Royce   and Aston Martin, have for many years found a small but   profitable market in luxury cars that are a step up from the   likes of BMW and Mercedes. Now, they seean opportunity to build carsfor well-heeled, electric-car enthusiasts who might be happy   Tesla owners today, but might also be interested in an   opportunity to move up to something more deluxe, more   personalized.Bentley's typical attention to hand-crafted detail is far     from ordinary, even by Tesla or BMW standards. Image source:     Bentley Motors.To credibly appeal to Tesla owners, Bentley will have to   incorporate high-quality technology into its eventual electric   car. That shouldn't be a problem: Bentley Motors is owned by   giantVolkswagen AG(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , and will presumably take advantage of the   battery-electric technology being developed for its sibling   brands, Audi and Porsche.That technology is thought to be quite advanced: Audi plans to   launch a battery-electric SUV aimed directly at Tesla's Model Xearly next year. An electric Porsche sports sedan is expected to followabout a year later.It may or may not exactly match Tesla's technology. But it   should be close enough to satisfy customers drawn to Bentley's   other attributes -- customers that will be interested in an   electric Bentley largely because of Tesla's success.Another view of the Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept. Image     source: Bentley Motors.So will Bentley go electric?I think it's likely that Bentley will go electric. The total   world market for such a Bentley might only be a few thousand   models a year, at most -- at least at first. But this is a brand   that sold a grand total 11,023 cars worldwide last year. Given   that an electric Bentley would be using technology sourced from   its corporate parent, it doesn't seem like it would have to sell   in huge numbers to turn a profit.With Europe and China moving more aggressively toward electric   vehicles, and all of those Tesla customers in the United States,   it seems likely that a well-done Bentley with a competitive   battery-electric drivetrain would find enough customers to make   the effort worthwhile. We'll likely find out in another year or   so.10 stocks we like better than Volkswagen AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN) Q4 Earnings Raise Some Red Flags;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeading into theUrban Outfitters, Inc.(NASDAQ:URBN) fourth-quarter earnings report, there were two areas of focus for investors. Urban Outfitters already released Q4 sales figures in early February. Flat comparable-store sales for the period were below expectations, but URBN stock still gained modestly on the news. As such, trailing revenue wasn't likely to be a major point of emphasis in the Urban Outfitters earnings report.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Rather, the focus was on margins, and on fiscal 2018 (ending January) guidance. And on both fronts, expectations were low. MKM Partners downgraded URBN stock on Feb. 27, specifically citing margin pressure at Anthropologie. Wunderlich cut its price target for URBN to $26 on Monday, projecting compressed margins from higher online sales. Goldman Sachs already had cut Urban Outfitters stock to ""Sell"" in early February, on concerns of overall retail weakness going forward.Urban Outfitters earnings for Q4 appear to support those concerns - even though shares have risen modestly in after-hours trading.The same pressures dogging the entire retail sector appear to have made their way to Urban Outfitters. That's not pushing URBN stock lower in Tuesday after-market trading, but it could in the weeks ahead.Urban Outfitters Earnings Show Margin PressureMany retailers have responded to the endless omnichannel threat driven byAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) by building out e-commerce businesses of their own. But until recently, investors hadn't quite understood the inherent problem with that strategy: It hurts profit margins.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAdding an e-commerce supply chain and other capabilities on top of an existing brick-and-mortar footprint simply adds more cost. And to compete with online-only rivals, retailers must cut price as well.Urban Outfitters specifically cited that problem in its Q4 release. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was down 142 bps year-over-year. The issue, per URBN, was ""primarily"" delivery and supply chain costs. Those costs were elevated by increasing DTC (direct to consumer sales). For the quarter, flat comparables were driven by a double-digit increase in DTC revenue - offset by declining sales in-store.The formula of ~flat revenue and increasing e-commerce share implies margin and profit pressure - and that's exactly what happened to Urban Outfitters earnings. Net income declined 12% year-over-year in Q4, with EPS missing analyst estimates by a penny. And declining profits won't support URBN stock, which still trades at nearly 14x EPS at after-hour prices. (To be fair, the multiple is closer to 12x including the company's ~$3 per share in cash and securities.)Sales and Profit Growth Questions Remain For URBN StockThe problem coming out of the fourth-quarter release is that those margin pressures aren't likely to abate. In fact, CEO Richard Hayne said in the Q4 release that Urban Outfitters wouldincreaseits focus on DTC sales. Store occupancy costs were flat as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. But further revenue weakness in store could add deleverage on that line as well - and further pressure Urban Outfitters earnings.From a sales standpoint, there wasn't much new information in the release, though the post-earnings conference should give more color. It does appear that the Urban Outfitters brand, which accounted for 40% of FY17 sales, is reasonably well-positioned. That brand did have higher markdowns in Q4 - but lower discounting on a full-year basis.The other 60% or so of the retail base, however, may have some concerns.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Anthropologie sales declined in Q4, as mentioned, even with higher markdowns. And Free People saw lower gross margin in FY17 - again, due to higher markdowns.URBN Stock Isn't That CheapAll told, there's enough in the Urban Outfitters earnings release to suggest some potential problems for URBN stock in 2017.It's not as if Urban Outfitters is all that cheap, either. A 12x-plus cash multiple mightsoundinexpensive, but it's in line with most of the retail space.Gap Inc(NYSE:GPS) trades at similar levels, as doesAmerican Eagle Outfitters(NYSE:AEO). Both of those stocks are coming off decent years - in my opinion,betteryears than Urban Outfitters. AEO, in particular, given its ownership of Aerie, has a growth catalyst that URBN stock may not at the moment.Retail in general is an extremely tough space, to the point that some observers have called the sector simply ""uninvestable."" I tend to agree with that characterization. Those investors looking to enter the space need to chose only the best companies, with the least risk. Urban Outfitters is one of the better companies, but I'm not sure it's quite top-tier.And coming out of Q4, there are a lot of potential risks to both sales and margins in fiscal 2018.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Closed-End Funds That Have Big-Time YieldsIs Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The postUrban Outfitters, Inc.

Chevy Bolt U.S. Deliveries Decline in February;3/7/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) began deliveries of its all-new, fully electric   Chevrolet Bolt inDecember, and the $37,500 vehicle is a strong alternative toTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcoming $35,000 Model 3. As the first   affordably priced fully electric vehicle with over 200 miles of   range per charge (238 miles of EPA-rated range to be exact) to   hit the market, the vehicle is an important foundational step for   GM.But GM's acceleration into the long-range electric vehicle   market has not been smooth. Bolt sales in the U.S. pulled back   slightly in February compared to January. However, this doesn't   mean the new vehicle won't make a splash this year.Chevy Bolt. Image source: General MotorsmakeArticleAd();Bolt deliveriesThe trajectory of Bolt deliveries in 2017 so far isn't showing   the sharply rising curve that will be required if GM is to hit   the approximately 25,000 to 30,000 deliveries management is   reportedly targeting (perReuters) for the year. Bolt deliveries declined from 1,162 units in   January to 952 in February.In addition, the company's February sales release dropped its   January reference to the Bolt's fastest days-to-turn rate in the   industry --  a measure of how quickly a vehicle sells to a   customer after arriving on a dealer's lot. For January,   management boasted of a days-to-turn rate of just seven days for   the Bolt.Bolt. Image source: General MotorsIt's not clear how many vehicles GM expects to produce in   2017. In January 2016, GM manager of electrification technology   communications Kevin KellytoldHybridCars that the company would be able to fill orders for up   to 50,000 customers in 2017 if demand reached that level. But in   November 2016,Wall Street Journalauthor Adrienne Roberts paraphrased GM spokeswoman Michelle   Malcho assayingthe Bolt ""is expected to meet high interest, but will be offered   in limited quantities in 2017.""A national rollout is just getting startedAll of GM management's comments point to limited production   and availability of the Bolt during the first half of the year.   Indeed, in February's release, management noted that the   ""national rollout of the crossover is just under way."" Further,   when The Motley Fool asked Chevrolet electric vehicle   communications spokesman Fred Ligouri for a comment regarding the   Bolt's production, he provided this statement:We're ramping up production and delivering inventory to new     markets each month, including the addition of New York and New     Jersey in March. We have a number of units in transit and look     forward to welcoming new Bolt EV owners to the Chevy family in     the weeks and months to come.Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk is arguablybullish on the Bolt's potential. In November, the CEO said he thinks a car like the Bolt should   sell in volumes of hundreds of thousands of units per year. His   confidence likely stems from the nearly 400,000 deposit-backed   reservations he watched come in for Tesla's upcoming Model 3   shortly after its launch.Of course, GM hasn't indicated it's planning for Bolt   production anywhere near that level. But that doesn't mean it   won't be bringing a higher-volume electric vehicle to market   soon.GM is entirely familiar with the process of ramping up vehicle   production. If demand for the Bolt is high enough to solicit   30,000 deliveries during 2017, it could likely pull off the feat   of manufacturing that many in the second half of the year alone.   So that will be the period investors interested in the electric   vehicle space will want to watch closely. As the Bolt becomes   more widely available in markets across the U.S., production and   deliveries will likely soar.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Wins When Everyone Stays Home;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat do the pizza and big-box retail industries have to do withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and the performance of NFLX stock going forward?makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSurprisingly, a lot.Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) recently got a boost from better-than-expected quarterly results. Meanwhile,Target Corporation(NYSE:TGT) is in a slump after disappointing Q4 earnings. DPZ is up more than 70% since the start of 2016, while TGT is down 20%. As weird as it may seem, the simple parallel between Domino's recent success and Target's recent failures underscores a secular shift in the consumer economy which strongly favors NFLX stock.CNBC's Jim Cramer is calling it the ""stay-at-home economy,"" and it's showing up in everyone's earnings reports. Companies - such as Domino's and Netflix - that cater to this mentality are thriving; those that don't are struggling.Netflix stock hasn't been the only big winner from this shift. Delivery-centric quick service food stocks like DPZ andPapa John's Int'l, Inc.(NASDAQ:PZZA) are up big since the start of 2016. More traditional quick-service food stocks that don't focus on delivery, likeMcDonald's Coproration(NYSE:MCD), have struggled recently.Non-store retailers and online marketplaces such asAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN) andEtsy Inc.(NASDAQ:ETSY) have surged. Meanwhile, traditional retailers likeWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) andMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) are rapidly changing their business models to stay relevant.In a nutshell, though, that is the problem with staying long the stocks that have been early winners of the ""stay-at-home"" shift. Everyone is catching on, and most are catching up.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksIn the food industry, services likePostmatesare gaining popularity, and that is democratizing food delivery. In retail, all mall retailers are focused on building out an omnichannel presence, and free shipping is becoming more of a regular. Competition for services in the ""stay-at-home"" economy will only intensify.With one exception: Netflix.Why Netflix Is DifferentIn many ways, Netflix pioneered the stay-at-home economy. In 2011, the company split its DVD rental and streaming services. Consumers weren't pleased, and about800,000 membersquit Netflix.The dissatisfaction was short-lived, though, as consumers began to realize they could access a robust entertainment library from their couch for an affordable monthly fee. Over the next several years, Netflix dramatically grew its user base, NFLX stock soared, cord-cutting became the thing to do, and everyone started moving to over-the-top content.As everyone moved to OTT, Netflix's competition began to stiffen. Investors began to question the company's competitive moat. Netflix's response was to spend big on original content. That big spend, though, weighed on earnings. With competition up and earnings down, Netflix stock flat-lined for most of 2016.Until the Q3 report.The original content slate ofStrangerThings,Narcosand Marvel'sLukeCageduring the summer of 2016 drove exceptional sub growth. The Q4 report showed just as much promise on the original content front.Today, Netflix has almost94 million membersand is growing with exceptional pace considering the scale of the business. In other words, even several years after its pivot to streaming and many new competitors later, Netflix remains the premiere service in the streaming video on demand marketplace.Bottom Line on NFLX StockYes, Netflix stock trades at an absurdly high trailing price-to-earnings multiple, but that multiple doesn't capture the extent of Netflix's value.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?The international growth story is just getting started. Original local content across the globe is bolstering international sub growth. That market is much larger than the domestic one. The early success of Netflix's original content continues to widen the company's moat. Higher quality original content allows for higher unit revenues (or ARPU). Higher unit revenues allow for higher margins. Overall, big sub growth plus higher unit revenues should lead to not only outsized revenue growth, but outsized earnings growth as well.Netflix made staying at home cool. The market for providing services in the ""stay-at-home"" economy is getting more and more crowded. Netflix, however, seems to be immune to this competition.Netflix remains the premiere service in a secular growth space, and Netflix stock remains a must-own in a hot market.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is About to ReboundShould I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe postNetflix, Inc.

Let's face it, the mightyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to wreak havoc on brick-and-mortar operators.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)But so far, Lowe's has been immune. Then again, when it comes to home improvement, consumers still like to make a visit to a big-box location.OK then, so what about Lowe's stock now? Is there still room on the upside? Well, I think so. For the most part, the momentum looks sustainable for LOW stock. And here are three reasons to keep in mind:Reason No. 1 for Lowe's Stock: Positive Macro EnvironmentAgain, the latest quarterly report shows that the company is on a nice growth path. Note that revenues jumped19% to $15.78 billionand comparable sales rose by 5.1%. By comparison, the Street consensus was looking for revenues of $15.39 billion and comparable store sales of only 2.4%A key to the strength is the positive fundamentals for the home improvement industry. After all, there has been a steady increase in real estate prices, which has encouraged more spending.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchAccording toLowe's CEO Robert Niblock: ""Expected growth in the home improvement market is further support of the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that post election, homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the national economy and their personal financial situations and we believe this trend will continue, as almost half of the homeowners we surveyed indicate that they are very likely to begin a home improvement project in the next six months, and more than half of homeowners believe that home values are rising and will continue to increase.""Reason No. 2 for LOW Stock: Omnichannel SuccessIn the retail world, the concept of ""omnichannel"" is a common buzzword. It's essentially about providing customers with consistent experiences across in-store and digital platforms.Of course, LOW stock has been pursuing this strategy for some time, such as with a revamped website and improved mobile apps. Oh, and there have even been cutting-edge innovations with VR (Virtual Reality) and robots, which help answer questions in Lowe's locations.And the investments are really starting to pay off. During the latest quarter, the comp growth for Lowes.com jumped by 25%. Interestingly enough, digital traffic is growing at 15 times the store traffic since 2010 and mobile accounts for a quarter of overall traffic.LOW stock has also been skillful with leveraging online channels for marketing and branding campaigns. For example, the company's Pinterest page has over 3.4 million users. What's more, Lowe's has been active in creating engaging videos for platforms likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) FireTV andRoku.Yet the omnichannel strategy has not just been about technology. Just look at the rollout of the interior project specialist program.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?This involves highly trained employees who help customers to plan, design and complete home improvement projects.Reason No. 3 for Lowe's Stock: Shareholder ValueDuring the fiscal year, the companyrepurchased $3.5 billionof Lowe's stock. And yes, the board recently authorized a new program for up to$5 billion in buybacks.As for the valuation on Lowe's stock, it is fairly reasonable. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 15X. By comparison,Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) trades at a multiple of 18X.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Is Just Giving Away Money;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn November, I shared how to generate free profits being longBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU). But this time, the earnings lotto wasn't too lucky. The breakout in BIDU stock fizzled as traders sold on the news.makeArticleAd();Source:Simone.Brunozzi Via FlickrFundamentally nothing has changed for the company. Baidu still is a solid bet for the long-term. The setback was from pure price action and not based on any obvious execution or operational issues. So as long as markets in general don't correct, BIDU stock should find footing soon and remount another rally.Even though I have good reason to go long the stock, though, I am not about to risk $173 per share on this hard line. Today, I will set a trade using the options markets that gets me long Baidu stock for free and with room for error.How to Trade BIDU StockThe bet:Sell the BIDU Sep $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $2.5 per contract to open. I need Baidu shares to stay above my sold strike to win. The 24% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success.Click to EnlargeI only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at my strike price. Otherwise, I could turn this trade into a credit put spread. Yes, I would be limiting my potential profits, but I would also gain an advantage. The risk of a credit put spread is finite. When selling naked puts, I suffer losses below my breakeven point all the way down to zero.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!The Alternate:Sell the BIDU Sep $140/$135 Credit put spread. I collect 95 cents per contract to open. The buffer is slightly smaller here, but I still can yield 20% on risk with 90% theoretical certainty.Usually I like to hedge my bet and sell upside risk for balance. But in this case, I will delay this action. I don't leave myself open to a short position going bad on me if BIDU bounces. Since I am using longer-dated contracts, I am comfortable that I will be able to manage the short term price gyrations.The Juice (Optional):I could make my bet even more bullishly biased by adding a debit call spread. I also will delay this action until I see clear evidence of the bounce. Then I would buy the BIDU Apr debit call spread at the money. I pay half of the width of the spread for the chance of doubling my money.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Repairing My Tesla Model S Has Been an Utter Nightmare -- and It's Mostly Tesla's Fault;3/7/2017;"Seven months, three weeks, and three days.That's how long it's been since myTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S was involved in an accident and Istilldon't have my car back. That's nearly eight months of rather   large monthly payments for a car that I'm unable to drive; nearly   eight months of incrementally higher costs associated with   insurance and registration for a car that's sitting in the shop;   nearly eight months of having to find and arrange alternative   transportation; nearly eight months of having to buy gas again,   while the gas savings had previously offset part of said large   monthly payments; nearly eight months of impatiently waiting to   get back a car that I absolutely love; nearly eight months of   regularly prodding Tesla for updates with little to no   success.My Model S, shortly before the accident. Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();You may assume that my car was involved in some sort of   catastrophic incident that required a protracted period of time   to repair. Nope. It was a run-of-the-mill accident (more details   later). Tesla is predominantly responsible for why it is taking   so long, because out of those eight months, over five of them   were spent doing nothing but waiting for parts.Let me back up a bit and start from the beginning.Jan. 27, 2016: Delivery dayIn late 2015, my wife and I decided to take the plunge and buy   a Model S. We had been longtime supporters and investors in the   company, firstbuying shares in 2011. We finally pulled the trigger in December of that year. In   order to save quite a bit of money, we opted for a certified   pre-owned (CPO) model, which cost about a third less than a   comparably equipped new Model S would have cost at the time.At the time, the Colorado state tax credit ($6,000) for   electric vehicles could be claimed on used vehicles provided that   the car has never been registered in the state. (The state credit   was recently amended to exclude used vehicles, effective starting   2017.) So we found one that was located in New Jersey, and even   after paying the maximum transportation fee ($1,500), it still   easily worked out in our favor. It was less than 2 years old and   had less than 20,000 miles on it; not bad for what we saved by   going CPO. It was even the exact same shade of dark green as my   first car, a color option that had since been discontinued --   bonus nostalgia points.Delivery day at the Tesla service center. Image source:     Author.It took about a month for the car to arrive, but we   immediately fell in love with it. We started taking road trips   more often (within the bounds of the Supercharger network, of   course), and frequently found excuses just to drive and enjoy the   instant torque.Like most Tesla customers, we became involuntary but not   unwilling advocates for the company, fielding a constant string   of questions from friends, family, and strangers regarding how   the car worked as well as about the necessary behavioral   adjustments associated with going all-electric. We also attracted   the typical confounded stares when we'd put something in the   frunk, or put the kids in the rear-facing seats that we had Tesla   retrofit post-delivery.A couple months after taking delivery, we placed a reservation   for a Model 3 on March 31, the day that Tesla unveiled the   vehicle and started taking deposits.July 11, 2016: Accident dayI was actually at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California,   when the accident occurred (I worked for Tesla very briefly   during the summer of 2016). My wife called me frantically,   exasperated that she had been involved in an accident. Most   importantly, she was largely unharmed; just some minor whiplash   that she quickly recovered from. She was more concerned that the   car had been injured. She had been driving home from work,   sitting stationary at a stop light, when a young driver failed to   hit the brakes in time and rear-ended the vehicle at a relatively   low speed.Here's the picture I asked her to take of the car immediately   after the impact:Immediately after the accident. Image source: Author.It looks worse than it was, in part because the Model S and   Model X contain more aluminum than most vehicles. Aluminum   crumples much easier than steel since it's a softer metal. This   is also an important safety feature since the crumple zones are   both larger and able to absorb more impact, with the downside   being that aluminum is more expensive. A consequence is that   Tesla accidents look really bad because the vehicles get mangled,   but the functional benefit is minimal intrusion into the   passenger cabin.Less than six months after we had taken delivery, our Model S   was off to the shop.Nearly eight months later...While Tesla performs most routine service itself, it   outsources major body work to a network of third-party body shops   that are certified by Tesla. The certification process is   expensive and time-consuming, but certified body shops will   garner most of the local business (there is only one certified   body shop in my immediate area).Shortly after receiving my damaged car, the body shop started   tearing down the vehicle to assess the damage, and ordering the   parts that would be necessary for the repair. The vast majority   of the repair time has been gobbled up here. I had heard and read   stories about Tesla parts taking longer to deliver relative to   the rest of the industry, but that's somewhat expected for a   young car company with just one factory.Anecdotally, stories of it taking two to three months for Tesla to deliver   parts are not uncommon. After three months had passed and the   body shop had still not received all the necessary parts, we   began reaching out to Tesla directly through their customer   service channels, which serves as a liaison to the internal parts   department.At the body shop. Image source: Author.Initially, no customer service representative that we   interacted with was willing to take ownership of our issue. We   kept getting passed between representatives with little to no   useful information (a customer service manager eventually took   ownership of handling our issue after repeated escalations).   Parts had started to trickle in, but there still weren't enough   to start the repair so our car continued to sit idly. Two of the   more pertinent parts were a rear lift gate and rear quarter   panel, which were still outstanding. During one of the   escalations in November (four months after the accident),   Tesla guaranteed us that all parts would arrive at the body   shop no later than the last week of November. They didn't.In mid-December, the shopfinallyreceived enough (but not all) parts to start working on the car.   At that point, the holidays were nearly upon us, and every   industry slows down around that time of year. The body shop would   begin the repair in early January 2017 after the holidays. There   were still a few outstanding parts, including bulb rivets. I   would think that something as basic as rivets would be among the   easier parts to deliver, but evidently I'm wrong (and not alone). We again contacted customer service, and Tesla again assured   us they had just shipped the remaining parts for overnight   delivery. Frankly, we didn't have much faith at this point, as we   had been told this before. But in the final week of January, the   shop confirmed that they had indeed received all remaining parts   necessary to complete the repair. It looked like light at the end   of the tunnel, six months in. At this point in the story, the car   has spentmore time in the shop than in our possession.A couple weeks ago, the body shop updated us that the car was   about to enter the paint shop, at which point it should only be a   couple more weeks to reassemble the painted pieces and then   perform electronics calibrations and a few other outstanding   items. It turns out that the 12V battery is also now in need of   replacement, as it will no longer hold a charge (perhaps related   to how long the car has been sitting idle?). The shop ordered the   battery a week and a half ago. Tesla uses exactly one specific   supplier for its 12V batteries, which is struggling to keep up   with Tesla's demands. We're now looking at yet another delay for   the 12V battery, which is a part that most people are able to   purchase for their vehicles locally within 15 minutes.As soon as Tesla delivers this battery, the car will be ready   within a day or two. It's supposed to be ready this week, but at   this point I have incredibly low expectations, as we are again   waiting on Tesla to deliver.Look, Ma: No car!Tesla is known for having a generous loaner policy when   vehicles are being serviced, but sadly this policy does not apply   to body work.The driver that hit us was uninsured, so we had to file our   claims through our collision coverage, and we have coverage for a   rental. But our rental coverage maxes out at 45 days, which is   typically sufficient time for most body repairs. Having already   known that our repair would probably take at least two months, I   knew we would need to arrange alternative transportation. Even if   we opted to use our insurance company's negotiated rental rates,   it would cost approximately $1,000 per month to rent a car.   That'sin additionto the monthly loan payments that we are still paying.Fortunately, my parents are retired, and as such have little   need for their cars. My mother graciously agreed to let me borrow   her car as long as needed, which relieved us of having to bleed   out a small fortune ($7,000 by now) in rental fees for an   indefinite and still ongoing period of time.What this means for investorsTo say that this whole experience has been traumatizing would   be an understatement. As long-standing investors and   newfound customers, it has profoundly shaken our faith in Tesla   as a company. Thus far, Tesla has not given us a reason as towhyour parts were so severely delayed, so we have no indication as   to whether or not this is a one-off exception or if there is some   systemic problem within Tesla's parts operations. While we've   been waiting, Tesla has delivered tens of thousands of vehicles,   including about 29,000 Model S sedans.Some of Tesla's weakness here is certainly related to its own   ability to produce parts, which continues to improve every month.   Theoretically, parts production should improve as Tesla continues   to ramp its overall manufacturing capacity, but it seems like   this can't be the only reason. I'm mildly confident that my case   is an outlier, but even if it is, it's still disconcerting that   situations like this can slip through the cracks after repeated   escalations and assurances.It also calls into question Tesla's ability to support its   existing customer base, which is of critical relevance to whether   or not Tesla can support amassivelylarger customer base. The company is still targeting 500,000   units in 2018. As many analysts and pundits point out, the   mainstream is far less forgiving for this sort of thing compared   to enthusiastic early adopters.We are now questioning our Model 3 reservation. We haven't   finalized our decision, nor will we have to for a few more   months. Owning two Teslas now seems like a significant risk   should one of them ever be involved in any type of accident,   small or large. In sharing our story with other Model 3   reservation holders, we know that a few of them canceled as a   direct result, since our run-of-the-mill repair has devolved into   an utter nightmare.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos Wants to Dominate Outer Space;3/7/2017;"The Milky Way (Shutterstock Photo)Is there any place in the universe too big for Jeff Bezos to want to conquer?After crushing the world of retail, technology, shipping logistics, and a host of current projects poised to disrupt or create new markets, why wouldn’t Bezos think he could dominate outer space? The Amazon (AMZN) CEO, who currently ranks at the world's third-wealthiest person, has pioneered space launch company, Blue Origin, which is expected to reveal some customers and new initiatives this week.makeArticleAd();With what began as just an interesting idea, Bezos, a self-proclaimed ""space geek,” has already established tons of credibility for Blue Origin, which offers a family of reusable rockets powerful enough to penetrate deep into the solar system for suborbital voyages. Bezos envisions one day humans establishing a permanent settlement on the moon. It’s more than just a pipe dream. And given his Midas track record, Bezos’ space exploration plans should be taken seriously.The capabilities of Blue Origin, which has grown over the past year, can now blast both manned and robotic missions not only to the moon, but also to various planets. Flight safety tests are ongoing on the company’s New Shepard suborbital rocket, which Blue Origin built in-house and reportedly can take paying passengers into outer space some time next year.Blue Origin rivals the powerful rockets currently being touted by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX. While Musk appears to have a sizable lead on Bezos, given that SpaceX already has several rockets under development, Blue Origin has already caught the attention of NASA, which is already working on its own version of a deep-space booster and capsule,according toThe Wall Street Journal.What’s more, Bezos’ quick space advancements with Blue Origin has already won the distinguished Heinlein Prize for ""progress in commercial space activities that advances [the] dream of humanity's future in space."" Meanwhile, Aviation Week proclaimed Blue Origin its 60th Annual Space Laureate. And the fact that Bezos is willing to partner with NASA and bankroll space exploration underscores the will with which his interstellar ambitions run.Notably, the cost of Blue Origin and how it can be funded is one of several key differences with SpaceX. Bezos recently described ""the cost of admission ... is quite high.... So very few experiments get done."" Still, as the world’s third-richest person with almost $70B in net worth, Bezos can buy time to perfect Blue Origin. This race for outer space suggests that space is indeed the new frontier. Whether it’s the final frontier, as Star Trek claims? That remains to be seen."

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Gutted? Time to Go Long!;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company, yet Wall Street experts expected so much more out the GPRO story. They even once labeled it as ""a YouTube killer."" I betAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)Now, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.I think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.The hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.Click to EnlargeBased on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.The Bet:Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Yes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.Usually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)I could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.I am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) sold off hard following a fourth-quarter earnings report that fell short of the market's lofty expectations. Despite reporting better-than-expected revenue of $2.28 billion on the quarter, Tesla stock delivered an earnings loss much larger that the market anticipated.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs Tesla stock was already up more than 26% year-to-date headed into earnings, it's not surprising that the stock sold off.I've written many times about the dangers of investing in Tesla stock at its current market valuation.Tesla's 2017 run pushed the stock's market cap to around $45 billion, roughly in line with that ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). It's difficult to fathom such a high valuation for a company that shipped just 76,000 vehicles last year and burned through another $448 million in cash in Q4.The market may have higher hopes for Tesla stock than any other stock on the market. But long-term TSLA bulls don't care about Q4, or even 2017 for that matter. They aren't just investing in an auto company. They believe Tesla Inc. will change the world.The Tesla Stock Bull Case Is About QualityTesla stock bulls believe that it doesn't matter how many cars the company delivers in the short term. They feel the autonomous driving technology that CEO Elon Musk is developing will make Tesla vehicles the best in the world in the next decade.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has gotten a head-start on the long-range electric vehicle mass market. But TSLA appears to be on track to be the first to market with a fully-autonomous vehicle.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowLast year, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla had already driven222 million cumulative autopilot miles. Those miles are extremely important because the precious data they provide, which allows for fine-tuning the technology. By comparison,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo driverless car has logged only about2 million milesof data.If Tesla is the first to market with a driverless car, its data advantage will quickly compound exponentially. That huge advantage could make it very difficult for competitors to catch up.TSLA Stock Valuation Not an IssueThe scariest part about Tesla stock for most investors is its valuation. The stock already seems to have priced in tremendous long-term success.Compared to auto rivals Ford and GM, Tesla's valuation is bordering on absurd. Ford and GM, however, may not be Tesla's most appropriate peers. In fact, bulls might argue that TSLA stock is much more similar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Loup Ventures recently argued that Tesla stock today looksa lot like AMZN stockback in 2009. Both companies have been struggling to turn a profit. Both stocks have also already delivered huge gains in relatively short amounts of time.""Today, Amazon still struggles to make money, but shares have risen 10x over the past 8 years and are near all time highs,"" Loup writes. ""Amazon had the roadmap for the future of commerce and web services, similar to Tesla's roadmap to pursue the future of auto and solar, based on their core competencies in AI and robotics.""Tesla Controls Its Own DestinyAs long as the market keeps its appetite for growth, Tesla's projected 16%-22% CAGR in vehicle sales through 2025 could be plenty to keep the stock on an upward trajectory for the next decade. TSLA bulls need not even concern themselves with the electric vehicle fleets from GM or Ford. If Tesla can deliver the world's first and/or best driverless car, it is well on its way to securing a major long-term growth source.UBS Says Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Has 26% UpsideIn the meantime, Tesla stock will likely continue to defy value investors. If TSLA is the new AMZN, bulls can ignore earnings, debt, P/E ratio, competition and pretty much everything else about Tesla's business.

Why Utilities and Solar Companies May Be Finding Common Ground;3/6/2017;"As the solar industry becomes more competitive, both within   the industry and with fossil fuels, companies are having to   figure out where they most efficiently fit into the market. For a   while, solar companies thought they may have an advantage in   developing and owning solar projects, leading to the structure of   many of the companies you know today.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) all bought development companies to build large   projects, andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity was always a solar developer that   owned the systems it built. And all of these companies either   planned to own solar systems long term or drop them down to   yieldcos.As this was happening, utilities across the country began to   develop their own renewable energy strategies. The beginning was   buying renewable energy projects from developers, including the   solar companies mentioned above. But with more experience,   they've moved more and more into solar project development   themselves, cutting out the middleman.As the solar industry and utility industry begin to collide,   each has to figure out where they fit in the new world of energy.   And we may be seeing some hints about where the industry will   land in the long term.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Utilities learn their renewable energy roleAs utilities have entered the solar market, they've found that   that there are places where they hold an advantage over solar   companies. They may not ever manufacture solar panels or create a   great racking system, but they have a lower cost of capital than   solar companies. When the yieldco yields rose and made it   difficult for solar companies to drop downs assets to an entity   they controlled, utilities had an opening because they still had   a low cost of capital.What also makes sense is that utilities will move from buying   completed solar projects to developing them in-house.NextEra Energy,NRG Energy, andDuke Energyhave all developed renewable energy development arms that do more   than just buy projects.To that end,AES(NYSE: AES) bought solar developersPowerfor $1.58 billion late last month. AES has been a leader in   developing energy storage solutions around the country, and now   it's a leader in solar as well.What about solar companies?While utilities are moving more into development, there's   still a big role for solar companies to play. They may not be   doing financing and site selection, but they'll be making panels,   designing tracking solutions, and making integrated solutions   that utility developers will use.If you look at the strategy changes at First Solar and   SunPower over the past year, they fit into this new energy world   perfectly. They've moved from project development to supplying   solutions, such as Oasis from SunPower and the Series 6 product   from First Solar. They're expanding their offerings beyond solar   panels into racking, site design, and inverters, but they may not   be moving as far into the industry as owning projects long   term.Even Tesla is selling most of its energy storage solutions to   utilities or other third-party developers rather than storing   them on the balance sheet.Sticking to what you do bestThere will continue to be tension between utilities and the   solar companies upending their business, but the tension may not   be focused on the utility side in the future. It makes sense for   utilities to stick to project ownership and some development   work, while solar companies offer plug-and-play solutions where   developers need energy. This may lead to a more stable solar   industry long term, and it will make it less risky for investors,   too.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

How Apple Could Spend Its Cash Hoard;3/6/2017;"The problem ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) cash balance is a ""first-world problem"" in   the most literal sense of the phrase.Slightly larger than the annual economic output of Chile,   Apple's cash and marketable securities stockpile lies largely   overseas. As of the company's most recent earnings report, $230   billion of Apple's $246 billion, roughly 93%, was held in   accounts controlled by Apple's international subsidiaries.Apple has caused quite a stir thanks to its controversial   decision to park its foreign profits abroad rather than pay what   it argues are onerous and unfair repatriation taxes. However, the   whiff of tax policy overhaul percolating on Capitol Hill means   this dynamic could soon change. In anticipation of such a   scenario -- and in part because it's just fun to consider -- here   are three realistic ways Apple could deploy its billions in the   bank in the years ahead.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.Idea 1: Major acquisitionApple being a mature company, you often see investors float   the idea of the Mac maker using its cash to fund a major   acquisition whenever this discussion appears. The idea isn't   without merit, either, although it is more complex than it might   seem on the surface for a few reasons.The first hurdle lies in correctly identifying a large company   that jives with Apple's plans for its own future. In terms of   companies that I (subjectively) think could conceivably pair well   with Apple, only a handful of plausible candidates come to mind.   Among them areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , andComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NASDAQ: CMCSK), three legitimately viable   options among publicly traded companies.We know Apple is interested in -- or possibly in the midst of   --developing an electric vehiclefrom the many leaks about its Project Titan, though we don't know   much more than that. Tesla makes the most sense among automakers   for a few reasons. Much like Apple, Tesla's mission is to   fundamentally alter the industries in which it operates. Its   headquarters in California would make working together simpler   than coordinating across the country with Detroit.In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple's   long-held desire to launch its own content streaming service.   Apple's ability to secure content rights from major producers has   been the main thorn in its side. Both Netflix and Comcast control   considerable content rights, though Netflix is newer to this   game. As such, owning either Comcast or Netflix could supply   Apple with the negotiating leverage it needs to finally bring the   required parties to the table.Unfortunately, acquiring any of these companies would require   Apple pay a significant premium to their current prices, which   could be particularly troubling for already-expensive stocks like   Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and   regulatory considerations that could make such a maneuver highly   complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entirely without   merit.Idea 2: More capital return?This comes from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school   of thought since Apple has thus far used its cash reserves to   finance its dividends and share buybacks. To do so, Apple has   cleverly used its overseas riches as collateral to borrow against   to fund its massive capital return programto great effect.Apple has paid out a whopping $201 billion of its current $250   billion capital return program as of its most recent earnings   report, including $15 billion in dividends and buybacks in its   latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Apple generated $27 billion in   operating cash flow last year, and its capex requirements are   minimal -- $3 billion last quarter. This makes the status quo   seem sustainable, although the recent rally inApple stockmakes this option increasingly less appealing.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Stock buybacks become less effective as a company'svaluation increases, so Apple's dramatic multiple expansion has made this tactic   less attractive than it was a year ago. However, with Apple still   trading at a discount to the market, and its cash balance rising,   there's certainly a fair case to be made that further buybacks   and dividends remain a worthy use of Apple's riches.Idea 3: Finance important capex?If Project Titan is indeed real, I think the chances of Apple   implementing this third idea are quite strong. One of the most   important questions Apple must answer along the way is how will   it manufacture the electric vehicle?As I havenotedin the past, automobile manufacturing is a capital-intensive,   low-margin business. This leaves Apple facing a potential   catch-22 with Project Titan, driving meaningful sales growth   while also dramatically eroding its now-cushy profit margins in   the process.Perhaps the best solution to this problem is to follow a   tactic similar to Apple's contract manufacturing arrangements   with Asian assembly specialistsFoxconn. Apple designs products and maintains quality control, but it   hands over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the   process, to someone else. This is how the majority of Apple's   consumer electronics get made today.The key speed bump with this idea is that there are no   large-scale automotive contract manufacturers that exist today to   provide this service to Apple, and that's where Apple's mountains   of money come into play. Assuming it finds a willing and capable   partner to build Project Titan, Apple could use its cash to   finance the construction of the factory infrastructure necessary   to bring Project Titan to life.In fact, Apple has pursued a similar strategy in the past. It   partnered with the now-defunct GT Advanced Technologies to   finance the construction of a factory that GT Advanced planned to   use to produce commercial sapphire for Apple's fingerprint   scanners. If it does so, Apple will want to take great care to   avoid past mistakes, like bankrupting GT Advanced under the   onerous terms of its financing deal. Regardless, this idea is   sound as long as Apple's auto ambitions are indeed as real as   portrayed in the media.Cash is kingOf course, this only scratches the surface in terms of   possible uses of Apple's cash. U.S. tax policy overhaul will also   have a significant influence on Apple's options, so interested   investors will want to stay in tune with the national discussion   around it in the coming months. At the end of the day, though,   Apple's billions in the bank provide it with unparalleled   flexibility to pursue any number of possible actions, and that's   something in which Apple investors can and should find great   comfort.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Ionic Materials and the Plastic Battery: What You Need to Know;3/5/2017;"Pure, metallic lithium. This is a holy grail. These are     what will make an electric car side-by-side competitive with     the internal combustion engine.--Steve LevineIonic Materials enables use of lithium metal anodes, sulfur     cathodes, and more. The result is much higher energy density     and performance.makeArticleAd();-- Ionic MaterialsStab a battery with a screwdriver? Cut it in half? Don't try     this at home -- unless it's a plastic battery from Ionic     Materials. Image source: Ionic Materials.Have you readThe Powerhouse, Steve Levine's epic tale of scientists at the Argonne National   Laboratory working to invent a new battery that will make   electric cars lighter, and let them drive farther, at half the   price of car batteries today?Or perhaps you caughtNOVA'sFeb. 1 episode, which offered a slightly different take on   America's ""search for the super battery"" that will power our   smartphones, our laptops, and even our cars in the future?If so, you may have noticed: All of a sudden,battery science is cool.Building a better TeslaIf you've been following the story of Elon Musk and the   Gigafactory thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is building in the Nevada desert, you may be under   the impression that Musk's ""18650"" lithium-ion batteries are   currently the height of battery technology. Well, they are and   they aren't.Lithium-ion batteries were first commercialized bySony(NYSE: SNE) back in 1991. And, yes, if you pack enough of them   onto a car chassis, you can make a Tesla drive 200, 250, or even   300 miles on a single charge, and yes, that's a greater range   than most other electric cars offer today. But even the 18650s   that the high-tech Gigafactory will churn out employ the same   basic lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum chemistry that's been in use   for more than a decade.Employing a liquid electrolyte to shuttle lithium ions between   anode and cathode, 18650 batteries still carry at least a (small)   risk of incurring a catastrophic meltdown, such as the incidents   thatsunk Samsung stocklast year. And relying on a limited volume of lithium ions (about   2% of the battery's volume), intercalated within a graphite   anode, 18650s still provide less power than you could get from a   pure lithium metal anode -- the aforementioned ""holy grail.""Luckily for electric-car enthusiasts and ""green power""   afficionados, there's a better battery on the way.Introducing Ionic MaterialsIt's called the solid polymer lithium metal battery, and it   was invented in 2011 by Tufts professor and former Bell Labs   researcher Mike Zimmerman, who's now working to   commercialize the prototype for mass production through his new   company, Ionic Materials.Instead of a liquid electrolyte, Ionic uses a solid polymer (a   plasticlike material) to allow lithium ions to flow from anode to   cathode and back again. According to Ionic, this novel type of   electrolyte::offers the ability to function as the cathode     electrolyteexhibits high conductivity at room temperaturehas high voltage stabilityis non-flammableis conducive to high-volume manufacturing techniques.Ionic also uses a lithium metal battery, so there are more   lithium ions to move. That means Ionic's battery packs a   whole lot more punch than the lithium-ion batteries in use today.   Oh, and because it's basically a piece of plastic, it's almost   infinitely malleable and can be manufactured in form factors   conducive to different uses -- long, wide, and flat for powering   tablets or cylindrical to power flashlights. Why, it could even   be molded to fit where needed within a car chassis.As a bonus, it's worlds away from today's lithium-ion   batteries in terms of safety. On last month'sNOVAepisode, host David Pogue attacked Ionic's battery with a   vengeance, piercing it with a screwdriver and snipping off bits   with scissors. Not only did the solid polymer lithium metal   battery not explode (as any other lithium-ion battery would   have), it actually kept working, powering an iPad even as it was   hacked to pieces.When will it arrive?No, you cannot buy one, at least not right away.Ionic Materials was recently awarded a $3 million Advanced   Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) grant from the   Department of Energy. Funding will begin early this year, which   will help to get the ball rolling, but Ionic's battery is not yet   available commercially.The company is ""actively discussing potential partnerships   with leading multi-national materials companies, battery   manufacturers and device OEMs."" But Ionic has released no details   on its potential partnerships as of yet -- meaning we don't yet   knowhow   to investin the technology.That said, Ionic Materials says it expects to find a partner   and begin manufacturing its polymer super-battery as early as   next year.

This Week in Solar;3/4/2017;"As earnings season moves along, we're learning more and more   about what's going on within the solar industry at a tumultuous   time for manufacturers and developers. Strategies are shifting   and alliances are changing, but earnings tell the real story of   what's going on.Below I'll cover a couple of interesting strategic shifts, as   well as policy and earnings updates that happened this week.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Tesla ditches SilevoIf there was any doubt thatTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisition of SolarCity meant the end of   Silevo's technology in the Buffalo, New York, solar factory, now   dubbed Gigafactory 2,Tesla's 2016 10-Kended the debate. Panasonic will be in charge of manufacturing   and Tesla will be little more than a customer. Here's the notable   segment from the filing:In December 2016, we entered into a Production Pricing     Agreement: Phases 1-3 ... with Panasonic Corporation, Panasonic     Corporation of North America and Sanyo Electronic Co., Ltd     (collectively, Panasonic). This agreement provides that     Panasonic will manufacture custom photovoltaic (PV) cells and     modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and that we will     purchase certain amounts of PV cells and modules [from]     Panasonic during the 10-year term, with the intent to produce     PV cells and modules totaling approximately 1 gigawatt annually     beginning in 2019.It's also worth noting that Tesla said Silevo won't meet its   last two milestones associated with the acquisition -- related to   reaching target efficiencies and manufacturing volume and cost --   and recorded an $84 million gain as a result of the contingent   payouts that will now not be made, an amount which was recorded   as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses.The solar manufacturing situation at Tesla appears to be a   complete mess, and with Silevo out, Panasonic is nothing more   than a traditional supplier. It's hard to see how that will lead   to lower costs or higher efficiency than just buying solar panels   on the open market.SunPower has more big plans in ChinaWord trickled out this week thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR)  has signed a deal with Tianjin Zhonghaun   Semiconductor (TZS) and China Eastern Electric Group (Dongfang   Electric Corp.) to create 5 GW of P-Series manufacturing in   China. The agreement was actually reached last week, but   interestingly, management is keeping the deal low-key; it hasn't   made an official announcement yet.The joint venture will reportedly have the two Chinese   companies each owning 10% and SunPower owning 80%. It is the   second big move for SunPower into China after it tried to produce   the C7 concentrator product, which hasn't taken off as planned.   This deal is intended to leverage domestic cell supply to create   solar panels that are slightly more efficient than   competitors'.If this joint venture does create 5 GW of solar panels, it   could be transformative for SunPower. The company would enter a   new level of scale in the solar industry, with a product more   competitive in the utility market than its high-efficiency panels   have been. Time will tell if the agreement works out as   planned.Image source: Getty Images.Update on the solar policy fightThere were two major policy decisions this week that will   impact the solar industry. The first is the EU Commission   extending solar trade duties on Chinese solar cells and modules   for another 18 months. This is notable becauseCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) ,Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) , andJA Solar Holdings(NASDAQ: JASO) have alldropped out of a minimum price schemein Europe and are now paying a tariff that's around 50% of the   cost of a solar panel, depending on the manufacturer. The tariff   will put a damper on demand in Europe, but given the cost   advantages these companies have in China, falling prices   make the impact less and less meaningful.Solar companies and electric company Arizona Public Service   (APS) have settled a contentious rate-design dispute that will   give residential solar a little life in the state. APS won't be   implementing demand charges for all residential and commercial   customers, and will instead give customers the option of a   demand-based rate or time-of-use rate. New rooftop-solar   customers would have to pay a grid access fee but would be   compensated for energy exported to the grid, albeit not at the   same rate as net metering. It's not a perfect solution for solar   companies, but it'll keep the industry from collapsing   overnight.Earnings that slipped through the cracksThere were two notable solar-related earnings reports this   week, fromPattern Energy Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) andNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) , that showed some improvement in the yieldco   space.Pattern Energy said that gigawatt-hours sold jumped 33% in the   fourth quarter to 6,806 GWh, revenue was up 7% to $354.1 million,   and cash available for distribution jumped 44% to $133.0 million.   The company also announced a 1.4% increase in the dividend this   quarter, to $0.41375 per share.NRG Yield's results were fairly mixed, with adjusted EBITDA   (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)   rising from $189 million a year ago to $207 million in the recent   fourth quarter. But the company also swung from a quarterly net   income of $12 million last year to a net loss of $126 million.   These losses aren't necessarily an indication of fundamental   weakness, given that most were impairment losses, which are   non-cash charges and don't impact operations.Check back next week for another recap of what's sure to be   another busy week in solar energy.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla, Inc. Sales in China More Than Tripled in 2016;3/3/2017;"AsTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) prepared to begin deliveries in China in 2014,   management was particularly bullish on the market. Indeed,   Tesla's former China operations chief Veronica Wu estimated sales   in the country would quickly grow to represent a third of the   automaker's deliveries globally. But Tesla's initial predictions   for the market proved to be far too optimistic. Sales in the   market accounted for just 15% of total revenue in 2014 and fell   to 8% of revenue in 2015.In 2016, however, Tesla hit a major turning point in the   country. Tesla revenue in China surged higher in 2016, more than   tripling compared to revenue in the market during 2015, according   to Tesla's most recent 10-K filing (as pointed out byElectrek).Tesla vehicles. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();An unimpressive startAfter beginning deliveries in China in October 2014, hype   surrounding Tesla's expansion to the market faded quickly. Tesla   realized a substantial portion of initial demand was driven by   scalpers, and it dealt with some public relations missteps   related to misperceptions about the difficulty of charging its   electric vehicles in the country.""I'd say that China was certainly a lot weaker than expected,""   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview at the Automotive News   World Congress in January 2015.Despite initial challenges in the market, Tesla remained   confident in the market's long-term potential, and Musk said he   believed the company's situation in the country was   temporary.Tesla spent 2015 working on its image in China, including a   massive expansion of its Supercharger locations. Between the   beginning of December in 2014 and the beginning of January in   2015, Tesla added 16 new Supercharger locations in just 30 days,   bringing total Supercharger locations in China to 56 in early   2015.Supercharger. Image source: author.Tesla's aggressive investments in China continued. Today,   Tesla has 114 Supercharger locations in China. Further, Tesla has   dramatically expanded its footprint of stores and service   centers. Tesla now has an impressive 23 stores and 9 service   centers in China.From $319 million to $1 billionTesla started to see signs of a recovery in the second half of   2015. After orders for Model S nearly doubled between Q1 and Q2,   Tesla said Model S orders ""increased substantially"" in Q3   compared to Q2. And management indicated this growth was poised   to continue.""We expect order growth in China to remain strong with more   store openings and the recent policy changes in Beijing and other   major cities that allow buyers of Tesla vehicles to bypass   license plate restrictions,"" Tesla said in its Nov. 3   third-quarter update.Tesla's predictions for sustained order growth in China have   proved accurate, as Tesla's revenue in China surged from $319   million in 2015, or 8% of revenue, to about $1.1 billion in 2016,   or 15% of revenue.China has undoubtedly proved to be a key catalyst for Tesla.

Ahead of Model 3 Production, Tesla Inc.'s Spending Is About to Soar;3/3/2017;"Even though 2016 was a big year of growth forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , as revenue and vehicle deliveries soared, the   electric-car maker's capital expenditures during the year   declined impressively compared with 2015. But Tesla investors   shouldn't get comfortable with this lower level of spending:   Management expects capital expenditures to jump during the first   half of 2017.A temporary pullbackTesla's pullback in capital spending last year was certainly   notable. Capital expenditures declined from $1.6 billion in 2015   to $1.3 billion in 2016. Even more, expenditures were far below   the $2.25 billion threshold Tesla said it expected to hit by the   end of the year.Tesla factory. Image source: Author.makeArticleAd();However, despite a slowdown in capital spending during 2016,   Tesla still managed to grow its business substantially:Revenue and deliveries soared 73% and 51%, respectively,     year over year.Between July and the end of the year, Tesla's Gigafactory     grew from 1.9 million operational square feet on its multiple     levels to4.9 million square feet.Production of battery cells began at the Gigafactory.Global store and service center locations increased     26%.Supercharger connections increased by 46%.Tesla ramped up Model X production from a few hundred units a   quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015 to nearly 10,000 a quarter   by the end of 2016.Meanwhile, Tesla emphasized throughout the year that its less   substantial capital spending in 2016 didn't mean the company   wasn't hitting its milestones for its capital plan. The lower   level of spending, management explained, was simply a byproduct   of careful expense management, capital efficiency, and more   favorable payment terms with suppliers.Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler explained how the company has been   able to stretch out payables longer than expected in the   company's fourth-quarter earnings call:I think this is one of the benefits of having a very     successful run over the last couple of years. We have developed     a lot of trust with our suppliers ... to sum it up, we're     making great progress in stretching out our payables, and we're     doing that in a way that I think is productive and healthy with     the relationships with our suppliers and members.Tesla's capital efficiency and progress on payment terms in   2016 was an impressive feat.Big spending is already underwayHowever, while this year-over-year decrease in capital   expenditures highlights Tesla's careful expense management and   capital efficiency, it doesn't diminish just how   capital-intensive it will be for Tesla to launch its Model 3 in   the second half of 2017 and to ramp up production from a run rate   of 100,000 Model S and X units today to management's expected   annual production of 500,000 units for Model S, X, and 3 combined   in 2018. Tesla still expects a significant jump in capital   spending -- and the sharp increase is already getting   started.Tesla's under-construction Gigafactory. Image source:     Author.As Tesla readies Model 3 to come to the assembly line in July,   management expects to invest between $2 billion and $2.5 billion   in capital expenditures in the first half of 2017 -- an   approximately 190% increase from capital spending in the second   half of 2016.Tesla has already begun demonstrating a ramp-up in capital   spending. In its fourth quarter, Tesla invested $522 million in   capital expenditures, up from $248 million in Q3.Increasing production capacity fivefold isn't going to be   cheap. And investors are about to get a taste of just how   capital-intensive the auto business is.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Inc.: How to Buy AMZN Stock at a Much-Needed Discount;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's more than OK to like purchasing fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But if you're looking to buy AMZN stock, it may be smarter to delay that buy decision. That's because you can wrap up a discount using the proper technique.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs most consumers know by now, there's a lot to like about shopping at Amazon. There's also a lot to like these days about AMZN stock. A month ago, the online retailing gianttrumped profit viewsby nearly 12.5% in delivering earnings of $1.54 per share.Sales for Q4 did come in a tad light, but the sheer size of Amazon's $43.7 billion in revenues for the holiday quarter, can't in our opinion, be discounted too much without looking like the Grinch. After all, sales grew by a nothing-to-sneeze at 27% to $136 billion for the full year, powering a three-fold increase in profits over 2015.Cash flow also jumped 38% to $16.4 billion, and the company's latest growth engine, Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered a solid 47% in its quarterly sales.So, what'snotto like about AMZN stock right now?Management did trim, to put it mildly, its profit outlook for 2017 with a range of $250 million to $900 million versus the Street's forecast of $1.33 billion.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The good news is Amazon's warning isn't nearly as damaging as it looks on first inspection. The ""weak"" guidance factors in aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India. And as proof, after an initial and apparently short-sighted ""sell, sell, sell!"" by investors - Amazon stock has delivered the gift of fresh all-time-highs just last week.But are Amazon shares offering you something worth buying right now?AMZN Stock ChartLooking at Amazon's chart, the question ""Is it, or isn't it?"" comes to mind as shares flirt with a multiday test of its prior highs from October.Click to EnlargeWith a substantial corrective move wedged between the former high of $847.21 and price action over the past week or two, AMZN stock has put together either a bullish cup-with-handle or potentially bearish variation on the classic double-top pattern.Which side holds the directional edge moving forward? My best estimate is there's some likely pressure in Amazon's near future.First off, one warning is that Amazon shares officially broke out on Feb. 21 but have had difficulty going higher. Also worrisome is Amazon's ability to rally strongly past the breakout level, which has been accompanied by less-than-terrific volume and a lack of support from stochastics.We expect modest profit-taking, so if you're interested in buying AMZN, there are better times - and ways - to enter.How to Trade AMZN StockFor investors that do wish to eventually purchase AMZN stock at slightly more advantageous prices or maybe a much larger discount and get paid to wait it out-a credit put spread looks attractive.Reviewing Amazon's options and given our view of shares prone to at least a modest pullback, the Weeklys 07' April $815 / $810 put spread is priced for $1.00 with AMZN stock at $847.60.Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?The real disadvantage with this strategy is if our forecast is wrong and shares of Amazon rally higher by a meaningful amount. Were that to occur, the trader's $1.00 in profits will look like a poor decision relative to buying AMZN stock today.But if AMZN sits or simply fails to drop below $815 or nearly 4% over the next five weeks, the full credit is captured and the trader will be sitting pretty compared to a more bullish trader that simply purchased stock.Even better, if more aggressive profit-taking does happen, ultimately the vertical limits the investor's risk to $4.00 regardless of how low AMZN stock might go during the spread's holding period. And opportunistically, if the investor is still inclined to be a buyer of Amazon shares, that can work out to a very sizable discount.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeadlines and oversold stocks take the lead on today's three big stock charts, as we take a look at the charts forCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT),Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) to determine whether one or all of these are ready to offer traders bullish opportunities as they potentially regain their recent highs.makeArticleAd();Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar shares plummeted on Thursday as news thatfederal agencies had raided some of their corporate offices. The stock's dive was stopped by the 100-day moving average. This trendline has now served as support for Caterpillar shares three times since October 2016.Typically, a headline-driven selling day like this can be hard to step in on, but a few other things didn't happen that would have served as warning of greater declines.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowFirst, CAT stock did not break below its lower Bollinger band, signaling that, as volatile as yesterday's move was, it still fell within a somewhat normal distribution for the stock. Second, the stock didn't move far enough away from its 50-day to imagine that we couldn't see it move back above this key trendline today.These two points, along with the fact that yesterday's selling volume suggests that investors may have rushed out of CAT stock too quickly, leaving a vacuum that may be easily filled by buyers, now leads us to take a short-term bullish trade outlook on Caterpillar shares.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Say it ain't so! Could this be it for the long-term bullish run in Nvidia shares? The stock broke through the psychologically important $100 level earlier this week and has seen an acceleration in selling since then. Now, shares are trading at $96.65 and looking helpless. Well, not exactly.Nvidia is getting ready to hit potential support at its 200-day moving average. This is the same line that the stock came close to grabbing support from last week before a short-term bounce. In addition, Nvidia shares are also touching down to oversold reading of their RSI, indicating that the selling pressure that has been moving the stock lower may start running thin.That said, what would a bullish trade look like on Nvidia? Well, we want to see support at $94.35 hold, as NVDA hits these oversold readings. This should be enough to trigger a short-term rally. From there, we want to see NVDA take out the 50-day moving average, which is currently at $107.63 (of course, after breaking above $100 again). This would put shares back into rally mode.The risk? A break below $94, or rejection at $100 on a short-term rally, will likely open the path to another selloff that could see NVDA shares break to $80. This one is well worth keeping an eye on.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Ahead of Tesla's earnings we talked about the ""buy the rumor"" rally that signaled us to stay on the sidelines with the stock for the report. Well, the ""sell the news"" action took the stock back to its 50-day moving average where things are beginning to look more attractive for Tesla from a trading perspective.The stock shed 13% after the report to hit its 50-day trendline at $240. Conveniently, the $240 has also showed some signs of round-numbered support and resistance in the past on the Tesla chart.While shares did not hit an oversold reading on the RSI, they did work their way out of an extremely overbought situation that had developed ahead of earnings. This means that the stock would be moving against less of a headwind to rally higher from this point.Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Is Fundamentally Strong, Which Is Why I'm Shorting ItOur scoring system continues to rank Tesla shares as a ""buy"" based on the strong technical and fundamental results of the company with targets that are nearing the $300 level. The latest round of technical support should clear way for traders to take the stock back to its short-term highs at $280 over the next few weeks.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in March7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Caterpillar Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales Ever;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs last year's holiday sales were ramping up,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) faced claims that its Apple Watch was in trouble. Smartwatch sales were down - with AAPL doing worse than most - and some analysts were calling for a miserable Q4. Apple CEO Tim Cook even took the unusual measure of speaking to the press to claim Apple Watch sales were actually off the charts.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleHowever, IDC just released its numbers for Q4 wearables, and it looks like Apple was right. It booked its best Apple Watch Q4 numbers to date.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), on the other hand, didn't do so well.The IDC Numbers on Q4 2016 Wearables SalesIDC just released itsnumbers for Q4 2016 wearables sales. This covers both fitness trackers and smartwatches. Overall sales were up 16.9% year-over-year with 102.4 million wearable devices being shipped during the quarter, worldwide.The firm noted a continuing trend toward smartwatch makers adopting an activity tracking approach, while traditional fitness tracker makers - like Fitbit - scrambled to add features, becoming multi-use devices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets - LiterallyThe results for the quarter show that Apple's strategy of making its second generation smartwatch even more fitness focused paid off, with record Apple Watch sales.IDC had this to say:""AppleWatch Series 1 and Series 2 proved to be a magnificent success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment.""Fitbit, on the other hand, had a miserable quarter. Its smart wearables like the Blaze weren't enough to fend off the Apple Watch.The U.S. market (where its marketing is focused) is approaching saturation for basic fitness trackers. China'sXiaomicranked out cheap fitness trackers and added new more upscale models with features like heart rate tracking.As a result, for Q4 Apple Watch sales were up 13% (to 4.6 million units for the quarter) and Xiaomi was up 96.2% (5.2 million units). Fitbit maintained its first-place position, but sold just 6.5 million units, a 22.7% drop compared to last year.Q4 Smartwatch Sales Show AAPL's Fitness Focus Paying OffThe IDC numbers vindicate Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments in December. Speaking in response to a a report (from IDC, ironically) that suggested the smartwatch category was in trouble and the Apple Watch would face ""muted"" success,Cook responded:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""That comment was looked at with some suspicion at the time. It seemed a little defensive and vague.Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?The Apple Watch series 2, launched in September, featured a renewed focus on fitness and activity, including a built-in GPS that freed it from the smartwatch for running. A partnership withNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) resulted in theApple Watch Nike+aimed offered sports enthusiasts.At the same time, Apple tweaked the performance of the Apple Watch and has continually improved its watchOS operating system.With record Q4 Apple Watch sales that exceeded the numbers from its launch year -when excitement about the all new smartwatch was running high- AAPL's strategy is clearly paying off. And contrary to that earlier IDC report from last year, the Apple Watch is enjoying better than ""muted"" success.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago;3/3/2017;"Snapchat (Shutterstock photo)Many on Wall Street are comparing Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that's okay. All three can be considered social networks, rely on daily active users and generate the majority of their revenue from advertising.In the future, however, Snap may wind up being more like another Silicon Valley giant than the aforementioned ones -- Apple (AAPL).makeArticleAd();Buying stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company's prowess as an advertising behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionary the world has not seen seen Apple's Steve Jobs and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.There are similarities between Jobs and Spiegel, both starting their companies after dropping out of college, are wonderful salesmen and marketers, but the similarities go further than that.Jobs is Spiegel's idol; he has a portrait of the legendary Apple co-founder hanging in his office. When unveiling Spectacles toThe Wall Street Journalthis past fall, he even used Jobs-ian language, saying ""You wanna see it?"" as he took off the towel covering the product. This mentality plays to the culture of secrecy at both companies, not releasing products until they are ready to be talked about.And unlike other technology companies, neither Snap or Apple have ""beta"" products. There is no group of early adopters buying and using a product so the companies can get an idea of how users are interacting with it and then continue to refine. Every meticulous detail is thought out and obsessed over and is not released until it's perfect.Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony said the company's most valuable asset is its demographic, with 13-24 year olds comprising nearly 60% of its user base. While these are highly coveted by advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company's most valuable asset. The ability to know what people want before they want or see it is an invaluable trait that very few executives have. It can not be measured or valued, but it's something that investors need to keenly aware of when looking at where to put their investing dollars.Snap has positioned and sold itself as a camera company, having mentioned that multiple times in its S-1. This can allow them to expand into everything and anything that has a camera.Despite the optimism surrounding Spiegel, the stickiness of Snapchat (engagement levels are shockingly high) and the coveted user base, it's not all roses for Snap at this stage.There are concerns about the company's financial picture, as it still generates the majority of its revenue from advertising. Going up against Facebook and Google, which have mountains of user data that advertisers love, can be a daunting task (just ask Twitter).Issues surrounding slowing user growth, the ability for competitors to copy product features, lack of data analytics, no voting control with Class A shares are all valid reasons to be wary of Snap, especially at a $35 billion valuation.But again, it comes down to be at the forefront of an area that's only going to expand with a product visionary for a CEO.Images, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, moving or static, are humanity's future. All you have to do is just look at the popularity of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, its burgeoning hardware portfolio and most importantly Spiegel, is poised to be at the forefront of this trend for many years to come."

Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)took a beating last week, falling 4.5% to a low of $250.20 despite the electric vehicle company reporting broadly positive fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. While TSLA stock has recovered this week, shares still are off 10% from before its Q4 report, and 13% from its all-time closing high from mid-February.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)Investors who have waited for a solid buying opportunity now have their chance.Not only did Tesla post a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, it also said revenues beat expectations. Notably, thesepositive resultswere the first since the company closed its $2 billion acquisition ofSolarCityin November.Plus, Tesla said the development of its Model 3 mass-market vehicle remains on track, saying ""initial production"" will begin in July, with volume production to follow in September.However. Tesla also dropped a bombshell on the market, announcing that chief financial officer Jason Wheeler, who was appointed to the post in November 2015, will leave the company in April.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowWheeler, who became Tesla CFO from his role as vice president of finance atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, is leaving to pursue a position in public policy. He will bereplaced by Deepak Ahuja, who retired in 2015 after seven years at the company.""I Told You So"" MomentTesla critics, who have been skeptical of the company's financial position and itsrate of cash burn, took Wheeler's departure as the ""I told you so"" moment. Indeed, this is a critical time for Tesla and TSLA stock, particularly as the company aims to compete withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) in vehicle mass-market production.But while Wheeler's departure after 14 months might seem discouraging, it's not the death blow to Tesla stock that the recent decline might suggest.What's more important is how Tesla can deliver on Model 3 production estimates and boost demand for the Model S and Model X in the quarters ahead. Plus, Ahuja, who will replace Wheeler, is described as a ""very thoughtful"" CFO who understands the inner workings of the company, according to Consumer Edge Research senior analystJames Albertine.Ahuja's appointment could also be a sign that Tesla is maturing and will begin to focus more on profitability and growing its margins,Activate CEO Michael Wolfsaid in an interview with BloombergTV.Because of increased Model 3 production costs, among other growing expenses, Tesla's gross margins showed a significant decline to 19.1% in the fourth quarter from 27.7% in the third quarter. Though the Model 3 is reported ago have a start price of $35,000, Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each car.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsAs such, Ahuja's main job coming in will be to convince a jittery market that Tesla won't lose money on each car it manufactures, which appears to be the current trend.Bottom Line for TSLA StockAhuja will rejoin the company in March ahead of Wheeler's April departure in order to ""ensure a smooth transition,"" CEO Elon Musk said during Wednesday's conference call.Betting on Tesla is a wager on Ahuja and a belief that Musk can deliver on his promises. With TSLA stock still down double digits from its all-time high, placing a long-term bet here could pay off.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowNetflix, Inc.

Tesla's Guidance for Model S and X Deliveries: What Investors Should Know;3/2/2017;"InTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management   understandably refrained from providing guidance beyond the first   half of 2017. Given that the second half of the year is expected   to include the unpredictable production ramp of Tesla's upcoming   higher-volume Model 3, guidance for such an uncertain outcome   could do more harm than good for investors.But what's interesting about the guidance for vehicle   deliveries Tesla did provide is that it's not nearly as ambitious   as it looks at first glance.Model S (left) and Model X (right). Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();Understanding Tesla's guidanceFor its expectations for deliveries before Model 3 debuts   during the second half of the year, Tesla said it expects to   ""deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined   in the first half of 2017, representing vehicle delivery growth   of 61% to 71% compared with the same period last year.""This is some big growth, right? It depends on how you look at   it. On a year-over-year basis, this growth is an acceleration   from the 27% year-over-year growth Tesla posted in its fourth   quarter. But when investors zoom out and look at what this means   for the trajectory of Tesla's combined Model S and X units on a   sequential basis, Tesla isn't expecting much growth at all.   Compared to combined Model S and X deliveries in the second half   of 2016, 47,000 to 50,000 deliveries in the first half of 2017   would be up just 0% to 6%.And assuming Tesla's late 2015-introduced Model X continues to   account for a larger percentage of the electric-car maker's sales   over the next few quarters as the company ramps up production of   the newer vehicle, this guidance may mean management expects its   Model S sales to decline. In fact, Model S sales have already   turned downward. In Tesla's fourth quarter of 2016, Model S sales   were down 21% sequentially and 26% year over year.Still a successOf course, if Tesla's combined Model S and X deliveries do   level off at the 100,000-unit run rate they're at today, this   would still be an impressive volume for two luxury models priced   between $68,000 and $168,000. Indeed, Model S is already the   best-selling large luxury sedan in this price range in the U.S.   by a long shot. And Tesla's Model X SUV already accounts for   about 6% of U.S. large luxury SUV sales.Furthermore, based on Tesla's update on demand for Model S and   X in the company's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, a   meaningful decline in combined Model S and X sales in the coming   quarters looks highly unlikely.""Model S and X net order growth remains strong, as we are   continually evolving our products by elevating performance,   convenience, and safety,"" management explained. Tesla also said   Model S and X orders hit a record high during the quarter and   were up 49% year over year.Finally, it's worth noting that abrupt pauses in Tesla's   sequential growth have occurred in the past on several occasions.   Indeed, in 2016, combined Model S and X deliveries declined 15%   and 3% sequentially in Q1 and Q2, respectively, before they   skyrocketed 72% sequentially in Q3.Model X. Image source: Author.It's fair to say, therefore, that year-over-year growth has   proved to be the best way for investors to see the bigger picture   when it comes to Tesla's ability to grow sales. And despite   Tesla's expectations for flat sales going into the first half of   2017 compared to the second half of 2016, it would likely serve   investors well to still take a moment to acknowledge just how   sharp Tesla's year-over-year growth remains.Sure, this doesn't mean Tesla can continue growing Model S and   Model X sales sharply or even at all. But Tesla's continued   ability to increase sales at 50%-plus rates annually since Model   S was first launched demonstrates Tesla's consistent execution on   its growth plans on a year-over-year basis, and it bodes well for   the company's ambitious growth outlook for Model 3.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

U.S. light-vehicle sales fell 1.1% year over year to 1.33 million units in Feb 2017. Per Autodata Corp., the demand for cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks inched down to an annualized pace of 17.6 million vehicles in February, from 17.7 million recorded a year ago.2. AutoZone reported 8.8% year-over-year growth in earnings per share to $8.08 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Feb 11, 2017) from $7.43 in the year-ago quarter.

Earlier this week, Takata pleaded guilty to criminal wrong-doing in a Detroit federal court case in relation to the faulty airbags supplied by it. The company has agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties, of which it will pay $25 million as criminal fine, $125 million to injured consumers or those who could be affected and $850 million to auto manufacturers currently facing the recall costs. Automakers are in the process of recalling about 42 million affected vehicles.In a separate court filing, the auto makers have been accused of using Takata airbags to save costs in spite of being aware of the risks. Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and BMW AG have been particularly charged.4. Ford plans to cut 1,100 jobs at its Wales, U.K. engine plant, as per trade unions GMB and Unite. However, the company has dismissed the claim, stating that it had no immediate plan for cuts and did not confirm any future plan regarding the same. Last year, Ford had decided to lower investments in Britain due to lack of demand but did not announce any job retrenchment plans.Conversely, the union company heads stated that 1,100 will be laid off, leaving 600 employees at the site, over the next five years. Both the unions have decided to consult their members and a strike is probable. Ford, alternately, proposed that a joint working party be set up with both unions, to identify the future business needs.Ford carries a Zacks Rank #3.5. Tesla's sales in China for 2016 were significantly higher in comparison to 2015. The company's revenues grew to $1.07 billion from $318.5 million earned in the previous year. The company had initially faced concerns in the country, including slow deliveries and apprehensions regarding charging.Tesla also reported 12,243 employees at SolarCity, down 19.8% year over year owing to its target to preserve cash and reduce expenses.

Why Tesla Had to Lay Off 3,000 SolarCity Employees;3/2/2017;"CEO Elon Musk called it ""a dirty word"": synergies.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisition of sister company SolarCity last   year was an incredibly contentious and polarizing deal. Some saw   it as a bailout, while others bought into Musk's vision of a   vertically integrated sustainable energy company. Independent of   which side of the fence you're on, Tesla did commit itself to   realizing $150 million in direct cost synergies within the first   full year after closing. Those cost synergies were largely   comprised of ""sales and marketing efficiencies"" as well as   general corporate and overhead savings.But ""efficiencies"" almost always translates into layoffs when   it comes to mergers and synergies, which is why Tesla had to lay   off 3,000 SolarCity employees last year.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Sales and marketing expectedly took the biggest hitBoth Tesla and SolarCity filed their respective 10-Ks   yesterday, and total headcount saw a 20% reduction to 12,243   employees. That represents a little over 3,000 employees that   were let go, with sales and marketing receiving the most   cuts.Job Function20152016Change (YOY)Operations, installations, and manufacturing6,8735,332(22%)Sales and marketing5,6614,155(27%)R&D and general and administrative2,7392,7560.1%Total15,27312,243(20%)Data source: SEC filings.Last year marks the first time that SolarCity's total   headcount posted an annual decline. Some of this was already   known, although the degree of which was previously unclear. The   company had a high-profile exit from Nevada following an   unfavorable regulatory ruling regarding net metering, which   severely impacted the economic viability of solar systems within   the state.In August 2016, SolarCity alsodisclosedthat it would be working on reducing operating expenses ""to match   the Company's reduced guidance"" on installations, as SolarCity   began shifting its focus away from growth and emphasizing a more   sustainable cost structure. At the time, SolarCity said it would   incur $3 million to $5 million in restructuring charges, while   co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive both dropped their   annual salaries down to $1.The other half of the equationIt's important to distinguish between cost synergies and   revenue synergies. While the $150 million in cost synergies that   Tesla is targeting is important, revenue synergies are just as --   if not more -- important since Tesla hopes to transform the way   that people purchase solar systems. Instead of labor-intensive   channels like door-to-door sales or retail lead generation, Tesla   hopes to create a one-stop shop where customers can purchase a   fully integrated system that includes an electric vehicle, solar   system, and battery storage -- a transaction that could easily be   $70,000 or more.It remains unclear if this vision will resonate with consumers   or if it will prove to be cost-effective, but it certainly has   the potential. Much like with electric cars, solar sales have a   steep educational curve, which is partially why the existing   distribution methods are so labor-intensive. Revamping sales   channels combined with needing to generate cost synergies is a   recipe for layoffs.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Stock Is a Falling Machete. Catch It!;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) reported earnings on Tuesday evening, and the stock market is reacting violently Wednesday morning to the news. PANW stock is down 20% today, and while I'm usually not one to risk my fingers trying to catch falling knives, I find myself interested in today's action.makeArticleAd();Besides, using the options markets, I can structure a trade that would allow me to start long with room for error.Yes, Palo Alto Networks' revenues missed, but fundamentally - very, very broadly fundamentally - not much has changed. As the world becomes more digitally dependent, it will need cyber security more than ever. PANW is a major provider, so it's a matter of going back to better execution on its management plans.Usually, investors will give a company a few passes on bad earnings. Unless specifically stated, the assumption is that it was a temporary bad situation that caused the quarter's disappointment.PANW stock is no stranger to bad earnings reactions - previous drops were entry opportunities that rewarded those who stepped in on red days.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteToday's drop brings Palo Alto stock price close to a level that was defended well since the market lows of February 2016. Furthermore, shares emphatically broke out of the $120 area in 2014. PANW should require a complete breakdown in the story to relinquish it to the bears again.Click to EnlargeMy last trade on PANW was a 2016 winning iron condor between $156 per share and $90. I sold risk against both these levels and was lucky enough to expire both sides for max gains. This is a fast-moving stock, so selling risk could be difficult to manage. When dealing with momentum stocks, I find it best to use longer-dated options.Today, instead of selling a range, I will sell downside risk. The goal: Profiting on a stabilization and partial bounce in Palo Alto shares.How to Trade PANW Stock Right NowThe Bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $75 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $2.5 per contract to open. The 35% price buffer gives this trade a 85% theoretical chance of success. I need PANW stock to close above my sold risk to win. It is important to note that if the drop today is almost equal to the price buffer of this trade. So I have to be ready and willing to own Palo Alto at $85 should price falls below it.Not everyone is open to selling naked risk. I can restructure this trade to better suit milder risk profiles. This trade would also be a better fit for smaller accounts.Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Won't Stop Growing Anytime SoonThe Alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $85/$80 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 90 cents per contract to open. The 28% price buffer gives this trade an 80% theoretical chance of success. If PANW stock closes above my sold risk, I stand to gain over 20% yield on risk.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade. In this case, I will refrain from doing so since the drop is too big and I would be selling the upside risk at a severe discount.Instead, I chose longer-dated options which usually allow for easier risk management should the price action continues to go against me. I am not required to hold my options trades open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

3 Catalysts That Will Propel Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) remains a strong brand that is backed by some of the biggest names in sports, including Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Jordan Spieth and many more.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, a disconnect exists between the Under Armour brand and UAA stock, as the company'sfourth-quarter reportmade it clear that investors had expected too much. Management, too, was equally guilty of inflated expectations.Long-term investors are certainly feeling the pain as Under Armour stock trades near multi-year lows while the markets trade at all-time highs. Better days are ahead, though, and I have three convincing arguments as to why.UAA Stock Catalyst: Expectations Are ResetNow that the damage to UAA stock has been done, step one of the rebound is to exceed the now-lowered expectations. Let's take a look at what the Street is modeling in the near-term. According to data compiled by Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street analysts expect Under Armour's Q1 revenue to be $1.11 billion, which represents roughly a 6% year-over-year growth, but a sequential decline from $1.3 billion in the most recently announced quarter.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Is this achievable? Based on recent history, the answer is a clear yes. In Q4, Under Armour's year-over-year revenue rose 12%, Q3 it rose 22%, Q2 it rose 28% and in the first quarter, it rose 30%.So 6% year-over-year growth is well below the company's historical trend. The easy setup heading into the first-quarter earnings report could represent the first major catalyst that could jolt shares back higher.Baby steps are key here to reestablishing faith in the company.UAA Stock Catalyst: Lapsing of a Major HeadwindUnder Armour is still feeling the pain from Sports Authority's bankruptcy. Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at The NPD Group,toldForbesthat SA's bankruptcy could still haunt UA through Q1, ""but after that the drag should be over and trend should return to normal.""What Powell left out is that Under Armour's products are now sold inKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS) stores, which presents the company with a new distribution expansion opportunity. This also represents a catalyst which peers likeNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) realized years, if not decades, ago. If Under Armour achieves success in Kohl's stores, it could prompt the company to expand into other retail chains. The company'sArmoury shop-in-shop conceptat Champs also serves as a sign of its dedication toward promoting its brand in the mall.Here's a crazy thought - maybe Under Armour can occupy a presence outside of its core sporting goods channel and build up a strong presence at stores like Famous Footwear, which is owned byCaleres Inc(NYSE:CAL). After all, it does sell a compelling set of basketball shoes backed by one of the hottest NBA stars - Steph Curry.UAA Stock Catalyst: New CFO to the Rescue?Under Armour's sales growth has been accompanied with a similar growth in SG&A spend. But since sales are no longer growing at the same pace as previously expected, management would be wise to cut back on spending initiatives (without compromising on the necessary investments to support the brand, such as product innovation and supply chain.)This can be done. For starters, no more acquisitions. No more spending hundreds of millions of dollars for fitness apps - the category is a nightmare - justlook atFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) - so it can cut back here. Also, management can focus on promoting and supporting existing stores without opening new ones and also scale back on marketing expenses.Ironically enough, Under Armour is still searching for a new CFO. So naturally, the announcement of a new executive whose first order of business is cutting spending would be met with cheers.Bottom Line on Under Armour IncAdidas AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY) has proven that a down-and-out athletic brand can make a comeback. The global athletic wear market is valued at around $300 billion, which means it is certainly large enough for Under Armour to continue growing and, bit by bit, steal share from the big boys.Elon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockNo one is saying that Under Armour is the next Nike, but it has proven itself very capable of growing over time. Now that expectations have been completely reset, it is reasonable to believe that UAA can, at the very least, beat the low bar and send UAA stock soaring.As of this writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 MLPs to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announced slightly lower same-store sales during the holiday season, and investors dumped BBY stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrThe drop was minor, less than 1%. But it was unexpected, and missed analyst estimates of a top-line gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy reported earnings of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenue of $13.48 billion. This compared with earnings of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenue of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjusted profits of $1.95 per share easily beat estimates of $1.67, revenues fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.The revenue shortfall meant analysts threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retailers such asMacy's Inc.(NYSE:M), with shares down almost 5% early Wednesday, to $42.40. During the Christmas season, on Dec. 8, the shares traded as high as $49.31.Were the analysts right, or did they just offer smart investors a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is this just a case of Moore's Law in action?Great Expectations for Best BuyBest Buy even trounced the higher earnings whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswere all over the map, with some very bearish about the company's ability to cut costs and others bullish on margins.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The Zacks Metric Model noted that BBY stock had beaten estimates for four quarters, and that shareholders had been rewarded with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy was posting big gains in online sales - the so-called ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zacks was expecting an upside surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy delivered one. And considering the sizable beat, BBY shares should've rocketed higher.But something else is at play … and that something is Moore's Law.Moore's Law Hits the Top LineMoore's Law, which turned 50 in 2015, was described byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore as an expected increase in circuit density on silicon, doubling every 18 months ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been writing for many years now, Moore's Law alsoturned traditional economics on its head. Moore's Law is deflationary, and the deflationary impact grows with time, as integrated circuits are incorporated into more and more things, and as the impact is compounded by its use in various ways.In the case of Best Buy, this means the products it sells lose value as soon as they leave the factory, and the retailer is under enormous pressure to get them out the door before their value disappears. This isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company's primary growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unaffordable just a few years ago - 5 feet wide on the diagonal - is now available at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen sets just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still makes money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and this is true for all consumer electronics. Whole categories that used to represent big profits, like back-up drives, DVD players and packaged software, have disappeared as consumers find they can get and save files to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBY StockThe new administration wants to whip deflation now and, by allowing price hikes on oil and other resources, they could achieve the goal. China, too, seems dedicated to fighting deflation, giving raises to many workers in a more competitive market.This should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focusing more on products like ovens and washing machines that have mechanical parts which sometimes break. A new round of high-end phones should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earnings multiple of under 14, and a dividend yielding 2.5% (that the company is in a great position to raise), BBY stock might be Best Buy's best bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) buysMacy's Inc(NYSE:M). It's a crazy idea, right? AMZN stock has barely budged over the past couple of weeks sincereportssurfaced that Canada'sHudson's Bay Co(OTCMKTS:HBAYF) was in talks to buy America's largest seller of apparel. Clearly, investors aren't holding their breath.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe media, on the other hand, has been busy speculating on the odds of a company like Amazon getting into a bidding war with the iconic Canadian retailer that is run by an American and also ownsSaks IncandLord & Taylor.Opinions vary on whether Amazon boss Jeff Bezos would make such a move, but let me assure you, it won't be for the real estate.No, if AMZN does make a play for Macy's it will be for other, more-sensible business reasons. In fact, you could say Amazon would be taking a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon's biggest rivals in electronics retail.How's that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you missed it, Amazon has been slowly entering the apparel businesssince debutingits own private-label brands in early 2016 with 1,800 products available for sale under names such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Society New York.Essentially, it's trying to fill the gaps not covered by its third-party sellers. However, a bigger attraction of doing its own thing isn't lost on investors of AMZN stock, which is that you make more selling your own stuff than you do somebody else's.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccording to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expected to pass Macy's in 2017 as America's top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.While it could do most of this through its websites, having brick-and-mortar stores has always been on the minds of analysts and retail experts alike.""We believe this deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consumer pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a recent report discussing the possibility of it buying Macy's. ""Amazon needs better brands, a more curated assortment, a physical place to return items, and customers could use help with ensuring fit - Macy's would also give Amazon greater credibility in curation and fashion authority.""That last part's a bit of stretch. I'm pretty sure if Amazon knocked on your door and you're a private label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantage of its private label expansion, real estate is going to become an important part of the equation as AMZN expands into brick-and-mortar locations. It's not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abundance of retail real estate coming on stream through all the various store closings across America, including68 Macy's stores- part of the bigger 100 store closings announcement from last summer - in 2017, so finding space isn't going to be a problem for AMZN.If you remember what happened toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buying all those leases in one big deal ultimately was its undoing because it put way too much pressure on its employees to execute such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it has stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decade or longer to execute. If it really wants to open retail stores this isn't an appropriate solution for a growth company like AMZN.Why Best Buy?Business wasn't looking good for the Minneapolis-based electronics retailer until CEO Hubert Joly turned the company upside down in 2012 implementing its infamous ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turned physical store locations into local distribution hubs for its e-commerce business.Former CFO Sharon McCollamcalled the ship-from-storeinitiative in February 2016 ""one of the most important and strategic decisions in (Best Buy's) history.""The numbers don't lie. In November, Best Buydelivered strongstrong Q3 2017 results that included continued growth for its e-commerce business along with positive same-store sales growth. It's taken multi-channel retail to the next level.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company""Best Buy's third quarter online growth of over 24% results in a very solid quarter, and continues to validate the company's multi-channel transformation,"" Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Sheasaid in November.Renew Blue's been such a success that retail expert Walter Loeb named Joly his 2016 Retailer of the Year.Bottom Line on AMZN StockBy acquiring Macy's, AMZN would be able to push its products onto the store floors where it could learn more about what apparel shoppers want, while seriously lowering its shipping expenses by implementing a ship-from-store initiative much like Best Buy.Yes, it's already invested billions in warehouses across the country, but getting closer to the customer is never a bad thing; buying Macy's might not happen but if it does, it's got nothing to do with owning real estate and everything to do with AMZN owning the customer.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceElon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its End7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The postCould Amazon.com, Inc.

While Q4 results were mixed, trends in the wireless business pointed towards stabilization in terms of the subscriber base and the churn rate.Market participants also appear to be satisfied with AT&T's strategic moves like the DirectTV purchase and the pending Time Warner deal even as Verizon's path seems muddled. That said, there is no shortage of issues facing the company, like a saturated wireless market where spectrum crunch is a big issue, persistent losses in access lines, and stringent regulatory mandates.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market is making new highs seemingly every day. TheS&P 500,Nasdaq Compositeand other major indices are in uncharted territory, and the stock that value investors doubted is following suit.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is now worth $720 billion by market capitalization. And improbably, the $1 trillion mark - at $189 per share for AAPL stock, that's still a lofty 40% away - is at least in the realm of possibility now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlso improbably, Apple stock, at around 16 times earnings, is somewhere between undervalued and fairly valued. Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) still believes in the value proposition, adding AAPL shares in the most recent quarter, according to Berkshire's13-F filing.Morgan Stanley has raised its target price on AAPL stock to $154. UBS says Apple shares are worth $138. So the analysts are on board too.But $189?How Can Apple Hit $1 Trillion?If Apple traded at $189 per share without any of its financials changing, that would assume a P/E that has climbed to about 22 times earnings. That higher multiple would have to reflect investor expectations that iPhone 7 sales are growing, though more likely, that the iPhone 8 will be a smash hit.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017That's plausible, considering the woes ofSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, not to mention strong first-quarter iPhone sales.Another way to look at it is through the revenue lens.Looking ahead, Apple projects second-quarter revenue of between $51.5 billion-$53.5 billion and gross margin in the range of 38%-39%. The $1 trillion market cap would value the stock at 4 times sales, up from 3.3 times. And it seems unlikely that investors would trade Apple to those kinds of multiples without anything else happening.Apple needs iPhone sales to grow more than the 5% year-over-year figure last quarter. It certainly needs iPads to reverse a 19% YOY drop in revenue. Services, though, is a huge bright spot, growing revenue from 18% YOY, and the segment is accelerating to become a bigger piece of the revenue pie. Continuing that track would certainly help AAPL's chances.iPhone 8 ReleaseThe biggest continuous headline this year is Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone release, believed to be called either the iPhone 8 or theiPhone X.Currently, while the market is optimistic about AAPL stock, it's not pricing in the potential for double-digit revenue growth in iPhone sales on the back of iPhone 8. That would also include reversing the iPhone's slowing sales in China.Anything's possible in China right now, though.Xiaomi was the leader in Chinese smartphone market share in China in Q1 of 2015. In 2016, Huawei and Oppo took the first and second spot, respectively, in China. Apple's position dropped sharply to thefifth spot. However, cutting prices of the iPhone 7 and promoting that particular model in the region could help AAPL compete more effectively.Another Note About ValuationEven if Apple doesn't blow the doors off with iPhone 8 sales, the market isn't against rewarding gigantic tech titans without them boasting breakneck growth.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a P/E of 30 and P/S of 6. P/E and 6x sales (price/sales). Still, Microsoft is expected to grow earnings by about 7% compared to Apple's 7.6% expected growth this year, and next year the disparity expands, with analysts projecting 13.5% profit growth from Apple but just 9.4% from Microsoft.Speaking of corporate software titans, Apple has partnered withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) to develop corporate software. In time, Apple will generate more meaningful revenue from this space.Bottom LineLastly, we'll discuss Apple's giant war chest. AAPL has $246 billion in cash, or around $30 a share in net cash. Assuming a 15% repatriation tax (which in theory could go away with aTrump repatriation tax holiday), AAPL will have $23 per share in cash.This is the company's buyback activity last quarter:""We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares.""Apple currently yields a modest 1.7%. Combined with regular buybacks and debt reduction, AAPL stock holders are getting plenty of value out of Apple's cash as it is.The Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its EndI expect Apple to continue moving higher for all of the above reasons, especially if the broader market continues to melt higher.A lot needs to happen for AAPL stock to gain 40% and reach a trillion dollars in market cap, especially within the next year, but a blowout iPhone 8 release could very well get it done.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

United Rentals, Inc. (URI) Stock Is a Donald Trump Buy;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofUnited Rentals, Inc.(NYSE:URI) are higher by about 20% so far in 2017, and a cool 70% higher since November's election. However, over the past five weeks or so, URI stock has largely trotted sideways - but it has done so in a manner that, through the lens of technical analysis, puts the odds in favor of another leg higher in the not-too-distant future.makeArticleAd();United Rentals is in the business of equipment rental such as forklifts, trucks, diggers for construction of many varieties. That puts URI straight in the crosshairs of the new administration.One of the focal points of President Donald Trump since he's been in office, and in fact since he's been on the campaign trail, has been the ""rebuilding of America"" - specifically as it relates to infrastructure. The promise of spending on the rebuilding of bridges, airports and much more is primarily looked at in two ways:Supporters of the ""plan"" argue that not only is this rebuilding necessary but that it would also bring about a wave of new jobs, which in turn would lead to more economic prosperity.Skeptics of the infrastructure spending point to the financing side of the equation, which would result in a heap of new debt and thus likely difficulty to balance the budget any time soon.I can only say what I think, which is viewed through the lens of probable price action. When it comes to URI stock and other infrastructure plays, while shares have already done heavy lifting in recent months, the path of least resistance remains higher.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Let's look at the charts.URI Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after bottoming out in early 2016 along with the broader stock market, United Rentals has continually pushed higher.Click to EnlargeFollowing the November election results, URI stock began a steep rally that, earlier this year, ultimately led to a breakout above its 2014 highs and into uncharted territory.Last November, URI also broke past the purple dotted diagonal line of resistance that had been firmly in place since 2014. As a result of this multimonth rally, we also note that the 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow, blue and red lines, respectively) also have begun to curl higher in a more meaningful way.In late January, URI stock gapped higher following its latest earnings results, but then quickly began a multiweek sideways move.Click to EnlargeUnited Rentals has largely been rangebound in recent weeks between $122 on the lower end and $130 on the upper end.Last week, URI announced it was raising more debt in part to finance an acquisition. The company is offering $250 million worth of its 5.875% senior notes due 2026.Elon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe stock dipped for exactly one day before buyers stepped back in, pushing the stock back to the upper end of this trading range.From here, if URI stock can push and hold above the $130 mark, the next upside target lies closer to the $140 area.

Make No Mistake: Tesla Inc Looks To Be Winding Down SolarCity's Ambitious Plans;2/28/2017;"WhenTesla Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion late in 2016, a   lot of people (including myself) called the deal a bailout of Elon Musk's high-profile solar   company. The deal didn't seem to do anything to advance Tesla's   electric vehicle (EV) business, it will be a drain on cash, and   it was a huge distraction given the business-model change and   manufacturing expansion SolarCity had undertaken.Fourth-quarter results from Tesla released after the market   closed on Wednesday didn't do a lot to change the narrative that   SolarCity and Tesla are still a strange fit together. In fact, it   could be argued that Tesla is winding down some of SolarCity's   business. Here's how to look at Tesla's solar results last   quarter.Tesla's solar roof is under development at the same time     SolarCity's business is shrinking. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The shrinking solar ambitions of TeslaSolarCity has been reducing its installation guidance for a   year now, so it shouldn't be shocking that Tesla's results fell   way short of expectations. At the start of 2016, SolarCity   expected to install 1,250 MW of solar in 2016. By the end of the   third quarter, the company had reduced guidance to 900 MW,   implying about 300 MW of installations in the fourth quarter.In reality, SolarCity and Tesla installed 201 MW in the fourth   quarter and hit just 803 MW of installations for 2016. This is an   incredibly disappointing result and the fourth quarter is   traditionally a peak for the company as people try to get   year-end tax incentives.The move to sales from leases is good, right?Tesla touted the $77 million in cash generated during the   final six weeks of the year and the sale of 28% of solar systems,   rather than capital-intensive leases. And on the surface both   look good, but that may not be the case.The cash generation includes tax equity funds being raised   that will be lumpy from quarter to quarter, so it isn't as if you   can extrapolate $77 million in cash generated during those six   weeks into a cash flow projection for the year. In fact,   management said on the conference call that SolarCity's leasing   business would hopefully have no impact on its cash position this   year.What's more concerning is that the energy generation and   storage line item on the income statement showed just $3.6   million in gross margin for the quarter to $131.4 million in   revenue, or a 2.7% gross margin. By comparison, SolarCity   generated a 35.7% gross margin for the third quarter of 2016.   This could tell us that slow sales didn't offset higher costs,   energy storage margins are low or negative, or that solar system   sales are incredibly low margin. No matter what the cause, a   margin that bad can't be good.The move to sales will also come with more competition. A   customer may be more likely to shop around to find the best price   if Tesla is selling systems for cash, which will likely lead to   lower margins.Remember that SolarCity came with over $1 billion in run rate   annual operating expenses, which have to be paid for with the   gross profits from running the business. If profit margins are   terrible, it could lead to the solar business being a cash sink   for Tesla long-term.Is SolarCity's installation arm in trouble?Tesla is talking a lot about turning the solar business into a   more sales-focused business and getting away from leases (more of   a necessity than a choice, in reality). If Tesla is going to move   to a more opportunistic sales model through its retail stores, it   would make more sense to contract installation through local   contractors that will be the boots on the ground, leaving Tesla   to act as a sales and engineering company. This isn't uncommon,   like whenHome DepotorLowe'ssell a kitchen setup orToll Brothersbuilds a house, they use local companies to do the actual   work.But that could entail Tesla laying off thousands of installers   and salespeople who were once at the heart of the business. But   it looks like that's what Tesla is setting up to do, and when you   look at the $1 billion in operating costs, it's the thousands of   workers that SolarCity had on the payroll that add a ton of risk   to Tesla's operations.Tesla hasn't made any announcements yet, but with the scaling   back of solar ambitions and the move to start selling solar   systems through Tesla stores, it would make sense to jettison the   installation arm. And the slowdown in installations last quarter   may be in anticipation of the change.Powerwall. Image source: Tesla.What is Tesla doing with solar manufacturing?Musk and Co. talked a lot about solar manufacturing on   Wednesday and dubbed the Buffalo solar plant Gigafactory 2. Time   will tell if Tesla will be able to make solar panels   cost-effectively, but even if it can, the low output and   potential transition of installations might be a problem for the   plant.When the state of New York gave SolarCity a$750 million subsidy to build the Buffalo   plant, it came with a requirement to ""employ 1,460 high-tech jobs for   the manufacturing operation"" as well as ""employ at least 2,000   other personnel in the State of New York to support downstream   solar panel sales and installation for five years."" This is on   top of 1,440 support and contractor jobs that SolarCity was   supposed to indirectly provide. Tesla may have a hard time   hitting that commitment if it scales back on its installation   fleet.On a more fundamental level, Tesla's move into solar   manufacturing is confusing and disappointing. I don't know why   the company would want to be in the highly competitive solar   manufacturing business, where dozens of companies have gone   bankrupt. And the company's Silevo acquisition, which drove the   move into manufacturing, happened in June of 2014, and we still   haven't seen any sort of manufacturing at scale. There are   promises that the second half of the year will see solar panels   with Panasonic technology start rolling out along with the solar   roof, but until we see product, spec sheets, and pricing,   investors should be skeptical.Tesla isn't making a big bet on solarWith all of these factors considered, it's safe to say that   Tesla is scaling back SolarCity's solar growth ambitions and may   even be shrinking the business altogether. And long-term, that   might be the right move given the tough economics in residential   solar.Investors should keep an eye on the transition Tesla is making   to more cash solar sales and solar at retail stores to see how   strong the investment in solar really is -- and what the returns   are. It may just be a bolt-on product made to make electric cars   look cooler, which may not be the worst thing at the end of the   day, all things considered.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Forget Goldman and Go Long Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter a fast start to 2017,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced a sharp U-turn. In our estimation, however, it may be time to buckle up and take a test drive in TSLA stock using a modified spread that will keep investors safer than the competition can. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();It almost appeared TSLA stock knew how to do just one thing this year: drag the Tesla shorts higher and higher, as shares powered forward by nearly 26% in under two months at last week's highs.Tesla's strong rally came despite the company having its share of insults and threats. From cash burn, worries of another secondary, increased risk under a less-subsidy friendly Trump administration and auto competitors gaining traction in the EV car market, investors ignored or shook off a good deal of potentially bearish catalysts.Then came earnings; TSLA stock skidded lower by roughly 6.5% in the report's immediate aftermath. A wider-than-expected loss of 69 cents per share, surprise departure by Tesla's CFO and failure to ramp up deliverables guidance all contributed to investors' less carefree outlook.Building over the past couple sessions despite assurances by management, there's also increased speculation Tesla will delay its Model 3 rollout. The much-anticipated launch is supposed to challengeGeneral Motors Company's(NYSE:GM) electric vehicle Chevy Bolt, which was recently named""Car of the Year""at the Detroit Auto Show.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightNow, there's also Goldman Sachs'downgrade of TSLA stock.The investment bank cut shares to 'sell' from 'neutral,' citing most all the negatives already outlined and estimates Tesla has skewed risk to the downside. Having said that, Goldman isn't always spot-on when it comes totimely recommendationson TSLA stock.Tesla Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeSo is it time to apply the brakes to Tesla's bump in the road or take a backseat behind Goldman?As the weekly chart of TSLA stock shows, shares have entered an area of potential technical support and offer a lower-risk spot to buy shares. However, there are no guarantees when it comes to buying stock and exiting gracefully.Currently, Tesla has seen a common corrective move of 16% that's testing the 38% retracement level, as well as a couple support lines I've drawn on the price chart. The pullback looks more meaningful as it's also challenging the recent key breakout point on the weekly chart, which I wrote about back onJan. 11.Less favorable, the stochastic indicator isn't confirming a bottom and has just turned lower from an overbought condition. The lack of support, though, isn't entirely surprising given the sturdy price run before earnings and quick decline. Yet, it is still viewed as a modest negative for buying into Tesla stock with greater conviction.TSLA Stock Modified Bullish Condor SpreadGiven what's been said and the situation surrounding Tesla since earnings, I don't mind giving away some out-of-the-money upside potential to help reduce the risk associated with paying for a limited-risk spread. My view is that Tesla can rally from here, but new highs in the near-term would likely prove challenging. At the same time, I want to cover my ""you know what"" in the event Tesla stock fails to hold support on the price chart.One modified spread that fits these parameters nicely is the April $250/$260/$270/$275 call condor. With shares at $246.23, the packaged $10 bull call spread and tighter $5 bear vertical costs around $2.70.The breakeven at April expiration is $252.70 and requires TSLA to be modestly higher by about 2.6%. Above $260 and all the way up to $270, the max profit from the bull vertical translates into a profit of $7.30. Below $250, the entire debit will be forfeited.Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back NorthFrom $270 to $275 the smaller $5 bear spread begins to eat into those gains dollar-for-dollar, but ultimately would leave this trader with $2.30 in net profits above $275 in Tesla stock.Bottom line, the imposed limitation on upside is squarely in TSLA stock's pre-earnings and more euphoric price action. And in our view, it's a nice trade-off for helping reduce downside risk during the life of this spread.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) is among several oil stocks having a difficult time in 2017. The price of oil has moved up and down as investors try to discern demand for oil against the supply that energy producers bring to market. Presently, there appears to be plenty of supply, and this is depressing prices - including in BP stock, which is off 9% this year.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrOil prices have recently rallied to nearly $55 per barrel. A recent report detailed that the inventory of crude oil in the U.S. dropped to 512.7 million barrels, and OPEC, the large international oil cartel that essentially controls the overall level of oil and gas production in the world, is trying to reduce supply.Unfortunately, both oil and natural gas prices remain depressed. Oil is a far cry from the $100 per barrel it traded at just a couple of years ago. At a current price nearly half that high, the largest players in the industry - such as BP stock - are struggling to turn a profit and generate enough cash flow to sustain paying dividends while continuing to explore for even more oil.The key problem with investing in oil and gas stocks is the difficulty in predicting where oil prices are heading. This uncertainty has hit the share prices of the industry's largest companies. I have been covering industry giantExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) insome detaillately and have found that its high dividend yield is great consolation as management comes to terms with the fact that oil and gas prices are depressed, and are likely to remain low for some time.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsExxon's current dividend yield is 3.68%, and XOM stock is hovering close to its low point over the past year. But, since we're getting paid to wait, why not gun for a competitor with an even higher yield?BP is a competing energy giant with a current dividend yield of 7.06%. Shares are also bumping against 52-week lows, and BP stock trades at a reasonable forward P/E near 15x.In contrast, Exxon stock trades closer to 19 times earnings estimates for this year.BP Has a Cash Flow ProblemBP's predicament is similar to Exxon's, in that it's currently spending more than it makes. Back in February, management reported 2016 results. Operating cash flow was $10.7 billion, but the company spent $16.7 billion to explore for and produce oil and gas (the upstream business), as well as refine it into chemicals and related commodities (the downstream business).Further, BP sold assets and businesses to bring in approximately $2.6 billion, but still didn't generate enough cash to support its shareholder dividend. Last year, it paid out $4.7 billion in dividends, which was well below the $6.7 billion paid in 2015.Management plans to continue straightening out the company's finances this year. BP plans to cut capex to nearly $16 billion and expects to raise as much as $5.5 billion by selling more assets and businesses.However, the company still has to pay out billions related to the Deepwater Horizon debacle in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2017, the payouts should range between $4.5 billion-$5.5 billion.For investors concerned about BP's cash flow predicament, consider that the company can likely ride out any extended period of low oil and gas prices. Sales this year should exceed $233 billion, and the company boasts total assets north of $263 billion. BP's bonds are investment grade, and there's always the chance that energy commodity prices will rally.Bottom Line on BP StockFor the price of BP stock to rally from current levels, the sooner cash flow breaks even, the better. There could also be positive developments on the Deepwater Horizon front, including additional settlements or reductions in future payments.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA)Of course, if oil prices do rally above $60, BP stock will move upward in sympathy. Few strategists expect this to happen any time soon, but very few predicted oil would drop precipitously from $100 in late 2014 and bottom out at close to $30 per barrel in early 2016.A basket approach, or investing in a handful of the largest energy players in the world, makes sense in today's environment. Exxon still has a reputation as one of the best capital allocators. BP is also up there, and though its oil spill liabilities remain a huge headache, it still has the financial strength to support one of the highest dividend yields in the industry.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBoeing Co (BA) Stock Is Soaring on Trump's CoattailsTarget Corporation (TGT) Stock Is Even Worse Than Q4 Earnings Suggest7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postBP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Is Soaring on Trump’s Coattails;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince the November election,Boeing Co(NYSE:BA) is up 26%. The earnings don't justify the bullishness in BA stock. The December quarter numbers, released Jan. 25, showed less revenue than in the previous quarter, and lower earnings, mainly because military orders were down.makeArticleAd();Source:WikimediaFinancial analysts may claim that a 30% hike in Boeing's dividend and an increase in the company's stock buyback program,announced in December, justify a much higher price for Boeing stock. Bulls will also point to a rosy outlook from CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who expects earnings of approximately $9.30 per share this year, a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19, close to that of the market.But, the timing of the march in BA stock - it is up 10% since those earnings came out - point to a different cause for its rise: Donald Trump.Trump's Favorite ManufacturerMuilenburg and Trump have developed something of a bromance since January. Muilenburg hasechoed the Trump line on tax reform, and Trump has put his thumb on the scale for Boeing's F/A 18 Hornet fighter jet.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightTrump also attended the roll-out of Boeing's latest commercial jet, which the company considered a very big deal. It seems ""Trumponomics"" will make or break Boeing.Boeing is also in line with Trump foreign policy.As Trump turns to India, a counterweight to Chinese power in Asia, Boeing is dramatically increasing its activity there, creating a new defense business unit, hinting at an acquisition spree,integrating with that country's supply chain.Trump likes England post-Brexit, soBoeing likes England post-Brexit. Trump likes South Carolina,Boeing loves South Carolina.Presidents serve four-year terms, and getting in line with each new President's priorities makes sense for any military contractor. BA Stock just represents an extreme case.Do the Numbers Add Up?There are financial arguments to be made both ways on Boeing, which is whyInvestorPlace'sSam Collins recently called BA stock his ""trade of the day""while Vince Martin wrote, just one week earlier, thatthe Boeing stock rally was out of gas.Boeing's asset base has fallen in recent years, from nearly $95 billion to less than $90 billion, while the long-term debt load on those assets has increased by nearly $1 billion. Boeing's revenue peaked in 2015, falling last year by approximately $500 million, with earnings per share rising only because buybacks cut the float from 695 million shares to 642.8 million.But, you don't buy or sell stocks based on yesterday - you buy or sell them based on tomorrow. You can argue that tomorrow looks very good for Boeing stock, with increased nationalism leading to more military orders, the increased efficiency of new jets leading to more domestic orders, and the increased support of the Trump Administration leading to more profit.Boeing also faces a growing, albeit competitive market in outer space, where it hopes toautomate the production of satellitesand compete with start-ups likeSpaceX, with shorter production cycles.Should You Buy BA Stock?Analysts are divided on Boeing stock, with10 calling it a buy and 9 calling it a hold, while 3 now call it a sell.My own view is that, while the upside on BA stock may be limited - even our own Sam Collins is just looking for a 10% bump to $200 from here - income investors should be very interested, as the new dividend of $1.42 per share is a 3.21% yield at current prices.Leave Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock to the SavagesWhat you think of Boeing, in other words, depends less on what you think of Trump than what you want for yourself. If you are looking for big growth, look elsewhere, but if you need retirement income, Boeing stock looks like a good bet (at least for the next four years).Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Why Tesla's Model 3 Production Plans Could Go Awry;2/28/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gearing up to put its first true mass-market   product, the Model 3 sedan, into production. If all goes well,   the first production Model 3s will roll down a brand-new assembly   line in July.It's a huge step for the Silicon Valley automaker. The Model 3   will be produced in much higher volumes than anything that Tesla   has tried to build so far. And because it's a mass-market   product, the quality expectations will be extraordinarily   high.We know that Tesla has been spending heavily on an elaborate   revamp of its Fremont, California factory as it gears up to put   the Model 3 into production. Last week, CEO Elon Musk gave us a   look into how the company plans to ramp up its production   line.makeArticleAd();Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last     year. Image source: Tesla.A gradual ramp-up through the first three months of   production""I feel pretty confident that we should get there by the end   of this year, to 5,000 a week,"" Musk told analysts during Tesla's   fourth-quarter earnings call. Musk went on to outline the   production schedule that Tesla has given its parts suppliers:1,000 per week in July;2,000 per week in August;4,000 per week in September;5,000 per week by the end of the year.Keep in mind that that schedule is for parts deliveries to   Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. As Musk pointed out, it   will take time to turn those parts into finished cars as Tesla   works to get its brand-new assembly line running -- and it'll   take more time to deliver those cars to customers.The ""term-paper problem"" that could throw off the   scheduleBut even factoring in those assumptions, Musk warned that the   Model 3 ramp-up could be slowed further by what he called the   ""term-paper problem"":I was a teaching assistant in college, and no matter what     date we set the exam paper for, when the term paper was due,     it's always like there are people that are late. It's just the     way it goes. People are sometimes -- and I'm guilty of this too     -- too optimistic about the timing, or they get unlucky.Tesla has set strict delivery dates with its suppliers, but   Musk said that he knows that some number of them might well be   late. Even if it's just 1%, those late parts could throw a big   wrench into Tesla's ambitious production ramp-up schedule. Tesla   would either have to wait for the supplier to deliver the parts,   pay (a lot) extra for a rush order from another supplier, or try   to make the parts itself, in-house. Any solution other than   waiting for the original supplier risks introducing quality   concerns -- something that Teslareally can't afford with the Model 3.So does Tesla stand a chance of making its numbers?It does stand a chance of making its numbers. But it's   important to remember that there's a whole lot that can go wrong,   and some of that probably will.Like any automaker, Tesla depends on hundreds of different   suppliers for thousands of different parts. Things happen:   Sometimes, the first batches of parts for a brand-new model don't   fit exactly right. Specifications and tooling are adjusted, and   the supplier sends a better-fitting batch -- but that takes   time.The production line for Tesla's Model 3 will have much more     automation than its current lines, Musk said. Image source:     Daniel Sparks/The Motley Fool.Remember also that Tesla's production line for the Model 3   will be brand-new, and it will incorporate much more automation   than Tesla's existing line for the Model S and Model X. That   presents more opportunities for snags that might cost a day or   two here or there, all of which can add up.Most of this will probably be sorted out before Tesla   officially begins production of Model 3s for delivery to   customers. But ""most"" isn't all, and Tesla's investors -- and   customers -- will probably need to be patient as the company   works through the process.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Rio Tinto, Dillard's, Tesla and Goldman Sachs highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/28/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 28, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsRio Tinto(NYSE:RIO-Free Report)as the Bull of the DayDillard's Inc. (NYSE:DDS-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)andGoldman Sachs(NYSE:GS-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Rio Tinto(NYSE:RIO-Free Report)is a global industrial metal & mineral mining conglomerate headquartered in London. They employ about 55,000 people in more than 40 countries across six continents.The miner has strong presence in Australia and North America, and significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America. They have five product groups - Aluminum, Copper & Diamonds, Energy & Minerals, Iron Ore and Growth & Innovation.They have benefited immensely from the recent rebound in commodity prices. Additionally, the mining giant has also taken a number of measures of late to improve productivity, which have started bearing fruit now.Impressive ResultsThe miner returned to profitability last year. Earnings grew 12% in 2016, thanks mainly to the recovery in commodity prices and cost cutting. They generated strong operating cash flow of $8.5 billion and underlying earnings of $5.1 billion.Consolidated sales for 2016 were $33.8 billion, down from $34.8 billion a year ago. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower average commodity prices and reduced market premium for aluminum.Returning Capital to ShareholdersWith solid results, they announced a much higher-than-expected dividend to $1.70 per share and a $500 million of share buyback plan. During 2016, they returned $3.6 billion to shareholders, representing about 70% of underlying earnings.Rising EstimatesEstimates have surged after results, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY 2017 is now $4.95 per share, up from $3.75 per share, before the results.Bear of the Day:It has been a very challenging environment for mall based retailers due to declining traffic, rising trend for online shopping and increasing competition from off-price fashion chains. Of late, concerns regarding the impact of border adjustment tax on retailers are also making investors nervous.Founded in 1938,Dillard's Inc. (NYSE:DDS-Free Report)is a large departmental store chain featuring fashion apparel, cosmetics and home furnishings. The company went public in 1969 and it currently operated about 300 stores across 29 states. Their merchandise includes both national and exclusive brands.Disappointing ResultsThe retailer reported disappointing results for Q4, with both sales and earnings missing estimates and also declining year over year.Adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share were significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 and down about 17.8% year-over-year.""Our operating results reflect another quarter of mall traffic declines from continued retail industry challenges,"" said the CEO.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have been cutting their estimates for the company after quarterly results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year are now $4.36 per share and $4.17 per share respectively, down from $5.00 per share and $4.77 per share respectively, before the results. Declining estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank # 5 last week.The company has missed Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the last four quarters, with an average quarterly surprise of 5.4%.The Bottom LineDeclining store traffic and rising trend towards online shopping to present challenges for retailers. The Zacks industry rank for Retail-Regional Department Stores is currently 251 out of 265 (Bottom 5%).There is no Zacks Rank #1 or #2 stock in this industry as of now.More Stocks to Sell. Now.Beyond our Bear Stock of the Day, today's list of 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand even more urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. Many appear to be sound investments but, since 1988, such stocks have actually performed more than 11X worse than the S&P 500.Additional content:Here's Why Shares of Tesla (TSLA) Tumbled MondayOn Monday, shares of storied electric car makerTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)are tumbling, down around 4.5% in morning trading to $245.42 per share after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS-Free Report) downgraded the automaker's stock. Analyst David Tamberrino turned negative, cutting TSLA to Sell from Neutral and slashing his six-month price target to $185 from $190.""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM (original-equipment market) peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs,"" Tamberrino said in a note to clients.Goldman is already expecting Tesla's launch of its low-cost, mass-market Model 3 to be delayed, despite reassurance from the company in its earnings report last week that the vehicle is on schedule to arrive in July. The firm also believes Tesla will be forced to issue $1.7 billion in shares in the upcoming third quarter to fund its capital-spending plans.The electric car maker's fourth quarter earnings were mixed, with strong revenues despite a significant net loss. It was a fairly normal report for Tesla, filled with inconsistencies and ambitious goals made by CEO Elon Musk.

Go Long United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) Stock;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTransportation stocks - as represented by theiShares Dow Jones Transport. Avg. (ETF)(NYSEARCA:IYT) - have rallied about 1.6% between last Friday and yesterday, Monday, Feb. 27. This might not seem like much, but it does matter when considering the fates of transport stockUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS).makeArticleAd();Yes, 1.6% isn't much in percentage terms. However, considering the relative weakness which this group of stocks exhibited versus the broader stock market, this new-found friskiness is a welcome change and could in the near-term lead to higher prices still.UPS stock, at about 6.8% currently, is the fourth largest holding of the IYT ETF. Since its late-January earnings report, UPS has badly lagged the broader group of transportation stocks as represented on the first chart.Click to EnlargeNote the steep relative underperformance since the relative strength high in the summer of 2016. While through this lens, this relative weakness still looks to be in free fall, let's also note that this ratio chart is once again reaching the relative weakness lows from March 2015 as denoted by the two orange bubbles.While this alone is a far cry from a bullish signal, let's keep this chart in mind as we work through the rest of the analysis below.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowWhen I last discussed UPS stock onNov. 8, 2016- the day prior to the U.S. election results - I offered that the stock looked promising for a rally once we got the initial post-election price reaction out of the way. Sure enough, the stock held up after the election results and hit my price target (in the $115-$116 range) a few short weeks later.UPS Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after topping out in mid-December, UPS stock began a corrective phase that measured nearly 15% at the Jan. 31 lows following the earnings report.Click to EnlargeOn this chart, we see that the area around $104-$105 (the January lows) matches up with horizontal support, as represented by the blue box and the 100-week simple moving average (also blue).On the daily chart, we see that these January lows - which on Friday, Feb. 24, received a marginal retest - also lined up with the black diagonal line of former resistance that could now turn into support.Click to EnlargeFrom a momentum perspective, note that the MACD oscillator in recent weeks became very oversold and is now showing signs of potential recovery.Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back NorthLastly, on Monday, Feb. 27, my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator flashed a swing trading buy signal as represented  by the green up-arrow. This buy signal is occurring at a key technical confluence support area and follows last Friday's bullish engulfing day.Active investors could consider taking a long-side stab at UPS stock here using the $104.80 area as a stop loss and targeting the $110 are as a first upside price target.Like what you see?

Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back North;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) initially rose after hours following an earnings report that raised as many questions as it answered. However, TSLA stock then succumbed to selling pressures and ultimately fell some 7% across the week.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)AGoldman Sachs downgradeyesterday added another 5% to the recent slide to close at $246.23, with shares of Tesla stock now 12% off the recent highs at the $280 level.With the faith in TSLA stock now broken, the $235 level looms as an important area to hold.Certainly the ongoing questions surrounding Tesla continue to remain unanswered. The most pertinent question involves the likelihood of an additional capital raise for Tesla, especially on the heels of theSolarCityacquisition and the ever alarming free cash flow burn rate. While TSLA appears to have more than adequate liquidity in the short-term, eventually, a dilutive secondary offering appears to be almost virtually certain.Tesla also faces uncertainty surrounding the critical Model 3 launch. Yes, Tesla management is fully confident of their projections … but many analysts are expressing doubts. Certainly, TSLA's past history of Tesla - over-promising and under-delivering - likely weighed on analyst opinion. James Brumley does a superb job ofdrilling down deeplyon some of these very notions.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowWhile faith in Tesla may be difficult to gauge, it is not all that difficult to see from a technical perspective.Tesla Stock ChartsIn my most recent post on TSLA stock, I pointed to an over-abundance of faith in the company at the $270 level and suggested a short-term bearish trade, which proved to be prescient. With shares now approaching the $235 support level, my view on Tesla is decidedly less bearish.Why? Because pricedoesmatter.Click to EnlargeUsing a somewhat simplistic 9-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) methodology has proven to be quite effective in identifying short-term tops and bottoms in Tesla stock. Overbought levels in blue correspond to tops in the stocks and oversold areas in red are indicative of short-term lows, as seen in the chart above.With a current RSI reading of just 32, TSLA is fast approaching an oversold level.Click to EnlargeTSLA stock also bounced off the 50-day moving average at $241, reversing the downtrend and closing well off the lows. This type of reversal many times bodes well in the short run, especially with intermediate support looming at the $235 area.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Going to Stumble SoonSo while I'm decidedly not a Tesla bull for a long-term investment, as a trader, I've switched to a more bullish short-term posture given the recent drubbing in shares. To position for a bounce - or at worst, a consolidation - a bull put spread makes sense.How to Trade TSLA Stock HereBuy March $227.50 puts and sell March $230 puts for a 50 cents net credit.These are the traditional monthly options on TSLA stock that expire March 17. The maximum gain is $50 per spread with maximum risk of $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%.The short $230 strike provides a 6.5% downside cushion to the $246.23 closing price of Tesla shares and is also well below the $235 support level.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock or Twilio Inc (TWLO): Which Is a Better Buy?The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postPlay Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back Northappeared first onInvestorPlace."

It's Official: These Are the 3 Most Ludicrously Overvalued Stocks on the Market;2/28/2017;"The stock market is, for lack of a better word, imperfect.   While we as investors would love for things to be entirely   rational (for example, earnings growth translating into orderly   stock-buying and the subsequent appreciation of stock   valuations), that's not always what happens.A number of factors, including emotions and even X factors   that can't be foreseen ahead of time, can influence stock   valuations. Sometimes these ancillary factors can push stock   valuations exceptionally low, which presents an intriguing buying   opportunity for Wall Street and investors. On the other side of   the coin, emotions and X factors can also push stock valuations   into the stratosphere, well beyond the point where any rational   fundamental theorist would dare go. At any given time, there are   almost always going to be a few stocks that fall into the latter   category of being ludicrously overvalued.Three companies that'll have fundamental investors saying     ""No thanks!"" Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Though valuation is an entirely arbitrary process for each   investor, the following three companies stand out for their   frightening valuations compared to what they bring to the   table.Tesla Inc.It may not be a popular opinion, but one stock I'd crown as   overvalued -- ludicrously so -- is electric-vehicle and   solar-panel-installation companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .What I will give Tesla is this: It's the first car company in   decades to really build itself from the ground up and disrupt   Detroit's big three automakers. The demand for Tesla's Model S   and X, as well as initial orders for its cheaper Model 3 sedan,   have been phenomenal and demonstrate the desire of Americans to   own cleaner vehicles.But what looks to be a good idea on paper has yet to translate   into profits. Just days ago Tesla reported a 79% increase in   automotive fourth-quarter revenue, but it still delivered an   adjusted net loss of $106.6 million. Sure, that was a 60%   narrower adjusted net loss from the prior-year quarter, but it's   still a loss. In fact, the company burned through more than $448   million in cash flow during Q4 as it continued to ramp up the   Gigafactory in preparation for the Model 3. Tesla ended the year   with $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents, but has plans to   spend $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2017.   In other words, yet another cash raise may be in order.The Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla Inc.Tesla's solar business -- it acquired SolarCity less than two   months ago -- also languished. Tesla reported 201 MW of solar   installation in Q4, which was almost 100 MW lower than what   SolarCity had previously guided for. It's no secret that solar   has been weak, but these figures are exceptionally weak.A simple comparison ofGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) and Tesla really shows how out in left field Tesla's   valuation is at the moment. In 2016, General Motors sold nearly   10 million vehicles and generated nearly $9.12 billion in profit.   In fact, it's currently valued at roughly six times its trailing   12-month earnings. By comparison, Tesla produced only around   90,000 vehicles and is losing money hand over fist, and its $41   billion valuation implies a market value of almost $500,000 per   car! GM's $56 billion valuation and annual production of 10   million implies a valuation of approximately $5,600 per car   produced. That difference is insane. Even with the two companies   having very different business models, I don't see why any   fundamental investors in their right minds would choose Tesla   over GM.Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.Just because a stock has a small-cap valuation doesn't mean it   can't still be ludicrously overvalued. Next on the list is highly   volatile developmental-stage mining companyNorthern Dynasty Minerals(NYSEMKT: NAK) .In recent months, Northern Dynasty Minerals' shares have   caught fire with the expectation that the Trump administration   would ease rules set in place by the Environment Protection   Agency, possibly allowing the company to be permitted for the   Pebble Project in Alaska. In theory, Pebble has enough assets in   the ground to keep a mining company busy for upwards of 100   years. Gold andsilver   pricesare also up nicely over the past two months.Image source: Getty Images.Unfortunately, Northern Dynasty's dream of development seems   to be more of a fairy tale. One of the bigger issues with Pebble   is that the inferred assets in the ground are spread out. While   abundant, many of these assets just haven't appeared to be   economically feasible to recover. What's more, Northern Dynasty   has already spent hundreds of millions just to get to the point   where it's trying to determine if there are economically viable   areas to mine in Pebble. Don't believe me? Here's a direct   statement from the company's third-quarter report:The Group's continuing operations and underlying value and     recoverability of the amount shown for the Group's mineral     property interests, is entirely dependent upon the existence of     economically recoverable mineral reserves.Making matters worse, Northern Dynasty Minerals has nowhere   near the capitalization required to develop Pebble into a   commercially viable operation (assuming recovery is even   economically feasible). At the end of the third quarter, the   company had less than $6 million in cash and cash equivalents   left, although it did generate more than $32 million from a   secondary offering in January 2017. Even so, this is laughably   far off from the years and billions of dollars it would seemingly   take to get Pebble up to commercial production.Having been previously abandoned before by companies with   pocketbooks that were far deeper than Northern Dynasty Minerals',   Pebble is likely a dead duck, and Northern Dynasty's stock is   potentially worthless.Snap Inc.Finally, even though it's not even officially public yet,   Snapchat parentSnap Inc.(NYSE: SNAP) gets my vote for being ludicrously overvalued.On one hand, I can understand the allure of a company like   Snap considering how wellFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) has performed since it went public. In just three   years, Snap has essentially tripled its daily active users from   around 50 million to 158 million, and with the somewhat recent   addition of advertising revenue, Snap's top line is surging. It   generated $404.5 million in sales in 2016 after just $58 million   in revenue in 2015. If Snap can use innovative new ad-targeting   tools to reach a rapidly growing number of users, itcouldbe Facebook 2.0, or so some pundits suggest.Image source: Snap Inc.However, as has been the theme here, I'd like to disagree.   Snap's expected IPO price range, according to the company, values   it as aggressively as $22 billion. At $22 billion, Snap is being   valued at 54.4 times its total sales. I'm going to go ahead and   repeat that for you who are skimming. That's 54 (fifty-four!) times sales. By comparison, Facebook andTwitterare currently valued at 14.2 and 4.5 times sales,   respectively.What's more, companies like Facebook have alternative revenue   channels. Snap only began generating revenue from advertising two   years ago, so it's entirely reliant on ads to generate its   sales.Of course, the coup de grace for Snap is that in spite of   $404.5 million in sales, it wound up losing $514.6 million in   2016. This harks back to the dot-com bubble days, when companies   simply spent every ounce of capital they had and assumed the   economy and internet growth would buffer their risk-taking. At   some point Wall Street is going to again shun companies that   can't turn a profit (ahem, Tesla!), and I certainly wouldn't want   any part of Snap when that day comes.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Big Factor That Will Help Tesla's Model 3 Launch;2/27/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gearing up for maybe its biggest moment yet:   the start of production of its first true mass-market model, the   Model 3.It's a moment that is fraught with challenges. The Model 3 is   all-new and different from earlier Teslas, and it's going to be   built on an all-new assembly line that incorporates much more   automation than anything Tesla has tried to date.A lot rides on Tesla's ability todeliver high-quality Model 3s, and there are a lot of things that could go wrong. But as CEO   Elon Musk explained during Tesla's earnings call last week, Tesla   has an important new factor working in its favor: its   suppliers.makeArticleAd();Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last     year. Image source: Tesla.Tesla is reaping the benefits of its growth with   suppliersAll automakers, big or small, are heavily dependent on   suppliers. In particular, suppliers that specialize in certain   types of parts -- whether circuit boards or seats -- can produce   parts to a higher level of quality much less expensively than an   automaker could do on its own.Musk said that in Tesla's early days, it was hard to get the   attention of the established auto-industry suppliers. Those   suppliers are used to thinking in terms of production runs that   will go into six or seven figures of volume -- and few in the   auto industry thought Tesla's Model S would end up selling in the   tens of thousands every year.But now that Tesla has proven that it can (and will) build and   sell cars in volume, the suppliers are much more interested in   winning its business. Musk explained:We're able to get usually the A team at the A supplier for     Model 3. It's rare that we're not able to get that. Whereas,     particularly for Model S and to some degree for Model X, when     we were trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the     top-tier suppliers wouldn't even work with us. They didn't     believe in the car. They thought we'd go bankrupt.Having shown the results of the Model S and the Model X, the     interest from suppliers went from basically getting like the     worst team on second-tier suppliers to getting the best team on     first-tier suppliers. It's really a big difference.It should make a huge difference in some of the details of the   finished product. Think of things like the fit and finish of   interior panels, or the comfort of the seats, or the quality of   the glass used in the windshield. These are all things that drew   some criticism in the earlier Teslas, and they're all things that   can be improved by having the A-list suppliers giving their best   efforts.If the Model 3's launch is smooth, suppliers will be a big   reasonThere's a lot -- awholelot -- that can go wrong with Tesla's ramp-up to full production   of the Model S. Some things will go wrong: A few suppliers will   be late, a few early batches of parts won't fit properly, a robot   or tool on Tesla's brand-new production line won't work as   designed.These things happen to all automakers. They're more likely to   happen to Tesla with the Model 3, simply because this is the   company's first-ever attempt at a high-volume production car.Analysts have looked to the problem-plagued launch of Tesla's   Model X for clues as to how the Model 3 launch might unfold (and   have downgraded their near-term expectations accordingly). But   the fact that Tesla has been able to significantly upgrade its   relationships with suppliers since the X's launch might make that   a misleading comparison.Long story short: I think the Model 3 launch could go more   smoothly than many expect. If so, suppliers will be a big reason   why.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla, AmTrust Financial Services, and Horizon Pharma Slumped Today;2/27/2017;"The stock market kept performing well on Monday, and theDow Jones Industrialsposted its 12th straight all-time record high. Market sentiment   was sunny following the release of Warren Buffett's annual   shareholder letter over the weekend, and the Oracle of Omaha made   positive comments about the sustainability of the current bull   market, which was able to overcome early declines in the major   market benchmarks. However, some stocks didn't fare as well as   the overall market, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,AmTrust Financial Services(NASDAQ: AFSI) , andHorizon Pharma(NASDAQ: HZNP) were among the worst performers on the day. Below,   we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did   so poorly.Tesla gets a poor reviewShares of Tesla fell 4% after the electric car manufacturer   received a downgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall   Street giant cut its rating on Tesla from neutral to sell, citing   concerns about the company's ability to launch its Model 3   mass-market sedan, execute on the strategy behind its acquisition   of solar specialist SolarCity, and deal with the need to tap the   capital markets to raise cash. Yet even the bearish analysts   admit that Tesla has a competitive advantage over rival   automakers with respect to the technology and architecture of its   electric vehicles, and Tesla's efforts to boost battery   production appear to be working. Nevertheless, the question   facing investors is whether Tesla can execute well on the huge   opportunity it has in front of it, and at least in Goldman's   eyes, that could prove more difficult than initially thought.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();AmTrust deals with a potential problemAmTrust Financial Services' stock plunged 19% in the wake of   the company's fourth-quarter financial report. The insurance   provider said that results for the quarter looked solid, with   substantial rises in premium volume and service and fee income,   as well as a pickup in net income of nearly two-thirds compared   to the year-ago quarter. However, investors appeared nervous   about AmTrust's comments about the timing of its annual report   filing, which included a statement that the company expects to   disclose ""material weaknesses in in its internal control over   financial reporting"" that existed as of the end of 2016. Until   AmTrust reveals exactly how material the impacts might be and how   it expects to fix them going forward, shareholders are likely to   remain cautious.Horizon disappoints investorsFinally, shares of Horizon Pharma fell 6%. The   biopharmaceutical company said that sales were up 27% from   year-ago levels, but it posted a net loss of $130.5 million. Even   after adjusting for various extraordinary items, Horizon's   bottom-line growth was limited to less than 1%, resulting in flat   adjusted earnings per share from the year-earlier period. Yet   even expectations of 19% to 23% top-line growth in 2017 with 12%   to 22% increases in pre-tax operating profit weren't enough to   satisfy shareholders. Nevertheless, Horizon CEO Tim Walbert   remained optimistic, noting that ""continued commercial execution   and the completion of two transformative acquisitions [will]   bolster our rapidly expanding rare disease business.""Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Back on Track?;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGraphics processor makerNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is enjoying a cautious bounce back on Monday after somerare post-earnings unpleasantnessover the past couple weeks. NVDA stock, which soared a massive 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, has been a popular momentum play because of its exposure to exciting and fast-growing areas such as machine learning, virtual reality/augmented reality and autonomous transportation.makeArticleAd();But after reporting better-than-expected results on both its top and bottom lines, as well solid forward guidance, investors had a powerful sell-the-news response in Nvidia stock. Shares pushed below their 50-day moving average for the first time in more than a year.What should investors watch for in NVDA stock now?Looking back at its results, the growth is undeniable: Revenues surged nearly 55% from the year prior thanks to a 66.4% jump in gaming sales to $1.35 billion, responsible for about two-thirds of the company's overall take. The auto segment, which specializes in self-driving systems used byTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) and others, saw revenue grow 37.6% to $128 million.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowBut, if you look hard, there are early signs that expectations could cool. You can see it in the OEM & IP segment, where revenue fell 11.1% to $176 million last quarter. This could be a sign of a slowdown in graphics card sales after the very successful launch of the GTX 1000 series in 2016.Needham analysts believe gaming revenue growth will slow to an 11% annual rate. Stifel is worried that both seasonality and a high revenue base will also limit gaming revenue growth going forward. Valuations have been a concern as well, resulting in a downgrade of NVDA stock at BMO Capital Markets.Technically, double-top resistance near $120 will be difficult to overcome despite Goldman Sachsdefending the stockand suggesting a buy-the-weakness approach.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdgeandEdge Proinvestment advisory newsletters.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Going to Stumble Soon;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rebound inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is one heck of a story. Just one year ago the stock was trading below $2 and appeared to be on the brink of extinction. Then, suddenly, it turned itself around. Now AMD stock has powered through $15 for the first time since 2007.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThis sort of parabolic momentum was commonplace for tech companies back in the late 1990s - AMD experienced similar spikes in 1999-2000 and 2003-05, each followed by a crash in the years ahead - but this is a very rare occurrence in today's environment.AMD stock is up more than 600% in the last year, with new products primarily driving the growth. However, you also have to keep fundamentals in mind, and I believe there is reason to be cautious here.While Advanced Micro Devices is set to once againreport positive earnings in 2017 and even more robust growth in the coming years, there's no question that AMD stock is overvalued.Looking ahead to 2020, the 20 analysts currently covering this stock anticipate earnings will grow to 60 cents per share. A 25X multiple on that expectation would put AMD at $15, which isn't far from where it's trading today. And based on 2017 EPS expectations of 6 cents, the shares currently boast a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 237.AMD Stock ChartsSpeaking from a pure technical standpoint, AMD has been one of the best stocks in the market over the last year with its methodical series of higher highs and higher lows.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowHowever, today the stock is overbought and due for a near-term pullback.If the trend were to continue, AMD stock would pull back and successfully test support around $12.60. On the other hand, a break below that level would compromise the uptrend.As a result, I wouldn't be a buyer at current levels.But if we do see some near-term weakness and a bounce off $12.60, AMD could be a buy around $13 for a purely technical swing trade.Matthew McCall is founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm.

Why Does Honda's Electric Car Have Just 80 Miles of Range?;2/27/2017;"The upcoming battery-electric Clarity sedan fromHonda(NYSE: HMC) will come with a big surprise, according to a new   report: a range of just 80 miles.That's the word from trade publicationAutomotive Newsin a report that was more or less confirmed by Honda   officials.That seems woefully inadequate by 2017 standards. What is   Honda thinking?makeArticleAd();The upcoming Honda Clarity Electric is expected to look very     similar to the 2017 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell sedan released late     last year. Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.Why such a short range?At an expected starting price of around $35,000, the Clarity   Electric will be in direct competition (in terms of price, at   least) withGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt EV andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcoming Model 3 sedan. But the Bolt has an   EPA-rated range of 238 miles, and the Model 3's range is expected   to be in the same ballpark. Why didn't the Clarity's range at   least come close to its rivals?Honda executives told Automotive News that the Clarity   Electric's short range was a byproduct of the company's decision   to base it on the platform of the midsize Clarity Fuel Cell,introduced last year. The Clarity Fuel Cell is a midsize sedan, about the size of   Honda's Accord. It's considerably bigger than the Bolt.The size and design of the Clarity platform, which will also   be shared with a plug-in hybrid version, didn't leave room   (physically or financially) for a larger, longer-range battery   pack without a hefty cost increase, they said.Why Honda committed to a three-Clarity strategyHonda explained last year that the idea behind theClarity's three-drivetrain strategyis that it will give Honda flexibility to vary the production mix   as the market and infrastructure evolves. It also allows Honda's   customers to choose their preferred path to an ""ultra-low carbon   vehicle that meets their lifestyle needs,"" in Honda's words.I think the business decision flow probably looked like   this:After years of building tiny numbers of fuel-cell vehicles     for test markets, Hondawantedto do a fuel-cell car that could be marketed to a somewhat     wider audience.Under pressure from investors (and maybe its dealers),     Honda felt itneededto offer a midsize battery-electric car -- if only to show that     it could be competitive in that realm.Honda thendecidedto add a plug-in hybrid version that was likely to sell in much     greater numbers than either of the other versions, in order to     give the Clarity a better chance of turning a profit.The problem is, when you design one car around three very   different drivetrains, a lot of compromises have to be made. And   the Clarity Electric's rivals are much less compromised   designs.The cost of compromising on a battery-electric carTesla has shown the world what can be done when a car is   designed from the ground up around a battery-electric drivetrain.   A vehicle designed from the start around electric motors and a   big battery pack can have plenty of range, good handling, a roomy   interior, and lots of cargo space.The Chevy Bolt doesn't look like a Tesla, but like the Teslas,   it was designed from the start as a battery-electric vehicle. It   doesn't have the range or speed of the big Teslas, but it has   something else enabled by its battery-electric packaging: A   surprisingly roomy interior enclosed in a small, nimble vehicle   perfect for city driving.It's no coincidence that the Teslas and the Bolt are the   current gold standard of battery-electric vehicles. And it's sad   that Honda, which has spent years building up its green-car   credibility, has settled for a compromised design with the   Clarity Electric.But will it sell?Some folks say range doesn't matter all that much, and the   Clarity Electric will find buyers attracted to its size and   Honda's reputation for quality and durability. I'm skeptical: I   think the plug-in hybrid version of the Clarity -- or an Accord   Hybrid -- is likely to win over most of the green-minded Honda   loyalists who might have taken a chance on a Clarity Electric   with greater range.It's likely Honda will share more details about the Clarity   Electric at the New York International Auto Show in April.

The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of selling the $130 naked put but for the finite risk profile advantage.While 40 cents may sound too little, it would represent an 8% yield on money risked and for the high chance of success it carries it should elate most investors.I chose longer-dated risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations. I find that longer-dated options risk is easier to manage. Also, I can close either of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA);2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) stock is down 9.65% year to date; the company has had a rough start to 2017. First, a $2 billion asset impairment charge on gas assets in the Rocky Mountains clouded XOM's fourth-quarter earnings call on Jan. 31.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Then, on Feb. 22 , XOM announced that it had to write off 3.3 billion barrels of oil in reserves at the end of 2016. With oil prices in the mid $50s, getting oil from some of XOM's Canadian oil sands is no longer profitable.This represents a massive destruction of value for holders of Exxon stock. A decade ago, XOM invested approximately  $20 billion in these Canadian oil sands amid concern over peak oil. Unless oil prices rise, those billions will have been wasted.There could be more such downside surprises in store for Exxon as well. Further developments in clean energy could wipe billions more off the balance sheets of oil companies like XOM.XOM's Rosy View of Oil's FutureUnlikeRoyal Dutch Shell plc (ADR)(NYSE:RDS.A), whose CFO said thatoil demand could peak as soon as 2020, XOM expects oil to dominate past the year 2040 .The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsMcKinsey & Co. expects oil demand topeak by 2030, with electric vehicles representing 30% of new vehicles sold that year. XOM, on the other hand, doesn't see electric vehicles passing 10% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. until 2040 .Could XOM be underestimating the threat of electric cars and alternative energy? A new study by the Carbon Tracker Initiative and Imperial College London suggests that the answer could be yes. This study found that the adoption of electric vehicles could displace2 million barrels of oil per dayin demand by 2025.Oil companies like XOM may be doing straight line extrapolations when the adoption of new technologiesactually follows an S-curve. Initially, progress is slow for many years, as only a few adopt a new technology. Eventually, however, usage of the technology jumps and it goes mainstream before growth tapers off.Advancements in battery technology may be reducing use of gasoline, another form of energy storage. Recently, gasoline consumption in the U.S. plummeted and the country experienced theworst gasoline glut since 1990.Is this temporary, or could this be a sign of oil demand peaking?Tesla's Threat to Oil Companies Like XOMWith its recent acquisition of SolarCity,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is on its way to becoming an alternative energy powerhouse. Tesla brings solar, electric vehicles and energy storage together under one roof (pun intended). TSLA wants to beginsolar roof installationslater this year.Renewable energy depends on energy storage technology in order to compete with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels can be burned day and night, while the sun doesn't shine at night. Some of the energy captured during the day must be stored for nighttime use.For renewables to replace fossil fuels in transportation (28% of energy usein the U.S.), batteries must replace gasoline as the method of storing energy in a car.  With cheaper batteries, we can expect greater investments in renewable energy.Further, global energy storage is set to take off. Bloomberg New Energy Finance expects global energy storage capacity toincrease by a factor of 15by 2024. Developing countries can expect even larger increases; the World Bank Group predicted a40-fold growth in energy storage capacityby 2025.Catch Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's Under PressureBattery costs have declined 40% since 2014, and this will continue. In January, Tesla opened its $5 billiongigafactory, which will double the world's production capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Costs are sure to come down as TSLA scales up.And, Tesla isn't finished, yet; CEO Elon Musk wants to open up three more such gigafactories.Tesla's newPowerpack battery, revealed in October, packs twice the power capacity of the original, and Musk thinks TSLA can meet its goal of selling  500,000 electric cars per year as early as 2018.Clean energy could be nearing an inflection point, with dire implications for oil companies like XOM.Mitigating FactorsLow energy prices, like we are seeing now, could have a silver lining for oil companies - and for XOM stock. While low oil prices will reduce XOM's profitability, they also will ensure steady demand growth and slow the adoption of new energy-saving technologies. Musk said last year that cheap oil would be bad for EV makers like Tesla.Also, oil companies may now have a friend in the White House. President Donald Trump seems skeptical of climate change and more comfortable with smokestack industries than Barack Obama. And, Trump picked Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, which couldbenefit XOM stockas well.As of this writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right Now7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashWarren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) StockThe postExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) is Tumbling Today;2/27/2017;"On Monday, shares of storied electric car makerTesla Inc.TSLAare tumbling, down around 4.5% in morning trading to $245.42 per share after Goldman SachsGSdowngraded the automaker's stock. Analyst David Tamberrino turned negative, cutting TSLA to Sell from Neutral and slashing his six-month price target to $185 from $190.""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM (original-equipment market) peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs,"" Tamberrino said in a note to clients.Goldman is already expecting Tesla's launch of its low-cost, mass-market Model 3 to be delayed, despite reassurance from the company in its earnings report last week that the vehicle is on schedule to arrive in July. The firm also believes Tesla will be forced to issue $1.7 billion in shares in the upcoming third quarter to fund its capital-spending plans.The electric car maker's fourth quarter earnings were mixed, with strong revenues despite a significant net loss.

Warren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) have risen as much as 10% since I last issuedmy buy recommendationon Jan. 24, during which I predicted BAC stock will reach $28 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 25% returns.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrNow, though, it's possible that target might be underestimating Bank of America's real potential.As of Friday's close, BAC stock has improved by about 10% year-to-date, fueling most of a 16% run over the past three months. On Saturday, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), applauded Bank of America's decision to buy back stock:""Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite aggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.)""When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""According toBuffett's letter, Berkshire owns $5 billion of preferred Bank of America stock, which pays Berkshire $300 million annually. The ownership stake also carries a warrant that expires Sept. 2, 2021, which grants Berkshire the right to buy 700 million BAC common shares for $5 billion. According to Buffett's letter, the ability to exercise the warrant could net Berkshire a profit of $10.5 billion at the end of this year.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingAnd Buffett says Berkshire could easily pay the $5 billion for the 700 million BAC common shares by using its preferred shares. As such, it would make perfect sense to exercise the warrant, especially given the dividend Berkshire collects.In that regard, Buffett noted that Bank of America's annual dividend, currently at 30 cents, could rise some 50% before 2021 (when the warrant expires), topping 44 cents per share.Bottom Line for BAC StockAll told, Warren Buffett and Berkshire are in a win-win situation. What's more, from a valuation perspective, BAC stock - which is priced less-than 12 times fiscal 2018 estimates of 1$2.09 per share - still looks like a bargain compared to peersJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) andWells Fargo & Company(NYSE:WFC).Combined with Bank of America's cost-cutting strategy and measures to grow revenue on the back of higher interest rates, BAC stock looks like a no-brainer among financials.That's something Buffett - who said ""undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions"" - hinted at in his letter.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCatch Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's Under PressureThe 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe postWarren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate India;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile China's e-commerce market is still growing,Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) and its affiliate Ant Financial are already looking south to India. Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that theIndian e-commerce marketwould grow the fastest globally, to $119 billion by 2020. And Alibaba stock is poised to benefit.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat's driving e-commerce and fintech in India? India passed the U.S. as the world's No. 2 smartphone market last year, with 220 million users . T he number of smartphone users in India is expected to balloon to 810 million by 2021 and India's 3G and 4G networks could cover 300 million subscribers by March 2018.India's young and growing population is increasingly tech-savvy, especially millennials.India's government also supports a cashless economy, seeing this as a way to reduce corruption and tax evasion. The Indian government alsoremoved the largest banknotes, 500 rupee and 1000 rupee notes, from the economy. This led to an explosion in the use ofmobile wallets in India, adding as many as  1 million users added per day .Last year, the National Payments Corporation of India announced theUnified Payment Interface, making it convenient for Indians to access their bank accounts on their phones and pay.And all these moving parts flow into the bull case for Alibaba stock.Taking Ant's Strategy to IndiaAlibaba and Ant (formerly Alipay) invested inOne97Communications, the parent company of Indian e-commerce player Paytm. They are expected to increase their stake to 50% from 42%. Paytm last year spun off its payments business to comply with regulations. One97 holds a 49% stake in Paytm Payments Bank and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma owns 51%.Paytm boasted177 million usersat the end of the year and CFO Madhur Deora has set a medium-term target of 500 million users . That growth would be a boost for Alibaba stock and Ant Financial which seeks2 billion users worldwideover the next decade.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightPaytm is clearly taking a page out of Alibaba and Ant Financial's playbook. Like BABA'sMyBank-  the bank ""for the little guy"" - Paytm's bank promises to be a vehicle for financial inclusion, bringing services to India's unbanked.Like Ant, Paytm also wants to offer loans andasset management servicesto those who can't access them now.Ant Fortune, a wealth management app, debuted in 2015. Its users can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directly to businesses.Paytm's Threat to BanksBanks in both countries are threatened by this disruption. Ant's Yuebao offers depositors higher interest rates than banks andinstant withdrawals. Technology companies don't have to maintain as many employees at branches as banks do, and can link borrowers and savers directly. Their asset-light model is simply more efficient than that of existing banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burdened by legacy systems and regulation.Banks earn a profit on the spread, the difference between the rate at which they lend and the rates they offer depositors. Platforms that connect borrowers and lenders and cut out the middleman can exert pressure on this. And because Paytm and Ant Financial are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fees than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potential enemy to banks. It will help them drum up business by cross-selling their services to its users. But Paytm will probably be the front-end in customer interactions and relegate the banks to the back end .Banks risk becoming ""dumb pipes."" As I mentioned inmy articlelast year, the front-end generally gives banks a higher return on equity than the back. AMcKinsey & Companystudy found that banks earn a 22% return on equity from sales and origination, but only 6% from the extension of credit.Protectionism RisksAll of this doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risks still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rising in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobber their Indian rivals. Indian startups such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuations repeatedly marked down over the past year. Now some are asking for protection against supposedly unfair foreign competition. Indian venture capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capital called for such measures, followed bysimilar sentimentfrom the founders of e-commerce player Flipkart and Ola, viewed as India's home-grown Uber) .Since Paytm is an Indian company, why would this be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, its largest shareholders are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a company controlling something as critical as its payments infrastructure? Experts have raised concerns overPaytm user dataending up in servers outside of India.Pointing to Paytm's Chinese ties, the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee accused the prime minister ofcompromising national security. The Sino-Indian relationship is contentious; the two countries went to war as recently as 1962 over a border dispute.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectFor Paytm to work, users must see it as secure and reliable. Without trust, Paytm cannot succeed. However, in December the Paytm server was down for an hour, leaving users unable to make payments.Paytm's customer service also is a weak spot, with many rating it as bad. Also, the recent user increase may be temporary. After March 13, Paytm may lose as much as 30% of its offline customers once cash withdrawal limits end.Bottom Line on Alibaba StockEven if Paytm and BABA succeed, however, buying Alibaba stock is notwithout risks.Alibaba is a variable interest entity, which means American shareholders own shares in a Cayman Islands-based entity. Chinese law forbids foreign ownership in Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, so this structure is a way around it.But the Chinese government's position isn't clear, and it could always change its mind, at the expense of BABA stock holders.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 Surprise7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate Indiaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Ever;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLost in the collapse ofUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) stock over the past year is an odd divergence between two classes of stock. Shares of UAA stock (Class A) have traded at a substantial premium to UA stock (Class C). The difference is about 10% at the moment, in fact.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat gap makes little sense. Class C UA stock has no voting rights. Class A UAA stock does have voting rights of one vote per share. But those rights don't have much value. CEO and founder Kevin Plank owns all of the non-trading Class B shares, which have 10 votes each, giving Plank 65% of the voting power as of December 2016.UAA shareholders are paying a premium for votes which are largely symbolic. And it's not as if other considerations justify that gap. The market is figuring out the divergence, as the 10% premium has narrowed of late. But there's still time for easy profits in shorting UAA and going long UA.As for investors bullish on Under Armour, there's basically no reason to pay up for the UAA stock.No, UAA Stock Isn't Worth More Than UA StockAs seen in the chart below, the gap between UA and UAA has narrowed of late, after peaking in November.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAt one point in late November - less than a year after the Class C UA stock was issued - the gap was over 20%, a huge number. In dollars, the difference has dropped to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compression has come from the fact that Under Armour stock has declined precipitously after two disappointing earnings reports.With the largely symbolic voting rights not likely to change anytime soon, there's simply very little reason for UA to trade above UAA.According to theregistration statementfiled by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holders of Under Armour stock are entitled to the same dividends. The only way for Class A shareholders to gain some sort of majority voting power would be for Plank to be terminated for cause or to give up his shares.Neither outcome seems particularly likely given that the CEO is 42 years old, intensely competitive, and intent on turning around his beloved Under Armour himself.Liquidity doesn't justify the different prices for Under Armour stock, either, with one possible exception.There was a notable divergence in equity volume a few months ago. UA stock had an average volume under 1 million shares per day in October, roughly 20% of UAA stock. But volume over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million shares a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increase in UA volume probably has something to do with the narrowing premium and implies that the spread will continue to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockThere is one notable difference between UA and UAA: options volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 puts is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 calls open at the moment.That difference is not enough to justify a 10% premium, however, particularly for smaller investors. And it seems the market is figuring that out. But the gap remains wide enough that there's still room to make what should be close to risk-free profits by going long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAny major event - like an acquisition, as unlikely as that seems at the moment - will treat shareholders equally. Any dividend payments will be the same. The only difference between UA and UAA is the opportunity to vote even though those votes have no practical impact.So an arbitrage trade still looks like it has some upside. Voting rights between classes at other stocks usually are below 5%, meaning a long UA/short UAA trade could make another $1 per share with very low risk.For investors who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice. The premium for UAA stock simply doesn't make a lot of sense - and it's still wide enough to profit from.The author is long UA and short UAA.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 SurpriseThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postUnder Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Everappeared first onInvestorPlace."

How Tesla Is Ensuring the Model 3 Delivers on Quality;2/27/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S and Model X were the first two models   built entirely by the super-innovative Silicon Valley auto   start-up.

These 2 Big-Brand Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap;2/26/2017;"It's getting harder and harder to find value in the stock   market. But there are still a few sectors that Mr. Market seems   to have overlooked. One big one: auto stocks.Not all auto stocks have been overlooked, of course. Silicon   Valley's electric-car darling,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , gets alotof attention from investors. It's obvious why: Tesla's story is   arguably the future of autos, unfolding here in the present.   Investors love that.The thing is, Tesla isn't the only company moving the auto   industry from the gas-guzzling present to a connected,   electrified future. A few of the old automakers are right in the   cutting-edge mix, making smart, aggressive moves to thrive and   profit as the industry transforms.makeArticleAd();To some extent, those stories are happening a bit below Wall   Street's radar. Investors haven't yet caught on, in part because   Tesla's story has overshadowed the others.That's a prime recipe for value. Here are two big-name   automakers that are well-positioned for the future, available   today at value prices -- both sporting dividend yields over   4%.Ford Motor Company: Using pickup profits to transformWhen you think ofFord Motor Company(NYSE: F) , you might think about huge-selling pickup trucks, or   Ford's dramatic turnaround a few years ago.You probably aren't thinking about electric cars,   self-driving, or new concepts of personal mobility that don't   involve selling cars to individuals. But CEO Mark Fields and his   team, all battle-tested veterans of that turnaround, are doing a   lot of thinking about all of those things these days.Ford's super-profitable pickups are helping to fund electric     cars and new high-tech businesses as the Blue Oval transforms.     Image source: Ford Motor Company.In fact, they're doing more than thinking. Last fall, Ford   explained how it's transforming itself into an ""automotive and   mobility company."" In a nutshell, Ford is making major moves to   optimize the profitability of its current business while   simultaneously making biginvestmentsinself-driving,electric vehicles, and newtechnology-enabled conceptsof ""mobility,"" ortransportation as a service. (Click on each to learn more.)Ford is already solidly profitable. It postedoperating profit of $10.4 billion in 2016(its second-best ever) with a 6.7% operating profit margin in its   auto-related business. Ford's near-term goal is to get that   margin up to a sustainable 8% by investing in its strengths   (including all thoseextremely profitable pickup trucks) and boosting the profitability of its weaker lines of business,   likesmall carsand theresurgent Lincoln luxury brand.Ford plans to begin mass-producing self-driving cars for     fleet use in 2021. It may also sell its self-driving system to     other automakers. Image source: Ford Motor Company.That margin boost will in turn help fund Ford's new lines of   business. Those will be even more profitable: Ford is targetingoperating margin of 20% or betterin each.Long story short: Ford's bottom line is primed for significant   growth over the next few years, much of it driven by technology.   But right now, it's trading at just 7 times its adjusted 2016   earnings, while paying avery sustainable4.8% dividend.General Motors: Jumping ahead of Silicon ValleyI've listedGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) second only because investors have started to catch on   to its great story. While Ford's stock price hasn't done much   over the last year, GM's is up almost 28%. But as I'll explain,   at just 6.1 times 2016 earnings, GM's stock is still a very good   value given the story that's unfolding.GMdata byYChartsIn a lot of ways, GM's story is like Ford's. GM is making big   moves to boost the profitability of its core business while   investing in new technology-enabled businesses that will help it   thrive and profit instead of being ""disrupted"" as the industry   transforms.But GM is arguably farther along. GM beat everyone, even   Tesla, to market with anaffordable 200-plus-mile electric car. It's gearing up for ahuge test of ""thousands"" of self-driving   vehicleswith ride-hailing start-up Lyft, of which GMowns 9%. GM's car-sharing business, Maven, is afast-growing high-tech rival to Zipcar-- and as with GM's partnership with Lyft, Maven is introducing   lots of young urban folks to GM's best new models.The electric Chevy Bolt is GM's platform for future tech --     and the first of a whole line of electric GM vehicles. Image     source: General Motors.Meanwhile, GM's core business is already performing at a level   few could have imagined a decade ago. Itearned $12.5 billion in operating profitlast year, with a margin of 7.5%, on all-time record revenue of   $166.4 billion. CEO Mary Barra thinks GM can do better: Several   initiatives are under way to push that margin up into the 8% to   10% range over the next few years.GM'sdividend is deliberately conservative, to ensure that it's sustainable through a downturn. But even   so, and despite the run-up in GM's stock price over the last   year, it's still yielding about 4.1%. Rather than raising the   dividend to levels it might not be able to sustain, GM is   returning cash to its owners with share buybacks --$14 billion worthsince early 2015.Long story short, here's what you get with GM today: profit   growth, cutting-edge technology, a strong and steady dividend, an   ongoing share-buyback program, and a value price.10 stocks we like even better than Ford and General   MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

ETFs in Focus on Tesla???s Mixed Q4 Results;2/26/2017;"Tesla Inc.released its fourth-quarter 2016 results after market hours on February 22, 2017,posting revenues of $2.28 billion, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.201 billion.  However, the company reported a loss of $1.25 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.19 per share.  This number excludes 47 cents from non-recurring items. Concurrent with the release, Tesla also announced that CFO,Jason Wheelerwill be resigning in April 2017.OutlookInitial production of the company's Model 3 is on track to begin this July while volume production is expected by September. Tesla expects capital expenditure between  $2 billion and $2.5 billion ahead of the start of Model 3 production. Tesla expects to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined in the first half of 2017, which represents vehicle delivery growth of 61% to 71% compared with the year-ago period.Currently, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  The stock was up 1.52% to $277.67 in after-hours trading following the earnings release owing to the revenue beat.Given the earnings report and investors' reaction, we have selected the following ETFs that are heavily invested in the company.

Just Wait: Better Batteries Are Going to Turn the Energy Industry Upside Down;2/26/2017;"Sometimes it's hard to see innovation happening until one day,   you wake up and realize everything has changed. A decade ago,   smartphones were the stuff of science fiction, cheap solar energy   was a pipe dream, and Elon Musk was still struggling to keep his   electric car startup alive. Today, all three are huge growth   stories.The underlying technologies that drove the innovative products   in smartphones, solar, and EVs were present in 2007, but most   people just didn't see how they could be practically adapted to   revolutionize the world in such a short time.Today, improvements in battery technology are on the cusp of   changing everything we know about energy in transportation and   electricity. The groundwork has already been laid, and a decade   from now, we'll look back and think about how obvious the   transformation should have been ahead of time.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Batteries are the new solar panelsBefore we dive into how batteries will change everything, I   think it's important to frame what's going on today. The future   of growing battery use and falling cost has some precedent in the   energy industry. When I started writing for The Motley Fool in   2010, the solar power industry was small, andthe cost to manufacture a solar panel was about   $1.10 per watt, meaning buying a panel on the open market would cost you around   $1.60 per watt. In 2017, solar panel prices hit $0.40 per watt on   the spot market, a quarter of their cost just seven years   earlier, and a much faster cost reduction than anyone had   predicted. It's no coincidence that between 2010 and 2016 solar   installations globally nearly quintupled from 16 GW to74 GW.The same dynamic is happening in the battery market today,   with massive capacity additions, cost reductions, and technology   improvements happening at multiple companies simultaneously   around the world.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory gets a lot of attention, and Musk   has said a 35% reduction in battery costs could be coming. Worth   noting that he claimed his costs were below $190 per kWh early   last year.By 2020, the forecasts have battery costs falling to below   $100 per kWh, with manufacturersSamsung,Panasonic, andLG Chemleading the way. LG Chem is the supplier for the recently   launched Chevy Bolt, which reportedly got battery cells for just   $145 per kWH.On top of these cost reductions, industry sources say that   energy density has doubled, allowing more energy to be packed   into a smaller space. And as space constraints fall and costs   come down, the potential for batteries to disrupt the energy   sector increases.Changing everything we thought we knew about     transportationWhen electric vehicles started to emerge on the scene, battery   cost alone was a deterrent to manufacturing or buying them. When   batteries were $400 per kWh a few years ago, that meant that by   itself, the 65 kWh battery that powered a Tesla cost $26,000. But   with $100 per kWh pricing on the horizon, a 100 kWh battery would   cost just $10,000 and provide a car over 300 miles in range per   charge, making EVs a much more palatable choice.It's no coincidence thatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) ,BMW, Tesla, and many others are accelerating their EV development   now. Batteries themselves are no longer a hurdle for the industry   to get over; soon, they will be a cost advantage over   conventional vehicles.I'm also becoming more convinced that transportation can be   disrupted on a larger scale. Electric buses built by companies   likeProterraare now cost competitive with diesel powered models,Mercedes-Benzis testing urban e-trucks, and new companies likeNicola Oneare launching electric semi-tractors.The market growth of electric vehicles of all sizes is like a   ball rolling down a hill -- we just don't know how fast it's   rolling or where it's going to land. But with battery prices   dropping, we can be assured that the disruption in the   transportation industry is just beginning.Electricity will never be the sameWhile batteries in vehicles will be a highly visible   application, power storage may be just as important to the energy   industry overall. Batteries can store energy to make the grid   more reliable, to offset the intermittence of renewable energy   sources like wind and solar, and even justify delaying or   cancelling the construction of ""peaker plants"" that come online   only during periods of high demand.The incredible innovation better, cheaper batteries allow is   the ability to think of electricity as more than a constant   supply-and-demand equation. Since the grid was built, generators   had to match their production capacity with peak demand, no   matter what that demand was. Now, we can move excess supply from   one time of a day to another, and begin to start using energy   more efficiently.Batteries can also be installed in homes, at businesses, or by   grid operators. When a customer can react to price signals at a   moment's notice or can cheaply and easily store the energy from   their rooftop solar panels for use at night, it changes the   electricity business forever.Batteries are going to change everythingThe rapid cost reductions and improving technology in the   battery industry are going to change a lot of what we thought we   knew about energy. And as these products get more cost effective   they'll become more common and soon they'll be commonplace.A decade from now, it won't be strange to drive an electric   car, or take an electric bus, home from work, and flip on lights   that are powered by solar or wind-generated electricity stored in   your battery system. The revolution is clearly happening, and   investors should make sure they're on the right side of the   disruption so they don't get run over.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, I'd like to take a look at three stocks -Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) andSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) - that caused the biggest reactions this week.makeArticleAd();Source:FamZoo Staff via Flickr (Modified)It's fun to dig into quarterly numbers, but it's equally fun watching investors react to those very numbers and sometimes exaggerate even the slightest deviation from the models.So much hope is already leveraged in every tick on these charts that a penny can create or destroy billions in market cap - and when many high-multiple names report simultaneously, the fireworks get intense.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThis week, the fireworks were intense.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla Inc (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockTesla probably has the biggest cult on Wall Street right now, producing just 83,000 cars a year to justify a $45 billion valuation.The key, as always, is growth: According to Elon Musk's conference call last night, the assembly line should accelerate 500% this year and then double again in 2018. News that sales last quarter ramped up 30% year-over-year supports the still-hypothetical timeline and it even brings it incrementally closer.Beyond that all-important ramp, TSLA is still bleeding cash, which is far from surprising. While the burn rate is narrowing, Musk is still going to be burning capital for at least another year.Until then, the market feels comfortable moving Tesla Inc shares around at roughly 4.4x trailing sales - and this quarter at least, Musk gave us a reason to keep cheering in the long-term.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Fitbit Inc (FIT)Source:Via FitbitFitbit, on the other hand, may be bouncing now, but the fallen star is still staring down the gun of declining sales and it has little concrete comfort to give investors wondering whether to hang around a few years for the product mix to turn around.That may never happen. FIT sales in the key holiday quarter came in a little below Wall Street's already heavily discounted forecasts. A few months ago, the bulls were counting on this quarter to bring year-over-year growth back, but it's clear that just didn't happen.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverNow that the final numbers are on the table, sales actually declined nearly 20% from last year, which pushes the recovery window back to 2019, if not beyond. That's a long time to run at a loss, and in the meantime, Fitbit Inc's research and development investment lags entrenched would-be competitors who want the wearable computing market for themselves.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Square Inc (SQ)Source:Via SquareSquare showed us the biggest fireworks. The stock was geared for 20% top-line growth, while Wall Street wanted confirmation that revenue would clear $2 billion across the current year in order to keep that growth ramp - and we got it.What has earned the company a standing ovation is management's success when it comes to reducing the quarterly cash burn. SQ should actually break even on an adjusted basis in its next earnings report and earn as much as $0.19 a share for all of 2017 once all the ""adjustments"" are made.If so, we're a lot closer to GAAP profitability than many people thought. Inflection points like that do great things to stock valuations, which is why people are piling in on Square Inc now while they can.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Netflix, Inc.: How to Buy NFLX Stock on the Cheap;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's far from a unique viewing experience -Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has forged a massive post-election rally to all-time-highs. But given the exaggerated level of overall market optimism, I think a scary picture could show up in a pricey NFLX stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)For investors looking to pick up shares while there's blood in the streets, Netflix stock is offerign that kind of opportunity today.If you're a Netflix bull, it probably has to do with the company's sizable advantage in the SVOD or streaming video on demand? Or maybe you enjoy Netflix's original and top-notch content likeHouse of Cards,Stranger Things,Orange is the New BlackorTheCrown?Bullish investors might also begawking over Netflix's earnings beat last monthand the company's unexpectedly strong international subscriber growth which easily topped forecasts. At the end of the day, Netflix deserves credit for its accomplishments.The bad news is if you're an NFLX stock holder right now, you're paying dearly those successes. Netflix is expensive by most any measure and ultimately will require a good deal of things to continue to go right.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteBottom line: Competition and the rising cost to do business to remain top dog aren't going away anytime soon. But that's not to say Netflix can't remain expensive, or that it won't continue to dominate the SVOD space. Growth stocks like Netflix historically have a knack of keeping shares beyond the reach of value investors during their greatest periods of price appreciation. And for quite a few years, NFLX stock has been a poster child of this phenomenon.Personally, I subscribe both literally and figuratively to Netflix's largess, and overall, its product as a consumer. Netflix isn't perfect, but I am happily willing to pay for it. That said, I think NFLX could be ready to hit the rewind button. And that means it's not time to outright purchase shares.But …NFLX Stock ChartClick to EnlargeNetflix has gained 30% since a post-election low near $111. Prior pivot resistance and the 62% retracement level offered technical support.As part of those gains, shares broke out from a weekly handle and then its all-time-highs of $133.27 as a large corrective cup pattern was cleared. Given the size and duration of the chart formation, Netflix's breakout move of around 10% above the cup isn't considered technically extended.That's the good news.The bad news is the overall market's less stingy behavior, Netflix's overbought stochastics and the stock's rich market multiple. I think a test of the prior highs will develop, and NFLX stock will offer a better entry point.How to Trade NFLX StockRight now, I like the 24 Mar $134/$130 put spread. With shares of Netflix sitting around $143, the out-of-the-money vertical is priced for a credit of 50 cents mid-market. If NFLX stock is above $134 at expiration, the sold premium amounts to a return of 14% for the one-month holding period. This allows for a decline or margin of safety of more than 6%.A breakeven of $133.50 fits in very nicely with our anticipated test of prior highs discussed above. But if NFLX moves lower and fails to hold support, ultimately this vertical limits the investor's risk to $3.50 no matter how low shares might sink.Why Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Plunged, And Why You Should BuyIf investors fail to capture the credit and are faced with a loss, and they're still a fan of Netflix stock, they can receive shares through assignment or close the spread and purchase stock instead.If you do want to buy NFLX stock, the most you would pay is $133.50. What's more, this ensures that an effective entry price is never more than $3.50 above the current share price.That's good news, just in case.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NUGT): Free Profits!;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGold is a rare, precious and always in demand especially from China and India. I usually like to go long gold on dips, but I don't see obvious entry points. However, theDirexion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust(NYSEARCA:NUGT) options allow me to structure trades around the miners. But remember: NUGT is a leveraged vehicle that trades on gold miners, so caution is always warranted.makeArticleAd();Source:Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified)I'll point out that I just booked profits long theSPDR Gold Trust (ETF)(NYSEARCA:GLD). There could be more upside in my technical breakout, but GLD is facing recently difficult levels.Fundamentally, I prefer going long GLD than NUGT, but in this ube- bullish equity market, gold miner companies should catch bids. In other words, this 3x ETF should benefit from bullish equity markets and bullish gold prices.Click to EnlargeTechnically, I have to recognize a potential bullish setup for NUGT. It could be triggered around $13.7 per share and could carry it to $16 per share or higher.How to Trade NUGT Right NowThe Bet:Sell NUGT Apr $8/$7 credit put spread for 20 cents per contract to open. I am basically betting that NUGT won't revisit the extreme lows of December 2016. My reward if successful would be 25% on money risked. The 30% buffer from current price gives me an 85% theoretical chance of success.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowUsually I like to balance my trades. In this case I want to sell upside risk against my bullish NUGT position.The Hedge (Optional):Sell NUGT Jun $20/$21 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 20 cents per contract to open. If successful, this trade would yield 25% on money risked. This trade also carries a 85% theoretical chance of success based on current conditions.Taking both trades won't make it a perfect iron condor, but it would be the spirit of one. I have a total of 40 cents per contract in potential profit, but the timing is staggered. This would allow for easier trade management in leveraged tickers like NUGT.Ideally, I want this ETF's price to be rangebound between both sold spreads for it to expire worthless for maximum gains.I am not required to hold my options trades through expiration.

Why Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Plunged, And Why You Should Buy;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street is a fickle beast. All you need to confirm that isTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The company reported a fourth-quarter loss that narrowed to 69 cents per share from $2.02 a year ago, and revenues that nearly doubled from to $2.28 billion from $1.21 billion. And yet, TSLA stock plunged roughly 6.4% following the report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat even ignored Tesla's announcement that Model 3 production was on pace with expectations and that it would deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles in the first quarter compared to just 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016.What gives?Well, there are several reasons that the financial media are floating for the drop in Tesla stock.Earnings missed expectationsfor a loss of only 43 cents per share (even though revenue bested Wall Street's forecast for $2.19 billion).There is also the narrative that margins and revenue are cloudy due to the SolarCity acquisition.Finally, the prevailing story for the knee-jerk selloff in TSLA stock is thatCEO Elon Musk hintedthat the company could issue more shares to raise capital for Model 3 production.All of these are valid reasons for a selloff.The problem is that Wall Street and investors knew about all of these factors prior to Tesla's quarterly earnings report.  In fact, afterOppenheimer said on Feb. 14that investors should expect Tesla to take advantage of its recent highs to issue new stock to raise funds for Model 3 production, TSLA stock went on a two-day 4% rally to a new all-time high.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowWhich brings us to the real reason Tesla stock is down following earnings: profit taking.What's Going on With Tesla?Click to EnlargeShares are up an impressive 32% since the November elections, with most of those gains coming since the start of 2017. As a result, TSLA was considerably overbought, and traders are taking this opportunity to use previously known issues to take profits off the table.If you're in holding TSLA stock for the long-term, don't panic. According to Tesla's quarterly report, the Model 3 is still on track for full production in July, and deliveries are ramping up in fine style (remember 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles in the first quarter compared to just 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016?)  And that's not to mention the opportunities that Tesla is working on outside of is electric vehicle operations.In fact, with Tesla trading at a discount near $255 on Friday, TSLA stock is a buy.The problem isn't whether shares will bounce back, it's a matter of how to pick them up amid the current market volatility.The answer is options.Looking out over the short-term, March TSLA options implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 7% heading into expiration. As a result, the upper bound lies at about $269, while the lower bound rests near $234.With key support near $250, I would be extremely surprised to see TSLA stock trade near $235, and the upper bound of $269 rests well shy of the stock's recent all-time highs, leaving plenty of room for a rebound run higher.2 Trades for TSLA StockMarried Put:On way to buy Tesla at current levels and ensure you have peace of mind in your portfolio is to enter what is called a ""married put."" In this strategy, traders buy to open one front-month at-the-money or out-of-the-money TSLA put for every 100 shares purchased.The strike of the purchased put should reflect your risk tolerance. So, a March $250 put offers nearly full protection at current levels, with losses limited to about the cost of the put and brokerage fees. An out-of-the-money March $245 put would allow for TSLA to dip a bit further before the ""insurance"" kicked in.Buy Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock While the World Hates ItAt last check, the TSLA March $250 put was offered at $6.78, or $678 per contract, while the stock position would total $roughly $252 at pre-open levels. If TSLA closes below $250 when March options expire, you would be able to exit the position and avoid any additional losses by exercising the put.Finally, if Tesla holds above $200 through March expiration, you can roll the $250 put forward into April if you feel you still need the protection.Put Sell:You'll usually see me recommend put sell positions as a way to capture premium on a stock, but you can also use these options as a way to essentially name the price you want to pay for a stock. If you want to own TSLA stock, but want to wait for it to dip below $250, you could sell the March $250 put for $6.78, or $678 per contract, collect the premium, and wait for the shares to pull back.If Tesla doesn't trade below $250, you still keep the premium and can roll your target out to the next contract month and try again. The downside here is that if TSLA never hits your target, you never own the shares at the price you want to pay.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money GrabAmazon.com, Inc.

JPMorgan Fund Boosts Retirement Accounts With Hot Stocks;2/24/2017;"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund   (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned   into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon   for investors holding the fund inretirement accountsand other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going   into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked   by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the   fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its   peers.makeArticleAd();The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmakerBroadcom(AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of theIBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE:Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally     acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry     Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial     breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this     level,so investors may want to consider locking-in     some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more     conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking     profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmakerTesla(TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On   Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its   mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car-   and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per   share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts.   Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its   battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the   stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback   left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and   mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook(FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was   another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which   the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this   year.Facebookis ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has   a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax   margin is 60%.Amazon(AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a   so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds   from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a   row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the   company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of   Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those includedUnitedHealth Group(UNH),Southwest Airlines(LUV),MercadoLibra(MELI),Morgan Stanley(MS) andFedEx(FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The   others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has   posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames.   It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group,   thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining   EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter.   Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And   its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1   e-commerce company. It is often referred to as theeBay(EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's   Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four   consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No.   1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group.   Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected   to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its   industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS   growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the   past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth   rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual   EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names likeApple(AAPL) andMasterCard(MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the   80s and 90s, includingHome Depot(HD),Nvidia(NVDA) andComcast(CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99   Comp Rating - the highest possible - and six straight   quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last   quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap     Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock     Gains In 2017"

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM) Stock: Profit From the Pain;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis tech stock rally has been one for the ages. But now is not the time for bulls to rest on their laurels. Overbought conditions in theNasdaq Compositecoupled with Thursday's down day make now the perfect time to get defensive. And what better way to do that then add some bearish plays to the portfolio?Akamai Technologies, Inc.(NASDAQ:AKAM) is looking particularly vulnerable, so let's see what kind of trade we can drum up in AKAM stock.makeArticleAd();All was going swell with Akamai until this month's earnings announcement. The cloud services provider was perched near 52-week highs heading into the quarterly dance. And then, AKAM dared to disappoint the Street. Note that Akamai recorded beats on both the top and bottom lines - but apparently those beats simply weren't enough.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixMercy was thrown out the window, and sellers took AKAM stock down 10% by day's end. Since then, the stock has been drifting lower in bearish fashion.Though the 200-day moving average is still pointing higher, the 20-day and 50-day averages have rolled over. And that means any and all rallies in Akamai stock are suspect.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe level to watch moving forward is $62. A break of this support zone could lead to a gap-fill carrying shares down to $59.The Trade on AKAM StockTo capitalize on continued bearish behavior, consider selling April bear call spreads. The strategy enables you to profit from the passage of time. One of the biggest benefits to the bear call spread is its high probability of profit. We can create a wide profit zone that generates modest rewards if Akamai does anything but rally significantly.Sell the Apr $65/$67.50 call spread for 64 cents. The position consists of selling to open the $65 call while buying to open the $67.50 call. Your reward will be limited to the 64 cents which will be captured if AKAM stock sits below $65 at expiration.Don't Pay for Square Inc (SQ) Stock, Get It for Free!The risk is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net credit, or $1.86, and will be forfeited if AKAM rallies above $67.50 by expiration.If you're looking for more downside confirmation before entering the trade, consider waiting for a break of the previously mentioned $62 support level.As of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceChesapeake Energy: Catch This Falling KnifeAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money GrabTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryThe postAkamai Technologies, Inc.

Chesapeake Energy: Catch This Falling Knife;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChesapeake Energy Corporation(NYSE:CHK) reported earnings on Thursday, and Wall Street sold CHK stock down 3%. Chesapeake beat expectations for the most part, but traders found offsetting reasons to worry.makeArticleAd();Source:Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrFundamentally, Chesapeake Energy is not on solid footing. It has internal issues with regards to production and high debt. The company also faces the ongoing hurdles in the energy arena. So to say that CHK stock is a sure bet for longs would be a stretch.It is noteworthy that most analysts already are realistic with regards to Chesapeake Energy Corporation's prospects. Most ratings have it as a hold. So the threat of downgrades is low.Technically, having just lost an important neckline, CHK stock is at risk of further downside even past $5 per share. Trying to catch this falling machete could cost me a few fingers.Click to EnlargeLuckily, the options markets allow me to set cautious long CHK positions. The trick is to find levels that are relatively safe and that won't be breached. The underlying assumption to this trade setup is that the company will survive.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsI don't need Chesapeake Energy to rally; I just need it to not fall more than 30% this year.How to Trade CHK Stock HereThe Bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $4 put for 50 cents per contract to open. The 30% buffer from current price gives this trade a 70% theoretical chance of success. Usually I like bigger starting buffers for leaps, but in this case, I am banking on the aforementioned assumption holding true.Selling naked puts is risky and therefore is not appropriate for all investors. I can modify the trade into a spread instead to limit the risk and thereby rendering it more conducive to conservative traders.The Alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $4/$3.50 credit put spread. This still is a bullish trade and I still need CHK stock to stay above the same strike sold. But here my risk is finite. I collect 15 cents per contract to open.

Don’t Pay for Square Inc (SQ) Stock, Get It for Free!;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) stock, unlike that ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), is flying high. One can argue that Jack Dorsey is spending more time running SQ and not enough time tending to the struggling Twitter.makeArticleAd();Source:Via SquareBoth companies reported earnings recently, with TWTR falling 12% or so whereas SQ stock spiked 14% on the news.I rarely chase spikes of this size, but in relation to its initial offering, SQ stock could be headed much higher in the long term. The company seems to be doing all the right things to keep Wall Street interested in owning its stock.Fundamentally, Square has formidable competitors, but I think they managed to carve a great niche. Yes, they have to battle giants likePaypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL), but to me they don't seem like comparable in my portfolio.Before you call me stupid for uttering those words, I am only interested in the stock price perspective. I see Square stock as a faster runner with more momentum aback the ""hopium"" of exciting innovation that is yet to come. I use PayPal often and have never used Square … but perception is all that matters for price action.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThe Bet:Buy the SQ Jun $18/$19 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade that costs 35 cents per contract to open. If SQ stock rallies past my spread by mid-June, then I stand to double my money. There are hundreds of other ways I can use options to accomplish this.Usually I like to hedge my bets. In this case, I will sell downside risk to negate my out-of-pocket expense into my long trade.The Bank:Sell the SQ Jan 2018 $12 put. I collect 70 cents per contract to open. The buffer from current price gives me an 85% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is risky because I am committing to buying the stock at my sold strike if SQ stock falls below it. So my thesis better hold up or I could be exposed to losses below $11.30 per share. Conversely, if SQ stock stays above my sold puts, any premium I capture from selling my long call position is pure profit. So I don't really need SQ to rally much to profit.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowI am not required to hold the any options trades through expiration.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money Grab;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt first blush, the purchase byAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) ofMoneygram International Inc(NASDAQ:MGI) doesn't seem like a huge deal for BABA stock. Alibaba affiliateAntFinancialis paying $880 million for MGI, after all. Yet, Alibaba stock is worth nearly $250 billion - almost 300 times the acquisition price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI wouldn't dismiss the deal as ""minor"" so quickly, however. While the purchase price isn't high, and the near-term impact on BABA stock is likely minimal, Moneygram highlights the long-term strategy and potential for Alibaba.The bull case for Alibaba stock has two major pillars: First, the company can move beyond China to being a worldwide player and a legitimate competitor toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Second, like Amazon, Alibaba can move from its e-commerce roots into all sort of profitable efforts.The Moneygram acquisition scores well on both counts. Alibaba continues its push into the West. And, through the tie-up of Ant Financial and Moneygram, it continues its entry into the potentially lucrative digital banking and payment services markets.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowStrategically, the deal lays the groundwork for further growth of BABA stock - and at a very reasonable price. Investors shouldn't dismiss the deal simply because the price doesn't seem high enough to matter.Alibaba Stock Needs International GrowthAt the moment, Alibaba's business still relies on Chinese e-commerce. In the company's third quarter (ending Dec. 31), China commerce generated 80% of revenue, with ~96% of that figure coming from retail. Other businesses, including cloud computing and entertainment, make up the other 20%. But, those businesses remain unprofitable; Alibaba earnings remain dependent on Chinese commerce. That's a bit of risk on its own, given concerns about the Chinese economy.Ant Financial isn't consolidated onto Alibaba's P&L, and at the moment, BABA has a profit-sharing agreement and could take up to one-third of Ant's equity in an IPO. But, even that minority ownership means Alibaba can use Ant Financial as an entrance into international markets, and that's where Moneygram fits nicely.To begin, Ant can target Chinese expatriates in the U.S. and elsewhere. Ant already has joint ventures and partnerships worldwide, and Moneygram further supports its payment infrastructure. Plus, Alibaba's other offerings such as e-commerce, entertainment and even cloud services, can follow Ant's lead.At a valuation of nearly $250 billion, Alibaba stock probably can't hold up on the Chinese market alone, considering the sheer size of that market. There are too many concerns about the macro environment in that country. Internet and e-commerce penetration is increasing, but still low relative to developed countries. Every step Alibaba takes toward becoming a legitimate international presence - and a real competitor to Amazon - supports the bull case for BABA stock.The Moneygram purchase is actually a big step in that direction.Alibaba Isn't Just a RetailerIt's hard to imagine what Amazon.com might look like had the company decided to be ""only"" an e-commerce retailer. It's almost certain that AMZN stock would trade well below its current levels of approximately $840 per share.Alibaba has certainly learned lessons from its American peer. It's moved into cloud as well, where the companyhas built a viable businesswith worldwide aspirations. Now, Alibaba is looking to Hollywood for growth.Further, the company has the infrastructure for a worldwide payments business, at a time when the future of that industry is in serious flux. That's a significant opportunity for BABA stock, even for a company the size of Alibaba's, and even with the company owning only a portion of Ant Financial.Paypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth more than $50 billion. Combined,Visa Inc(NYSE:V),Mastercard Inc(NYSE:MA) andAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) are valued around $400 billion.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThat's not to suggest that Ant is the next Visa, or even the next Paypal. But, Ant's efforts in payment services can move the needle for Alibaba stock, even given BABA's $250 billion valuation. Plus, Visa and Mastercard don't have the added luxury of using a payment services platform to grow retail sales.All told, I continue to believe that BABA stock is undervalued. I don't know that the Moneygram acquisition changes that dramatically in the near term, but it highlights the potential of the long-term strategy here. Owning a Chinese e-commerce retailer might seem to have a lot risk at the moment, but Alibaba isn't just a Chinese e-commerce retailer anymore - and that's good news for BABA stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple Inc.

3 Stocks to Watch on Friday: Acacia Communications, Inc. (ACIA), Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) and Nordstrom, Inc.

TheS&P 500 Indexposted a gain of a fraction of a percentage, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained 0.2% and theNasdaq Compositelost 0.4%.makeArticleAd();It was another busy earnings day that included mixed results from several companies, includingAcacia Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:ACIA),Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) andNordstrom, Inc.(NYSE:JWN).Here's what you should know:Acacia Communications, Inc. (ACIA)Acacia Communications shares were hammered in the evening as the company released a forecastthat underwhelmed. The company reported earnings of $64.5 million, or $1.55 per share for its latest three-month period. Adjusted for stock-based compensations, Acacia posted earnings of 94 cents per share, well ahead of the 90 cents per share that analysts expected.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsRevenue was also better than what the consensus estimate called for as the company raked in $142.4 million. This figure was $2.7 million higher than the $139.7 million that Wall Street was calling for.However, ACIA stock took a massive hit as the company released a first-quarter forecast that will be about 70 cents per share. Analysts are calling for earnings of 78 cents per share.Revenue will be about $111 million, which is below the $137.3 million that analysts predict. The company only went public in May. ACIA shares are down some 14% in Friday's early trading.Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU)Baidu reported strong quarterly results thathelped drive the stock higher. For its fourth quarter, the company reported earnings of 4.13 billion yuan ($594.7 million), or $1.64 per American depositary share. On an adjusted basis, this figure was $1.91 per ADS. Analysts polled byFactSetwere calling for earnings of $1.09 per share.Revenue suffered a 2.6% setback year-over-year, coming in at $2.62 billion.

Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) Stock Looks Great After Q4 Earnings;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNordstrom, Inc.(NYSE:JWN) tumbled ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, but JWN stock is headed in the right direction once more after a better-than-expected result.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Pessar via Flickr (Modified)The short story: Profits looked good, revenues are still going, margins are showing signs of stabilization and cash flows are about to get a nice boost. Yet the valuation of JWN shares remains depressed, leading me to believe that Nordstrom stock is going to head higher.A lot higher.The Margin Story Is Getting BetterFirst, the headline numbers: Nordstrom earnings for Q4 came to $1.37 per share, easily beating estimates of $.122 per share. Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 2.4% year-over-year, but did fall shy of estimates for $4.37 billion.On the margin side, though, the story keeps getting better.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowSimilar toMacy's Inc.(NYSE:M) andKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS), JWN saw gross margins expand healthily in the quarter. Nordstrom, though, is significantly outperforming its mall peers. Retail gross profit rate increased more than 100 basis points in the quarter, versus 90 basis points at Macy's and 33 basis points and Kohl's. This is due to management's strong execution.Firstly, JWN is getting a handle on inventories. Sales growth outpaced inventory growth at Nordstrom by 500 basis points in Q4. Secondly, the company is putting an emphasis on private label brands. This provides a shield against mall-wide promotional activity. Going forward, gross margins should begin to experience some level of stabilization and maybe even steadily expand.Operating expense growth also really came down this year. Because the transition to a multi-channel business model required significant investment, JWN's operating expenses grew at 9% per year from 2010 to 2015. The investments paid off, and Nordstrom's e-commerce business now represents a fourth of overall sales (versus 8% in 2010).More importantly, though, this early digital success has been followed by less aggressive spend. Operating expenses only grew 4% this year. JWN management implied opex would grow at a lower rate over the next several years.In other words, the ""big"" spending era seems to be over. That means we might start to see some opex leverage over the next several years. Opex leverage plus buybacks would flow into earnings growth greatly in excess of 3 to 4% per year.Again, that isn't bad considering that JWN stock is trading at less than 15 times earnings.The Nordstrom BrandThe Nordstrom brand continues to underperform while Nordstrom Rack continues to outperform. This underscores the price sensitivity of the average JWN customer. That isn't great against the backdrop of intense price competition from other retailers.There are, though, several near-term catalysts which could re-spark growth in the full-priced business.Nordstrom is rolling out a new ""reserve merchandise"" mobile feature in 2017 to help drive full-priced sales. The Seattle pilot had tremendous success at a select few JWN stores, so there is upside for sales in 2017 behind greater mobile commerce engagement.Nordstrom's buy-online, pick-up-in-store program had a great 2016 with sales volume growth of 45%.The Canada business is only at $300 million in sales out of a $1 billion opportunity.JWN experienced 55% year-over-year growth this year in its Rewards member base to 7.8 million customers.Overall, JWN management is guiding for 3 to 4% revenue growth this year. That is an appropriate multiyear compounded growth rate. In other words, Nordstrom should be able to grow revenues around 3% to 4% per year over the next several years.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryThat isn't bad for a ""going-out-business"" department store. Especially considering that JWN stock trades at less than 15 times trailing earnings.Bright Cash Flow FutureThe end of the ""big"" spending era is also a significant boost to JWN cash flows. Despite margin compression and slower revenue growth, JWN posted exceptional cash flow metrics in 2016. Nordstrom's operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, far above the trailing 5-year average of $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, free cash flow was $550 million, also significantly higher than the trailing 5-year average.There are a couple things at play here.To adjust to lower sales growth, JWN management is keeping inventories down. This is significantly boosting operating cash flows. Moreover, Nordstrom decreased capital expenditures by 20% year-over-year. Both of these cash flow tailwinds are here to stay. JWN management is committed to tight inventory control, and capex will equal 4% of sales over the next several years versus 5% historically.All together, the company is positioned to see a strong boost in cash flows over the next five years.Bottom Line on JWN StockNordstrom sports a 3.3% dividend yield and only trades at 14.5 times trailing earnings. Revenue growth is positive, and will remain positive into the foreseeable future given robust e-commerce growth. Margins will stabilize in the near future, and earnings have a promising growth trajectory. Most importantly, the company is set to return more cash to shareholders than ever before.Drop Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Before It Drops YouThe stock traded around $60 per share just 2 months ago. The story today is a lot stronger than it was two months ago. From an investor standpoint, this is a good set-up for significant share price appreciation over the next several months.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Is Just Dying to Take Flight;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSeveral airline stocks that look interesting based on their charts, but there is one that particularly looks interesting to me as an options trader. That stock isUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMaybe I'm biased on UAL stock because I just booked a flight from Chicago to Miami on United. Or maybe it's just that airlines - includingAmerican Airlines Group Inc(NASDAQ:AAL) andDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) - have made double-digit gains since the beginning of November. There are several possible reasons behind this, including President Donald Trump promising to upgrade the air traffic control system and recent interest in the airlines from Warren Buffett.For those reasons and more, I like United stock, particularly via the trade idea below.The Trade SetupThe rationale: Taking a look at the chart below, United shares moved higher throughout the month of November before settling in and trading between about $70 and $76 since the beginning of December.Click to EnlargeIn addition, UAL stock has made several attempts to move through the $76 level, including several times this week. So far it has not been able to do so.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowI will be keeping an eye out for it in case it does for a bullish directional trade.How to Trade UAL Stock HereThe trade:Sell the UAL Mar $68/$70 put credit spread (selling the Mar $70 put and buying the $68 put) for 30 cents or better.The strategy:The maximum potential profit for this trade is 30 cents if UAL stock is trading at or above $70 at Mar expiration. The maximum loss is $1.70 ($2 - $0.30) or whatever credit was received for the spread if UAL stock is trading at or below $70 at Mar expiration. Breakeven is $69.70 at expiration based on a 30-cent credit.With all out-of-the-money (OTM) credit spreads like this trade, the risk is greater than the reward. The reason for this is because of the likelihood of profit. Essentially this trade has three out of four ways to profit. The stock can move higher, trade sideways or just stay above the breakeven point at expiration.For this trade idea to be successful and finish at max profit, the stock needs to stay above the $70 level by March monthly expiration. The low end of the channel needs to act as support like it has done since early December.Adding to the potential support for this trade, the 50-day simple moving average has moved up to the $74 area, and the stock is currently trading above that level.Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases FixWhat also makes this trade idea intriguing from an options perspective is the current implied volatility of the options. The current IV is above the historical volatility (HV) levels which may indicate the current premiums may be a little inflated.This is perfect for a credit trade on UAL stock.John Kmiecik is the head options instructor for Market Taker Mentoring, and co-author of the eBook 3 Secrets to Making Money in Any Market.

Finally,United States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) nosedived on news that President Donald Trump could delay his infrastructure spending plans until 2018.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)With analysts getting nervous about record highs across the board on Wall Street, downgrades were bound to arrive sooner or later. NVDA stock, one of the best performing tech stocks of 2016, emerged as the whipping boy, withInstinet,BMO Capital and Nomuraall downgrading the shares due to valuation concerns.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashNomura and Instinet both set a price target of $90, while BMO went further and set a target of $85.

NVDA is now trading well below all major March call open interest accumulations, and has even breached peak March put OI of 10,000-plus contracts at $100. The $95 strike is the next potential area of options-related support, with 7,700 puts in residence at this strike.Facebook Inc (FB)WhatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) did with the NFL, Facebook is looking to do with Major League Baseball. The social media giant is exploring adeal to stream one MLB game a weekon its website as part of a push to expand its video offerings. Facebook has experience streaming live events after streaming Mexican soccer games in English via a previous deal withUnivision.Options traders were quick to speculate on the deal, sending 397,000 contracts across the tape on Thursday. What's more, calls made up 69% of the day's take. The short-term options outlook for FB stock continues to lean bullish, as the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.78. Peak call OI for the series numbers more than 56,000 contracts at the $135 strike, which will trade out-of-the-money this morning if pre-market losses carry over into the open.United States Steel Corporation (X)U.S. Steel stock has surged more than 80% since the election on promises of $1 trillion in infrastructure spending from President Donald Trump. However, a report released yesterday indicated thatTrump may delay his infrastructure planuntil 2018, giving many investors in infrastructure reason to worry. As a result, X stock plunged more than 7.8% on Thursday and the shares are off another 2% in premarket action this morning.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryOptions activity was nearly divided on the shares, with calls eking out 54% of the 316,000 contracts traded yesterday. It will take more than one day of mixed activity to shake X options traders, however, as the short-term outlook remains heavily bullish. Specifically, the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.62, with calls on the verge of doubling puts among options set to expire within the next month.Peak call OI of 9,700 at the March $40 strike appears a bit out of reach at the moment, but the extended decline has made the March $35 and $36 strikes attractive to those looking for a rebound.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe postFriday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Facebook Inc (FB) and United States Steel Corporation (X)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases Fix;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf it seems as thoughApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been fighting with battery issues with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s for months, that's because it has.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere was a limited recall of iPhone 6s batteries blamed on a manufacturing issue, problems in China and recently reports of widespread iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues that seemed battery related. The company always denied any widespread issue.Until now.AAPL has finally acknowledged a problem related to the iPhone 6 battery … and says it has released a fix.The iPhone 6 Battery Has Been … ProblematicIf there's one thing 2016 will be remembered for when it comes to consumer electronics, it's the challenges of working with lithium-ion batteries.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissThe poster child for just how wrong this technology can go isSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung had a terrible 2016 after its flagship Galaxy Note 7's lithium-ion batteries were implicated in multiple fires, This led to a complete recall of the device, an estimated $10 billion hit, a seriously damaged reputation and anextensive investigation to pinpoint the cause.In comparison, AAPL's iPhone 6 battery woes have been less spectacular, but the cloud over Apple's previous two generations of phones has lasted just as long - if not longer. And they proved much more frustrating in terms of nailing down a cause, or a fix. That's because there appear to be multiple issues at play. And just as Apple admits there's a problem and announces a solution, another iPhone 6 battery issue seems to pop up.In 2016, Apple had to deal with aninvestigation in Chinaover reports that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s batteries were not only failing, but leaving the devices with expensive damage. Apple's findings pointed to cheap knock-off chargers as the culprit. Then there were reports of iPhone 6s phones unexpectedly shutting down. Apple eventually pinpointed the cause as being a manufacturing defect in a batch of batteries. Abattery exchange programwas launched, but that got off to a rocky start when Apple Stores were flooded by iPhone owners hoping for a replacement battery, and a backlog of repairs.Just as that mess was being sorted out, complaints began to rise of iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues. This was a new iPhone 6 battery issue and seemed to affect a growing number of users. It also affected the iPhone 6s, but not the iPhone 7.The problem got so bad that at one point in January, rumors started thatApple was planning to launch a full-scale iPhone 6 battery exchange program. However, AAPL continued to deny there was a widespread problem with iPhone and 6s batteries.Now, Apple has come clean.Apple Releases Fix for iPhone 6 Shutdown IssueThe company finally admitted that iPhone 6 and 6s phones have been suddenly and randomly shutting down, forcing owners to plug them into a charger before they can be restarted. But, AAPL says it released a fix and it's effective.In a statement released toTechCrunch, Apple says iOS 10.2.1 finally addresses the issue:""We're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.""So what happened?AAPL says the iPhone 6 battery (and in some cases the iPhone 6s as well) suffers from a limitation of all-lithium-ion batteries. As these batteries get older, they sometime deliver power unevenly. This could trigger the iPhone's power management system to force an emergency shutdown to protect the device.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple made changes to that system in iOS 10.2.1, essentially making it less sensitive to minor fluctuations. It also added new functionality so that should an iPhone 6 sudden shutdown occur, the user can restart their device without having to be connected to a charger. The company says it also will add a battery diagnostic screen to iOS that warns iPhone owners when their battery requires service.The fact this issue was directly related to aging lithium-ion batteries explains why it was the iPhone 6 battery being implicated more frequently than the 6s, why the numbers seemed to keep growing and why the iPhone 7 hasn't yet been affected.Will this mark the end of AAPL's drawn out iPhone 6 battery saga? The company has been playing whack-a-mole trying to identify issues with its lithium-ion batteries. But this fix seems to be enough of an umbrella solution that it may finally be able to put this chapter behind it.And let Apple go back to the good old days when complaints were limited to wishing the iPhone lasted longer on a battery charge …As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWWDC 2017: Here's What Apple Inc.

Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE): My Favorite ETF to Trade;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of my core strategies is relative value trading. This is the essence of the original hedge fund philosophy created by A.W. Jones - to buy a stock that is comparatively cheap and hedge by selling a highly correlated security that is comparatively expensive. One of my favorite ways to employ this strategy is by usingEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE) versus the price of oil.makeArticleAd();By having an underlying correlated commodity to use in my decision making, I gain an edge not found with other exchange-traded funds (ETFs).One of the main reasons I look to the XLE is the deep and liquid options market available in this ETF's options. As an options analyst, the ability to express a directional viewpoint, look from relative value situations, or hedge off risk using options is paramount.XLE provides tight bid/ask spreads along with considerable volume that is the hallmark of an effective trading vehicle.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsRight now, roughly 2,000 ETFs are listed for trading. Many of these have little to no volume and no options available-the so called roach motels. Others, such as heavyweights likeSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) or  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEARCA:DIA), are just too liquid and too big to provide any semblance of an edge. XLE provides the right balance of volume and edge to fit effectively in my trading philosophy.XLE is comprised of some of the biggest energy names, withExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM),Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) andSchlumberger Limited.(NYSE:SLB) comprising nearly 40% of the ETF weighting. As one would expect, it is closely correlated to the price of oil, withthree-month correlationsapproaching 70%.Click to EnlargeAs the chart shows, there have been occasions when the correlation breaks down. The blue areas area highlighted show instances when the XLE ETF was a relative outperformer to crude oil, along with the subsequent mean reversion shown in the reddish circles.We recently saw another divergence in mid-December of last year, as the gains in XLE once again got ahead of the smaller gains in oil.That divergence has begun to narrow. I would look for that convergence to continue over the coming weeks.How to Handle the XLEOne way to position would be to short XLE and go long oil futures orUnited States Oil Fund LP (ETF)(NYSEARCA:USO). However, as a word of caution, USO is designed for only short-term holding and hedging periods.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryA similar strategies using options could be to sell a bearish out-of-the-money call spread on XLE and also sell a bullish out of the money put spread on USO.For those looking to add another tool to your trading toolbox, using the XLE versus oil can provide the edge that allows you to put on a profitable hedge.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous Territory;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped sharply on Thursday following the company's latest financial results. Tesla saw a narrower-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter and revenue rose almost 90% on a year-over-year basis. However, TSLA stock holders seemed to focus on the company's still-increasing cash burn rate that now raises ""concern"" for a new capital raise.makeArticleAd();As a result of Thursday's 6.45% selloff, the near- to possibly intermediate-term path of least resistance now appears to point lower.In the bigger picture, Tesla stock remains constructively positioned. And I believe shares ultimately will provide further gains for long-term investors. But for now, even bulls might have to wear their bear costumes.When I last discussed TSLA stock onDec. 16, I offered that the stock increasingly looked ready to move higher off the lower end of its bigger-picture trading range with a near-term upside target around the $215 area. This upside price target was reached just a few days later as the stock rallied a quick 8%.As a quick reminder before looking at the charts (and because yesterday I received some questions around this): How much money TSLA loses each quarter at this stage does not matter nearly as much as the rate of change in its car production and sales.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThat is the basic definition of a growth stock. And Tesla is a growth stock.TSLA Stock ChartsLooking at Tesla shares through the lens of their multiyear weekly chart, we see that TSLA has spent the majority of the past couple years bouncing around in a wide trading range that for the most part spans from around $180 on the lower end to about $285 on the upper end.Click to EnlargeJust last week, TSLA stock once again bumped into the upper end of this range, where it thus far has been promptly rejected. Note also that the most recent ascent over the past couple of months has seen the stock rally from the lower end to the upper end of this range in a straight shot.This very fact makes a sustainable breakout above this range in the near-term most unlikely due to the stock's near- to intermediate-term overbought readings.Also, a sideways consolidation or possibly a mean-reversion move to the middle of the aforementioned trading range at this juncture looks likely.On the daily chart, we see that with Thursday's selling, TSLA stock not only broke below its steady, nearly three-month-long uptrend, but also below its 21-day simple moving average (yellow).Click to EnlargeNote also that the up-gap on Feb. 9 (blue arrow) was negated by yesterday's down-gap, thus also forming what we may refer to as an ""island top"" formation.Buy This Nvidia Corporation Dip for Free Right NowAll of these three developments are bearish for TSLA stock as it relates to the near to possibly intermediate-term. The path of least resistance now looks to point toward the $240 area as a next downside target.Traders and active investors could look to initiate short trading positions either through Tesla stock or its options.As always, any strong daily bullish reversal would be a stop-loss signal.Like what you see?

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Has Big Prospects Despite Its Problems;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a bittersweet victory, to be sure. Just whenQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) starts to unveil a game-changing technology, a legal hurricane starts to make landfall. If any current or would-be owners of QCOM stock are torn as to what the future likely holds, there's good reason.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrAnd yet, as much jeopardy as the company's bottom line may be in at this time, the fact that Qualcomm stock is still down more than 25% over the past three years suggests the market saw a litigation headwind coming sooner or later. The worst-case scenario may already be priced into QCOM stock, which means the recent weakness makes for a compelling entry point.The BadThe legal wrangling is mostly withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Apple be successful with its effort, it opens the door to other litigation, not to mention emboldens a similar case being brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission.The short version of the story: Apple (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all arguing the same thing - Qualcomm's business model of licensing its technologies to phonemakers isnot only exorbitant, but unlawfully stifles competition. That's a legal no-no in most any country. The Korea Fair Trade Commission isseeking $873 million for essentially the same.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM has lost this argument before. In 2015, thecompany forked over $975 million to Chinafor breaking that country's antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedly charging all-encompassing licensing feesto phonemakers that may or may not have needed access to all of the technology in that IP package… another dubious practice.Years of sharp dealing have finally caught up with Qualcomm.The GoodThe irony is, while the company was over-milking its aging patent portfolio, QCOM was also developing some new - and highly marketable - intellectual property.The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting one, but the reality is, the technology and bandwidth needed to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. This week, Qualcommunveiled its 802.11ax technology, which can carry four times the amount of data current Wi-Fi technology carries, but without using any more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technologies VP Rahul Patel explained:It is taking Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experience point of view. What it is trying to do is prepare the Wi-Fi network, which in many cases is experiencing a lot of congestion, largely because the network is becoming dense and is not able to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the company has created a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connection between a mobile phone's modem and the transceiver. Not only is it a superior solution to current alternatives, it's a simpler solution that works with a variety of connection protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the utilization of modem intelligence.They're not the kind of advances the average consumer cares about, or even understands. With 5G connectivity about to become the norm, however, these little advances are actually big advances that phonemakers will desperately need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the future of QCOM stock lies somewhere between the two ends of this good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm's business model of leveraging an aging patent portfolio - and doing so in a questionable manner - is going to falter. If the company wants to continue being an IP player, it's going to need some new IP.The question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platforms be enough? It matters, simply becausethe company's licensing and royalty revenue is roughly twice its revenue from outright chip sales.3 Stocks That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeThe answer to this question is a qualified yes; the qualification is the speed with which lawsuits will result in a decision, and the time that will be needed for IoT and 5G to reach critical mass. Odds are good the former will hurt before the latter helps, meaning Qualcomm could be headed for a dry spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-termer who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreciate the potential of the distant future now…after a few years of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropriate for grandma's retirement portfolio, but there's little doubt the company's new technologies will be crucial to the next generation of connectivity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

In the   company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the Model 3   didn't look like it would ""require"" a capital raise, but the CEO   was also careful to emphasize that this didn't mean Tesla   shouldn't tap into debt or equity opportunities in order to help   create ""a larger buffer and to derisk the business.""But a capital raise appears all but certain now, based on   Musk's comments during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call   on Wednesday.[T]his is really a question of, 'What's the risk tolerance     of the company, or how close to the edge do we want to go?'     According to our financial plan, capital needs to be raised for     the Model 3, but we get very close to the edge. So, then that's     probably not the best thing for shareholders on a risk-adjusted     basis. So, we're considering a number of options, but I think     it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk.A capital raise in 2017 comes after the company had indicated   in August in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission   related to its acquisition of SolarCity that it was planning to   raise funds by the end of 2016, ""including through potential   equity or debt offerings.""The filing explained:Such additional funds would be used primarily for tooling,     production equipment and construction of the Tesla's Model 3     production lines, equipment to support cell production at     Tesla's Gigafactory, as well as new Tesla retail locations,     service centers and Supercharger locations and general     corporate purposes. Secondarily, if the Merger with SolarCity     is completed, a portion of the additional funds would also be     used to support the additional capital needs of the Combined     Company.With these same statements remained even in an Oct. 7 filing   with the SEC, investors assumed the company planned to raise   capital during the fourth quarter.But Tesla ended up deciding todelay a capital raiseas record fourth-quarter deliveries helped the company reporta rare profit, improving Tesla's cash position.In retrospect, if Tesla opts to raise capital through equity   instead of debt, delaying a capital raise looks like it will pay   off for shareholders by significantly mitigating shareholder   dilution.Tesla stockis up more than 30% since October.Image source: author.Big spending on the wayWhile Tesla's cash position improved again between the   company's third and fourth quarter, increasing by over $300   million to $3.4 billion, raising capital would make sense ahead   of the company's plans for aggressive spending ahead of Model 3.   Tesla said it plans to invest between $2 billion and $2.5 billion   in capital in the first half of 2017 as it prepares to bring   Model 3 to market in July. With $1.3 billion in capital   expenditures during the entire year of 2016, this represents a   significant jump in the pace of Tesla's capital spending.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Fell After Earnings;2/23/2017;"Shares of TeslaTSLAwere down more than 5% in morning trading Thursday after the company posted a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss. Despite Elon Musk's assurance that his company's affordable Model 3 sedan is still on schedule, investors are remaining cautious about several other key things that Tesla revealed on Wednesday afternoon.Earnings PerformanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Tesla posted an adjusted loss of $1.25 per share, missing our estimate of a loss of $1.19 per share. Nevertheless, this figure was significantly improved from the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.44 per share.Tesla said that it delivered 22,252 cars in the quarter, which was down 10% from the third quarter but up about 27% year-over-year. The company saw 49% more global net orders for the Model S and Model X combined, and it expects to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 of these cars in the first half of 2017. This would represent year-over-year growth of 61% to 71%, giving Tesla some strong momentum as it begins production on the Model 3 in July.(Also Read:Tesla Posts Strong Revenues Despite Q4 Loss, Global Net Orders Up 49%)Tesla also posted strong revenues, with fourth-quarter sales figures of $2.28 billion comfortably beating our consensus estimate of $2.201 billion and growing 88.4% year-over-year. The company benefitted from about six weeks of revenue from SolarCity, a solar energy services company is acquired in November.The Good, The Bad, The UglyAlthough Tesla's earnings inconsistency continues, its revenue beat and vehicle sales growth should be encouraging. The more optimistic Tesla investors will also cling to Elon Musk's latest updates regarding the production of the Model 3.As mentioned above, the Model 3 is slated to begin production in July, and the $35,000 car is expected to help move Tesla into a wider market that targets the average driver. Musk expects to make about half a million cars in 2018, and his expectations are based on the idea that improvements in manufacturing will help his company reach that goal.""The Model 3 is designed for manufacturing,"" Musk said. ""It's a very compelling car, and we understand manufacturing a lot better than we did in the past.""Of course, not everything was rainbows and butterflies for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Besides its earnings miss, investors are also punishing Tesla for its increased capital expenditures related to the Model 3.Musk did mention that the company does not actually need to raise more capital for the Model 3, but he did admit that things were ""very close to the edge"" and ""it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce the risk.""Investors are obviously hesitant about any new spending from Tesla, which seems to be perpetually burning cash on its new projects. The company also put some more uncertainty in the air with a separate announcement about a big changeup in management.According to a companyblog post, Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler will be departing the company in April. Tesla said that Wheeler, who joined the company about 15 months ago, is leaving to pursue opportunities in public policy.Wheeler will be replaced by Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's first ever CFO and a former FordFvehicle line controller. Ahuja already has about seven years of experience at Tesla, having maneuvered the company away from near bankruptcy in 2008.Bottom LineLong story short, I don't think we know much more about Tesla than we did before the release of the report. Sure, Musk reassured us that the Model 3 is on schedule, but investors have learned to take his time-based promises with a grain of salt.The big picture for Tesla is still the same. The company has the potential to change the world. But it burns lots of cash and profits seem a long way out.Stocks that Aren't in the News.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChoosing between buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.The Case for AAPL StockNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead,services now drivethe stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than$12 billioninto capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.AAPL hadover $246 billion in cashon its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.The Case for GOOGL StockThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.Alphabet has become acash flow monster, delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.The Bottom LineIt's hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both companies are likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) was in the 1950s,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) was in the last decade. These are their good old days. We know they will end someday, but that day is not today.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

NVDA stock has been on a monstrous run for a while. That's because we live in a tech-driven world, and more aspects of our lives are becoming completely tech-dependent - big drivers for this chip company.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWant proof of how ubiquitous this trend is? We're talking about self-driving cars going into mainstream use within just a few years.Nvidia, and chip titansIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), are among the very few companies who supply the brains for this new techie globe. So for the long-term, shorting NVDA stock should turn out to be a bad idea. Many have tried to short it and lost. Last December, I actually shared a profitable bearish article onhow to short NVDA stock for free- a rare winner on the bear side of things.Today, amid what is a huge dip in Nvidia stock, I want to set a longer-dated trade that bets NVDA will not, in fact, collapse.The thesis here is that the fundamentals are solid enough that they will invite buyers to defend the stock on dips. Technically, I see potential risk down to $90 per share. But luckily, the options markets are flexible enough to allow for trades with apt buffer zones.Click to EnlargeThanks to contracts dispersion, I can bend time and put it to work in my favor by selling risk against levels I deem safe.How to Trade NVDA Stock HereThe Bet:Sell the NVDA Sep $70/$65 credit put spread for 85 cents per contract to open. The 30% buffer from current price gives this trade an 80% theoretical chance of success based on today's metrics. If successful, this trade yields over 15% on money risked.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings.

But by selling naked puts, I commit to owning the stock at that price if Nvidia stock falls through it.Usually I like to hedge my trades, but in this case I will refrain for now. I believe that the longer-dated aspect of this trade allows me the flexibility to manage the risk appropriately should more downside come. Defense strategies could include credit call spreads or cheap shorter-term debit put spreads.Conversely, someone who wants to be more bullish NVDA stock can use the proceeds from selling the credit put spreads to set another bullish trade.Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Once thought to be a good candidate for both T-Mobile andSprint Corp(NYSE:S), it appears as though T-Mobile has the inside track, which should hurt Sprint stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrOr does it?Negotiations are not taking place right now because competing bidders in the FCC's spectrum auction aren't allowed to communicate with each other, and won't be until the auction ends in the near future.Thus, any tie-up at the moment is pure fantasy - a game that Sprint stock analysts and media (including myself) seem all too ready to play.T-Mobile and DishT-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out the rationale for DISH seeking a wireless partner at the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.""Rumors for years that (Dish is) getting into wireless, it's a declining TV business and it has a big pile of spectrum. This is going to run its course in 2017,""Legere told the CES audience. ""By the end of 2017, Dish will not be a standalone entity. So dealer, next hand of cards. Charlie (Dish CEO Charlie Engren), thanks for playing.""Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.T-Mobile just deliveredstrong fourth-quarter profitsthat beat analyst expectations. Adding more than 8 million subscribers for the third consecutive year, four wireless carriers is proving to be good for consumers, making a T-Mobile/Sprint tie-up less likely to get approval from the Trump administration.So, DISH either saddles up to T-Mobile or Sprint.Wireless expert Mark Lowenstein believes that the wireless companies will ultimately need the cable companies as much as they currently need wireless.""Owning Charter will help Verizon's in 5G, and getting to a more critical mass in broadband homes provides Verizon with more options in a hybrid fixed/mobile broadband world,""Lowenstein recently wrote in FierceWireless. ""The worlds of cable and wireless will ultimately merge in some form.""Therefore, in his opinion (and I tend to agree), it makes perfect sense for T-Mobile to merge with Dish Network or Charter.However, given T-Mobile and Dish already had merger discussions back in 2015 - which failed due to valuation concerns - Legere and Engren are already familiar with each other and the sticking points from previous negotiations, making a deal more likely a second time around.Plus, ifVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is in fact interested in acquiringCharter Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:CHTR), T-Mobile is less likely to be able to pull off such a deal even with the backing of parentDeutsche Telekom AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:DTEGY).T-Mobile and Dish would be more a merger of equals, if there was such a thing.Sprint Stock Could Be Left in the ColdThat leaves Sprint potentially out in the cold, an outcome that would absolutely kill Sprint stock, making Charter the natural partner, a move that could seeSoftbank Group Corp(OTCMKTS:SFTBF) founder Masayoshi Son become the largest shareholder in a combined entity.Currently, Softbank ownsowns 83% of Sprint, while over at Charter, John Malone'sLiberty Broadband Corp(NASDAQ:LBRDK)owns 25.6%.Sprint has a market value of $36.6 billion, while Charter's enterprise value is $99.1 billion; put the two together and Son's share of the merged company works out to 30.4%, compared to 25.4% for Liberty Broadband, despite Charter being the larger company.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThere's only one problem with this calculation: It doesn't provide a premium for either company, and that's where negotiations could get very tricky.John Malone knows a thing or two about dealmaking so he's likely to drive a hard bargain when it comes to whom owns whom. Meanwhile, Son could argue thatComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) is just ashungry for a wireless business- it has set up a mobile division and isbidding on spectrum- and could make a better fit, given its existing partnership with Sprint.At the end of the day, both Sprint and Charter need each other more than Comcast needs either of them, so unless something happens that prevents T-Mobile and DISH from coming together, Charter is the best bet for Sprint stock at this moment.However, that could change very quickly once the shoes start to drop.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Tied Hip-and-Thigh to TrumpThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postSprint Corp (S) Stock's Best Bet: Charter Communications, Inc.

Is SunPower Coming Up Roses in Residential Solar?;2/23/2017;"AmidSunPower Corporation's(NASDAQ: SPWR) struggles over the past year, including the   fourth quarter of 2016 in particular, the company may finally be   showing some promise in residential solar, a business long   dominated byTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) .Customers are now starting to shun the long-term contracts   that come with leases, choosing to pay cash or take out loans for   their solar systems. And when they begin to make their own   choices about solar equipment, SunPower's high efficiency,   superior quality, and good aesthetics have led to rising market   share. Which of course begs the question: Is this a sustainable   win that SunPower can build off for years to come?Image source: SunPower.makeArticleAd();Why SunPower is different in residential solarSunPower has a few key differentiators from installers like   Tesla, Vivint, and Sunrun. The first is that it sells through a   dealer network rather than doing sales and installation directly.   That means SunPower can sell a dealer panels, complete solutions   like Equinox, and lease financing, or any combination of the   three. It has also built out loan partners, allowing dealers to   offer lease, loan, and cash sales, whereas national competitors   still have an incentive to push customers to leases.The second differentiation is SunPower's high efficiency solar   panels. The X-Series solar panel now averages 25% efficiency on a   cell level, meaning panels are likely 23%-23.5% efficient,   exceeding even high efficiency competitors by 300 basis points or   more.The Equinox solution, which includes micro inverters and   racking, is also a differentiator, making it more cost effective   to install X-Series panels. And there's growing evidence that   SunPower's strategy is winning.Evidence SunPower is winningThe past year has been really terrible for most residential   solar companies. Sales have been harder to come by and the market   has transitioned away from national installers and leases to   smaller installers and loans or cash sales. But that plays into   SunPower's hands, and the company says it's now in the #2   position in the residential solar market.The moves to smaller installers, away from leases, and toward   higher efficiency all play in SunPower's favor. And that should   lead to growing sales and continued strong margins, which   management said were around 20% when you pull out one-time   restructuring charges.What comes nextThe interesting dynamic heading into 2017 is that customers   are moving toward local and regional installers, but battery   systems are going to become more common on the market. And the   development and smart controls behind a battery system will   require a large company to drive the economic benefits batteries   can bring.This could put SunPower in an enviable position, supplying   products and technology to local and regional installers while   still having the ability to control energy storage at a corporate   level, creating virtual power plants or individualized charge and   discharge cycles depending on local rate structures. These are   capabilities Tesla and Sunrun are starting to offer, but they   come with their own installation infrastructure and don't give   customers the same equipment or financing choice as SunPower's   dealer network.It's possible that SunPower could be well positioned in energy   storage as well, although it hasn't released a full strategy   given the small size of the market. But if it does, residential   solar could go from a point of strength within the business to a   driver of value for the company long-term.What to watch forIf the strategy I laid out above is a real winner for   SunPower, we should see MW deployed in residential solar rise,   revenue from residential solar grow, and margins remain over 20%   and potentially trend higher over time.Given the fact this is the one bright spot for earnings right   now, it's very possible management will be able to leverage   residential solar growth in the future. That's the surest way to   get back to profitability given the challenges in commercial and   utility markets lately.10 stocks we like better than SunPowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Tied Hip-and-Thigh to Trump;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNo stock you can buy today is more closely tied to the fate of the Trump Administration thanExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Since the November election its CEO has been whisked off to become Secretary of State, while the company he left behind has doubled-down on policies aligned with those of the new Administration.Thismakes Exxon a must-own, according to some analysts. ""It is hard to imagine a better scenario"" for Exxon than a Trump administration, writes Martin Tiller of Oilprice.If Tiller is right, XOM stock is a bargain at below $83 per share, its opening price on Feb. 15. The 75 cents per share dividend delivers a yield of 3.62% and the future should be looking bright.The price is low because of a recent earnings miss but the shortfall was mainly due to a one-time write-off of natural gas assets. Exxon plans to boost spending.Betting on More Oil and GasExxon Mobil is taking the administration's call to increase production seriously. Its$6.6 billion purchaseof Permian Basin assets controlled by the Bass Family means it should be able to deliver oil profitably for 20 years to come, at current prices.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsThe company is also moving ahead globally, benefiting fromthe end of a rulethat made companies disclose foreign bribes.Exxon is a big player in Iraq, and Tillerson may be the only person alive who can make that work, getting around the Administration's travel ban and Trump's comments that the U.S. should have seized the country's oil in 2003 when it had the chance.Shareholders have also approved XOM'spurchase ofInteroil, a producer of oil and gas off Papua New Guinea, with a lot of undeveloped acreage and one of the region's biggest gas finds that is already producing.This should leverage the company even more than it has been to the price of oil, which has risen from about $45 per barrel to $53 since Trump's election. Natural gas is also flirting with a three-handle, or $3 per mcf, after trading closer to $2 per mcf last November.Target on Its BackThere remain big risks for Exxon Mobil bulls. Exxon's big bets have put a target on its back, highlighted by the resignation of environmentalist Sarah Labowitz from a company advisory board. The company has responded to the threat by naming a climate scientist, Susan Avery, to its board of directors but that will not be enough for its opponents.Exxon also faces the perennial risk of having too much of a good thing.Just as its gains are leveraged to rising oil prices, overproduction could cause the stock's price to fall. Add to that the natural risks attendant to owning refineries, and the present bargain in Exxon Mobil stock may not last.The Bottom Line on XOM StockI would be more attracted investing in Exxon Mobil stock if the Trump Administration's month-plus record so far didn't read more likea Carl Hiassen novelthan a Tom Clancy one.The company has enormous potential but it cuts both ways. The shares now sell for little more than they did in 2007. While the dividend has doubled, revenues have continued to decline for the last three years.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.If we are on the cusp of a new oil boom, XOM stock will be a prime beneficiary. It's well positioned to profit from even $53 per barrel oil. But how long will the good times last as costs for renewable energy continue to fall, making it harder for developing nations to justify the infrastructure investment needed to make oil and gas look cheap by comparison?Exxon Mobil may be a good trade, and it may have a few good years ahead of it, but the longer-term looks cloudy and Trump won't be president forever.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJust think ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) as a Rorschach test. You know - the pictures of random ink blots psychiatrists show you to see what your subconscious mind's got going on. See, if you wanted to see TSLA stock in a bearish light, you could do that. Or, if you wanted to see it in a bullish light, the Tesla earnings report posted Wednesday evening could just as easily facilitate that stance.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FlickrThere was good and bad in it.Most of the market chose to see the glass as half empty for TSLA stock, by the way, with shares in the red to the tune of over 5% early on Thursday.Nevertheless, even today's naysayers have to acknowledge there were some encouraging glimmers of hope nestled in last quarter's numbers.Tesla Stock Earnings for Q4For the quarter ending in December, Teslareported an operating loss of 69 cents per shareon revenue of $2.28 billion. Analysts were only calling for a top line of $2.19 billion, but those same analysts were also calling for a loss of only 43 cents per share of TSLA stock.The comparison to the fourth-quarter figures from the prior year are similarly split. In the same quarter a year earlier, Teslalost $2.02 per shareon revenue of $1.21 billion.Of course, adding to the fog that obscured the company's true health is the fact thatthe $2.6 billion acquisitionof loss-making SolarCity was officially closed in late November, adding to Tesla's top line, but subtracting from the bottom line. The Tesla earnings report explained that the solar power outfit added $77 million worth of cash to the books, but also added $85 million in expenses.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowStill, the post-acquisition picture is a blurry one, with the root cause of the swing back to a loss after Q3's profit not necessarily being solely attributable to the SolarCity deal. Even the official SEC filing only offers modest details in broad categorizations ""automotive,"" ""energy generation and storage"" and ""services and other.""TSLA Highlight/LowlightsWhile details were minimal, it's worth noting gross margins for the energy generation and storage division swungfrom -4.1% in the third quarter to 2.7% for the fourth quarter, while gross margins for the automotive arm - on a GAAP basis - shrunk from 29.4% in Q3 to only 22.6% in Q4. The gross margin rate on services flipped from a positive 4.8% to a negative 11.3% during the quarter.All the changes in margin figures reflect the fact that this is a company in transition from being one thing to being something else, and something much bigger than it was - hence the challenge in finding meaning in the quarterly report.All the same, cars remain Tesla's core business, accounting for $1.99 billion worth of last quarter's $2.28 billion in revenue. It sold a total of 22,252 vehicles last quarter, down from 24,821 deliveries during the third quarter. It made, though, 24,882 electric cars during Q4, versus 25,185 completed assemblies for Q3. All those figures were far and away better than year-ago levels.Preparation and reconfiguration for the Model 3 may have been a production distraction … and not a cheap one. The companyincurred $522 million in CapEx last quarter, most of which was spent on preparations for Model 3 production.Cash flow went negative to the tune of $236 million during the fourth quarter.Looking Ahead for TSLA StockOne of those sources of the aforementioned expansion will be, of course, the launch of the Model 3 - the electric car for the masses sporting a sticker price of only $35,000. CEO Elon Musk had previously said the company intends to begin production of the vehicle in July, and reach its maximum output pace of 5,000 of the cars per week during the fourth quarter of this year.Musk reiterated that timeframeon Wednesday.In the meantime, the company expects to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 electric vehicles during the first half of 2017 following a record number of orders for the Model S and Model 3 received during the last quarter of last year. Tesla didn't offer any revenue or earnings guidance.How to Trade Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock for 150% UpsideThe company did, however, answer a question many shareholders has silently asking themselves - yes,Tesla is apt to issue more debt or more TSLA stock to raise funds. Musk said the organization could likely afford not to, but doing so presents a potential liquidity risk. The news of the likely fundraising is probably the biggest reason TSLA stock fell in the wake of last quarter's earnings report.More than anything though, owning Tesla stock remains an adventure in gauging how traders willfeelabout the rhetoric, as the results continue to tell us little about the future health of the company.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWeibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 Earnings7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings.

Tax Reform by August? The Market Abides;2/23/2017;"Thursday, February 23, 2017makeArticleAd();The Dow keeps on rolling, now for nine straight days worth of gains. Lately, we'd seen pre-market activity try to pump the brakes a bit, opening normal trading days slightly to the negative or right around break-even. But the animal spirits would eventually return again, continually posting all-time highs. It's been a good time to be a market bull.Futures look stronger early Thursday than they have earlier in the week, bolstered by another healthy Jobless Claims report. Also, an interview CNBC gave to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin this morning illustrated the Trump administration's concentrated interest on passing tax reform through Congress. Mnuchin established a timeline - before the August recess - to enact pro-business tax reform measures that promise to be the most significant since the Reagan administration.Less clear were the issues regarding border taxes and what the Treasury expects to do about a strengthening dollar in the global economy, which looks to cut into U.S. competitiveness. But an August timetable for tax reform - which has already been at least somewhat priced into the market - is proving to have a positive effect on today's early trading.Initial Jobless Claims rose by 6000 last week from the previous week to a still-strong 244K. For the past few weeks we've seen another ratcheting down in jobless claims, from the 250-275K we saw for much of 2016 to perhaps a 225-250K for the near future. Continuing claims fell from 2.08 million two weeks ago to 2.06 million last week, also historically low though still slightly above the 2 million mark we saw briefly not too long ago. More good news.Fed minutes seem to indicate more willingness to raise interest rates another quarter point at the FOMC's March meeting, but the jury is still out. Jobs numbers of late show a labor market tightening, so if we see economic data pointing to stronger inflation metrics, this will probably boost the likelihood of a March hike even further. If not, then not. But even a range of 75-100 basis points wouldn't throw a wet blanket on this hot market, at least not too much.Tesla MotorsTSLAmissed Q4 estimates after yesterday's close, but orders are way up - nearly 50% - for Model S and Model X cars. And the Model 3, Tesla's least expensive sedan with a price tag of $35K, remains on track for a July launch, which should bolster company revenues, which did surpass expectations in Q4.For more on Tesla's earnings report, check here.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Has Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Finally Hit the Bottom?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was ever a company that needs good news, and good newsnow, it would beFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT). Immediately after its introduction to the retail market, FIT made a pronounced impact on the health and wellness sector. More importantly, it became a cultural phenomenon thanks to the company's quirky advertisements. But in the financial markets, Fitbit stock has lacked.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitSure, Wall Street piled into Fitbit stock during its initial public offering honeymoon phase. Between June 18 until Aug. 5 of 2015, FIT stock gained an extremely impressive 74%. Unfortunately, that only covers 34 trading days. Since then, Fitbit stock has become the antithesis of its consumer base: lethargic, unmotivated and … well, something that rhymes with ""FIT.""But with the once on-fire consumer tech firm releasing its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 results, will fortune shine on Fitbit stock?Just by looking at the hard numbers, I wouldn't hold my breath.Tough Earnings for Fitbit to SwallowFitbit reported aQ4 lossof $146.3 million. Although the fact that FIT went into the red wasn't a surprise, the magnitude certainly was. On a per share basis, Fitbit stock was expected by Wall Street analysts to mitigate negativity to 48 cents. Instead, losses adjusted for one-time gains and costs resulted in 56 cents of red ink.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe top line didn't impress, either. For Q4, forecasted revenue averaged $575.8 million. In actuality, FIT stock managed $573.8 million, or a negative surprise of a little more than 0.3%. The margin of the miss isn't so bad in and of itself. However, with so many critics taking aim at Fitbit stock, the company needed something spectacular on this front. Whatever this is, it just isn't going to do the trick.Although it's not fair, the Fitbit earnings miss is exaggerated due to the fact that it's the first one. According toCNBC's archives, prior to yesterday's earnings report, the device maker leveraged an averageearnings surpriseof 103%.One of the most prominent criticisms came from Jim Cramer. Appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" segment late last month, Cramer suggested that FIT was acommoditized company. Once people buy the product, there is no compelling reason to buy again. And when you consider the sharp erosion in sales growth, it's hard not to see this point.To illustrate, quarter-over-quarterrevenue growthin 2015 was 170%. In 2016, it has dropped to an alarming 25%!Since they're not killing it on profitability margins, FIT has drastic actions to take. At least to that end, management is making the right moves.Easing the Minds of Fitbit Stock BuyersLast month, FIT announced aseries of layoffs, which will affect about 10% of the total workforce. The tech firm is hoping to save $200 million, which is a huge deal for its size.We also have to reconsider this criticism of Fitbit stock as a ""commoditized"" investment. It's both a valid and an invalid argument. You can literally say the same thing aboutApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE). That hasn't stopped them from making smart phones, tablets and cameras. The latter is a particularly good example of a widely distributed product continuing to find solid demand.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making a Giant Push in Its Supercharger NetworkIt shouldn't come as no surprise that we live in a disposable world. Many of us couldn't fathom driving the same car for more than three or four years. As long as FIT stock remains an innovation investment first, I don't care about ancillary titles like commoditized.And the company has a strong user base. Build those numbers, and Fitbit Inc can turn that frown upside down.Finally, there is something to be said about hitting rock bottom. Fitbit is sitting at breakeven despite what otherwise was apretty lousy reportthat also included negative guidance.The bearishness seems completely priced in. I'm not guaranteeing a floor, but there are enough positives for Fitbit stock to begin recovering from here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Xcerra, Aaron and Tesla highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/23/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 23, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsXcerra(NASDAQ:XCRA-Free Report) as the Bull of the DayAaron(NYSE:AAN-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:Xcerra (NASDAQ:XCRA-Free Report) just pulled off a triple play of sorts. The company reported earnings and beat on top, beat on bottom and raised guidance. I love to see stocks beat and raise as these stocks tend to outperform for the next several months. Normally when I see a stock beat and raise, it becomes a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but this stock already held the coveted Rank before the report. Now it is the Bull of the Day.Recent Earnings ReportXCRA beat the Zacks Consensus of a loss of $0.02 by $0.08 when they reported a gain of $0.06 for the most recent quarter. Revenues came in at $80.1M and that was ahead of the $78.9M estimate and represented growth of 10.8% from year ago levels.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1Company DescriptionXcerra Corporation engages in designing, manufacturing, and marketing automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry. Its product portfolio includes Diamond platform; X-Series platform; and ASL platform. The Company also offers various services, such as installation and maintenance of test systems, servicing of spare parts, parts and labor warranties on test systems and instruments, and training on the maintenance and operation of test systems. Xcerra Corporation, formerly known as LTX-Credence Corporation, is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts.Guiding HigherThe company said the next three months are going to be better than what was previously expected. They guided EPS to a range of $0.10 - $0.14 compared to an $0.08 estimate. Revenues are expected to be $95M - $99M compared to the $89.75M estimate.Further, in the press release the company noted they plan to ship a record number of Diamondx systems during the current quarter.EstimatesThe beat is pretty fresh and all the reports are clearly not in yet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is holding still at $0.22 as is the estimate for 2018 at $0.56.To me, this means that estimates have not yet moved and we could be in for a big surprise.Bear of the Day:Aaron's (NYSE:AAN-Free Report) recently beat the Wall Street estimate when the company reported earnings on February 17. The company earned $0.50 per share and that was $0.05 ahead of the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.45.Revenues came in at $795M, down 3.2% from the year ago period and below the consensus estimate of $814.8M.Taken together, the revenue miss and earnings beat would probably be a forgivable sin and it certainly would not make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). So why did the Rank fall?GuidanceThe company guided Wall Street below its expectations, and that means that estimates are going to fall. The company said they expect FY2017 EPS of between $2.15 - $2.40 when Wall Street was looking for $2.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 slipped from $2.47 to $2.28 over the last seven days and there was also a big move lower for the 2018 number. It moved from $2.80 to $2.68.Not all the estimates are in yet, with a few analysts yet to report back. This could mean that estimates move lower from their already beaten up position.Company DescriptionAaron's is engaged in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories. It is engaged in the lease ownership, lease and retail sale of a variety of products, such as widescreen and LCD televisions, computers, living room and bedroom furniture, and refrigerators The company offers products of various brands, such as JVC, Mitsubishi, Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Simmons, Frigidaire, and Sharp. Aaron's, Inc. is based in Atlanta, Georgia.Closing StoresThe company noted that they closed 61 stores in the fourth quarter of 2016. On top of that they also see another 70 stores to close in 2Q17. Logically, the lower number of stores could lead to lower sales in the future.Guidance for sales was inline, with the company projecting $3.1B - $3.31B when the Wall Street Estimate was calling for $3.26B.Efficiency better increase per store if AAN is going to meet the sales goals.Additional content:Tesla Posts Strong Revenues Despite Q4 Loss, Global Net     Orders Up 49%Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)just released its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results, posting earnings, before non-recurring items, of a loss of $1.25 per share and revenues of $2.28 billion.

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?;2/23/2017;"I bought a used car recently, and a few days after I brought   it home, a friend asked me, ""Do you think this is the last car   you'll ever buy?""We talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where   he was going with his question. He was hinting at the   fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing   services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in   the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy   one.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();By 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on   the road worldwide with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in   their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and   slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as little as $20,000.And as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become   ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and   opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.Automakers are investing in this futureTo understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a   world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no   further than what the automakers themselves are doing.Elon Musk's recently updated version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA)  master plan includes details on a new   service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by   2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to   allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out   by other people.As Musk wrote:You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared     fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have     it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,     significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the     monthly loan or lease cost.Image source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of   driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand   for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that    ""you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you   are."" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor   even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where   Musk sees his automaker headed.And just in case think this mentality is unique to the   innovative Tesla, consider whatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM)  is doing. The giant automaker launched a   ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM   owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The   cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a   first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own   cars.In a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25   million of its customers around the world will use some form of   shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as ""a key element of   our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive   industry."" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in   just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57   million miles of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is   developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear   that it intends to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car paired   with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The   company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in   several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles   this year.Other automakers are moving in this direction as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is working withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100   self-driving minivans that will be the basis for aride-hailing serviceset to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the   service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical   role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in   the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.Will this really end car ownership?It's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course.   After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous   vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of   ride-hailing company Lyft,believes thatby 2025 ""private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S.   cities."" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be   self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar   strategies as well.Others have set similar timelines for the demise of car   ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at   Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusiness Insiderlast year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within   five to 10 years.Government regulations and our own apprehension about giving   up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car   ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal   clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on   an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like   many things, the transition from owning cars to renting   driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages   -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this   direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car   payments.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The technology, green cred and especially the potential long-term fuel savings go a long way toward overcoming any initial sticker shock.The big problem is range anxiety.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsRegular drivers don't worry about running out of gas because there is a vast network of gas stations across the country. With an estimated150,000 gas stations in the U.S.(in 2015), you are seldom more than a few minutes away from being able to refuel. Once there, it's typically five or 10 minutes to gas up, pay and be back on the road.Electric cars like those made by TSLA have the advantage of being able to be charged at home, but that takes a long time. According to Tesla's figures, half an hour on a home charger gets about 27 miles of driving range. And that doesn't help when you're traveling.The company has been building up a Supercharger network that takes on the role of gas stations. A Supercharger is capable of adding 270 miles of driving range in 30 minutes, and can fully charge a Tesla Model S with 90 kWh battery in roughly 75 minutes.Each Supercharger location isestimated to cost TSLA between $100k and $175kto build, taking 12-20 weeks to complete.TSLA Will Double Its North American Locations in 2017Tesla's Supercharger network has two challenges.First, it is much, much thinner than the nation's network of gas stations. In all of the U.S. Canada and Mexico,Tesla currently has just 373 Supercharger locations, with 2,636 connections. Many of those Supercharger locations are concentrated on the east and west coasts.Then there is the charging time. While filling your car with enough gas to go 500 miles might take five or 10 minutes, fully charging a base Model S takes 75 minutes.With Tesla ownership limited to early adopters with relatively deep pockets, the sparse Supercharger network has mostly been an annoyance - something Tesla owners learn to work around. With the Model 3 slated to go into production in September and kick off a wave of mass market Tesla ownership, those annoyances risk becoming a serious problem.Early adopters may be willing to work around challenges, but average consumers quickly turn against a product that requires them to jump through hoops.In its full-year 2016 update letter to investors,TSLA announced that is tackling the issue:""We plan to accelerate expansion of the Supercharger network this year, starting with doubling our number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017.""Expansion and New Charging PoliciesDoubling the number of North American Supercharger locations helps to address range anxiety by filling in some of those areas on the map that are currently blank. Since each location has multiple Superchargers, it also significantly expands the number of Tesla cars that can be charging at any given time.Tesla can't do much about the time needed to charge one of its cars - at least with current technology - but it has implemented several policies in the past few months to help deal with congestion at its Supercharger network.Weibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 EarningsIn December,TSLA announced an idle fee(billed by the minute) would be charged to Tesla owners who parked their vehicles at Superchargers and left them connected. Then in January it announced theend of unlimited free Supercharger accessfor new Tesla buyers going forward.Withclose to 400,000 of the $35k Model 3s pre-ordered- and a goal of producing 500k electric vehicles a year by 2018 - the pressure is on TSLA to ensure its Supercharger network can meet the coming flood of demand. The policy changes will help, but ultimately Tesla needs to expand its network of chargers to provide the coverage and availability drivers expect.Doubling the number of North American Supercharger locations this year will be costly, but is a necessary move for Tesla to go mass market.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Inc. Earnings: Sales Soar, and Model 3 Is Coming;2/22/2017;"Expectations were high ahead ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings report, with investors   particularly eager to get an update on the company's important   upcoming Model 3. In the three months leading up to the results,Tesla stocksoared about 51%.Tesla's fourth-quarter report seems to deliver on high   expectations, with the company reporting strong growth across its   business and management providing an optimistic update on Tesla's   important Model 3 program.Image source: author.makeArticleAd();Here's what investors should know about the report.The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016Q4 2015ChangeRevenue$2.3 billion$1.2 billion88%Automotive revenue$2.0 billion$1.1 billion79%EPS($0.78)($2.44)$1.66Non-GAAP EPS($0.69)($2.02)$1.33Vehicle production24,88214,03777%Data source: Tesla fourth-quartershareholder letter. Table by author.The resultsTesla's 88% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter revenue   was driven primarily by a 79% jump in the company's automotive   business, as vehicle production and deliveries climbed 77% and   27% year over year, respectively.Notably, Tesla's reported revenue benefited from the inclusion   of six weeks of SolarCity's operations, since the solar company   was acquired in November.While losses narrowed year over year, the company's Jan.   3-reported ""short-term production challenges"" associated with its   transition to new Autopilot hardware for its vehicles in Q4   weighed on deliveries and made it impossible for Tesla to sustain   the profitability it achieved in Q3. The company delivered 22,400   vehicles -- about 3,000 below its initial guidance and down from   24,821 deliveries in the third quarter of 2016.What management had to sayTesla was optimistic about Model 3, saying it was on plan for   the initial production of the $35,000 vehicle in July and volume   production in September. Further, Tesla said it expects Model 3   production to ""exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in   the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in   2018.""Model 3. Image source: Tesla.https://teslamotors.app.box.com/v/pressfiles/1/7248453397Also, Model S and Model X seem to remain in high demand ahead   of Model 3. Tesla said fourth-quarter Model S and X orders   reached a record high, increasing 49% year over year.Tesla said its integration of SolarCity's operations is going   well, stating that the company is ""on track to generate $500M in   cash (including growth of non-recourse project financing) by 2019   and achieve the cost synergies we committed to upon acquiring   SolarCity."" To meet that goal, Tesla is taking the ax to   SolarCity's high advertising expenses and will be selling solar   products at Tesla stores. In addition, Tesla will continue   shifting SolarCity's system sales away from leasing.Tesla provided more details on how it is already on track with   this target:As evidence that we are on plan, our solar operations added     $77 million of cash during the six weeks following the close of     the acquisition, with 28% of solar capacity deployed during Q4     sold rather than leased, up from 13% sold in Q3, and up from     less than 4% sold in Q4 2015.For guidance, the company opted to refrain from a full-year   outlook, focusing instead on the first half of the year.We expect to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X     vehicles combined in the first half of 2017, representing     vehicle delivery growth of 61% to 71% compared with the same     period last year. In addition, both GAAP and non-GAAP     automotive gross margin should recover in Q1 to Q3 2016 levels     and then continue to expand in Q2 2017.Further, Tesla says it expects to invest about $2 billion to   $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ""ahead of Model 3   production.""10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Mobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've long thoughtMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) is too expensive. Mobileye has an interesting opportunity in driver assistance, and eventually, autonomous driving. But it also has intense competition from companies ranging fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Tier 1 suppliers likeDelphi Automotive PLC(NYSE:DLPH) andAutoliv Inc.(NYSE:ALV). But I haven't shorted MBLY stock - yet - and I hardly thought Mobileye's fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday presented an opportunity.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv via FlickrAfter all, MBLY is a story stock, and the story looked strong heading into Mobileye earnings. A series of deals and partnerships announced in the past few weeks led MBLY stock up 35% from late December lows. Optimism around autonomous driving and increasing automotive technology continues to rise; there's a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-time highs. Betting against that in the short-term seemed foolish.That story appears to hold for a little while longer, as Mobileye earnings out Wednesday morning came in ahead of consensus estimates and the company's own guidance. In response, MBLY stock reversed from modest gains to modest losses back to 2%-plus gains again in premarket trading. That seems to imply that investors already are looking forward.But it's there the Mobileye story might have some holes.Mobileye Earnings Look SolidMobileye earnings for Q4 beat both Street consensus and its own guidance on the top and bottom line. Revenue of $104.6 million, in particular, looks impressive. MBLY had guided for roughly $96 million coming out of Q3 in moving expectations to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Heading into the earnings report, analysts largely backed those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe beat, then, implies growth roughly 11 points higher than thought, with revenue growing almost 46% year-over-year.The driver (no pun intended) appears to be aftermarket sales. Those sales - largely dash-mounted systems on existing cars, rather than installed systems in new cars - increased 156% year-over-year. MBLY management had raised full-year projections for that division after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobileye earnings show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sales increasing 113% for full-year 2016.Earnings per share beat consensus and implied guidance by 2 cents, which implies that profit margins were roughly as expected. The reason likely is that aftermarket sales offer lower gross margins, and thus aren't quite as profitable. MBLY has improved gross margins in the business, but mix seems like the most significant reason why the company didn't better leverage sales growth.Long-Term Questions Remain for MBLY StockThe fact that the revenue beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quite the outcome that Mobileye stock bulls would have preferred for Q4.The exciting business here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportunity and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sales is nothing to sneeze at, it's still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sales for 2016, on its own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterprise value over $10 billion.That seems to mean investors are looking forward. 2017 guidance on the conference call is for EPS of $1.01-$1.05 and revenue of $490 million-$505 million. Earnings appear just shy of analyst estimates of $1.04, while revenue of $490 million-$505 million suggests an outperformance to Street expectations of $491 million.That combination, however, means margins will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, likely comes from a higher-than-expected proportion of aftermarket revenue - again, not what the bulls necessarily wanted to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concerns to enter the narrative in MBLY stock in post-earnings trading.Looking ForwardMorgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye stock at the beginning of the month based on margin concerns - a move that took MBLY stock down 3%. And the ability of Mobileye to maintain margins is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptical that any semiconductor company can hold pricing (and thus margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobileye stock, now trading at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is priced higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia's huge gains over the past year have come from optimism over prospects for its Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turned to after its relationship ended with Mobileye (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decision alone illustrates the long-term challenges. Competition will be intense, and pricing will be too. It's important to remember that MBLY is a semiconductor company (though it has software capabilities, admittedly) and an automotive supplier. Neither industry traditionally gets very high earnings multiple, because both businesses are extremely tough.For Mobileye to be an outlier on both fronts, its execution needs to be perfect, and its growth flawless. Mobileye earnings for Q4 show a step in the right direction from that standpoint.But with the earnings beat driven largely by aftermarket sales, that step probably isn't big enough for MBLY stock to take another step higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postMobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

CIT stock is giving traders and active investors a well-defined risk-reward trade setup.Bulls should consider flashing their horns.While the broader stock market continues to relentlessly push higher, I am seeing and hearing more and more bears capitulate and join the buying spree. As a side note, remember that it typically is not until the majority of the bears capitulate and close their losing short positions that a market can begin to ""correct.""In a related manner, it broadly speaking is a low-probability bet to fight a strong market trend such as we have witnessed in the stock market since early November 2016. It's typically easier to trade in the direction of the broader market trend, either buying breakouts, or, after a stock gets overbought, waiting until a first level of support is reached and confirmed by a bullish reversal.Either way, fighting a strongly trending market such as many doubters have over the past few months is an easy way to get frustrated and lose money.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowYes, ultimately any rally comes to an end, but until such time where strong bearish reversals appear and key technical support areas are violated for more than a nanosecond, the higher-probability strategy is to stay with the trend.CIT Stock ChartsTaking this thought and applying it to the multiyear weekly chart of CIT Group, we see that the intermediate-term trend in the stock since early 2016 has been higher.Click to EnlargeWe also see that as a result of this 12-month rally, the stock has now once again reached (and possibly already marginally broken above) a key technical confluence area of resistance.The black diagonal resistance line that stretches from the early 2014 highs currently also lines up with the 200-week simple moving average (red).Note that the 200-week moving average used to act as support in but as of late 2015 has acted as resistance.As such, CIT stock is now at a critical area where if it can push and hold above could lead to a fresh leg higher over time.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock May Be In ""Ludicrous Mode""On the daily chart, we see that CIT stock in early February bounced off its blue and rising 100 day simple moving average, which has acted as an area of support prior.Click to EnlargeLast Friday, the stock staged what technical analysts refer to as an ""outside"" day or a ""bullish engulfing"" day that marginally broke shares past diagonal resistance.

Can Tesla, Inc. Grow Model S Sales in 2017?;2/22/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) growth in vehicle deliveries continued soaring   higher in 2016, essentially extending the company's streak of   about 50% compound average annualized growth or higher to four   years. But it took Tesla's late-2015 launched Model X SUV for the   company to maintain this impressive growth rate. Model S sales in   2016 were up only a meager 1% last year.With Model S growth quickly decelerating from 59% year over   year growth in 2015, to just 1% growth in 2016, could Model S   sales growth come to a halt -- or even worse -- begin declining   in 2017?Model S. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();Demand is still looking upDespite reporting just 1% growth in Model S sales in 2016,   Tesla seems optimistic about demand for the 2012-launched sedan.   In the company's most recent shareholder letter, Tesla pointed to   rapidly growing demand for the vehicle in the U.S. as evidence of   the vehicle's popularity with consumers.More than four years since its introduction, Model S     continues to expand market share, which is a testament to our     continuous vehicle innovation. In the U.S., which is Tesla's     most mature market, Model S deliveries grew nearly 60% year     over year, increasing its lead status with a 32% share of the     top 12 selling large luxury sedans, as Model S unit growth     significantly outpaced U.S. large luxury sedan category sales     growth.And in the company's brief press release on its fourth-quarter   deliveries, Tesla said fourth-quarter net orders for Model S and   X were at an all-time high.Further, Tesla has some good reasons to be optimistic about   Model S going forward. While Model S was launched in 2012, Tesla   has aggressively been rolling out major updates for the vehicle.   Indeed, some of the most significant updates to Model S have   found their way to the sedan very recently.In August, Tesla launched a flagship P100D Model S with a zero-to-sixty     time of 2.5 seconds when Ludicrous mode is enabled. And the     time dropped to 2.4 seconds earlier this year after a software     update.In October, Tesla began including sensors for autonomous driving in every     vehicle (the autonomous driving itself is slated to come later     on via a software update). Along with this new hardware, Tesla     began offering an enhanced version of its Autopilot.In January, Tesla launched its highest-range Model S yet, capable of     driving 335 miles on a single charge.Of course, Tesla'srelentless updatesto Model S don't guarantee the model's sales will continue to   increase, especially with the vehicle already outselling   comparably priced luxury sedans. But recent new features to Model   S, particularly standard self-driving hardware, are likely to   mitigate the possibility of sales declines in 2017.Could Model 3 orders cannibalize Model S     sales?But all of this overlooks one key concern about demand outlook   for Model S in 2017. Investors may be concerned Tesla's cheaper   Model 3, which is slated to launch later this year, could begin   cannibalizing Model S sales. After all, Model 3's starting price   is nearly half of Model S'.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Fortunately, there's already a precedent for how Model 3   announcements impact demand for Tesla's higher-cost models. Musk   explained how the Model 3's unveiling, which generated about   400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the vehicle in the months   following the product event, impacted Model S demand:An important point worth mentioning, we were fairly worried     about what would happen with the Model 3 announcement. Would it     cause like some a big drop in, say, Model S sales? It seems to     have had the opposite effect. It seems as though S demand has     increased.Therefore, it's possible that as hype grows ahead of the Model   3's launch, more overall interest for Tesla's entire vehicle   lineup could mount. Obviously, investors shouldn't count on this.   But at least Tesla's previous big Model 3 announcement's impact   on Model S demand bodes well for how any upcoming announcements   could affect Model S orders.Investors may be able to find out more about what Tesla   expects from its Model S this year when the company releases its   fourth-quarter earnings today, after market close.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes;2/22/2017;"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenets   of his investment strategy, a preference for companies with   serious ""competitive moats"" -- attributes that give them the   ability to sustainably keep ahead of their competition. But based   on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry   like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't   necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the   Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy   into these three mistakes.1. Focusing too much on sizeImage source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economies of scale are an important indicator for almost any   company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater   its ability to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that   it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to   the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter   of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered   during the same period.But scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't   necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker   with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead.   Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors   wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold   vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in   per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this   stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of   vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus   far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale   in the future.2. Exaggerating the value of network effectsWhat network?Network effects are often touted as one of the strongest   competitive moats around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the   network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or   platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to   make inroads.At first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent   opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all   ""talk"" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to   their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' --   right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take   into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly   in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars.   Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why   Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with   the best real-world object detection technology available.When Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1   billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because   the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road   -- it was because the company's robotics expertise ""gives Ford a   distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the   automotive and technology industries,"" explained Ford Chief   Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on   Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they   drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and   software designed to detect obstacles up to ""two football fields   away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others   aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're   interested in their cars having the most acute local-area   awareness they can contain.3. Expecting government regulation to limit competitionRegular regulationRegulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats   around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory   requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for   others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry   recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing   field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together   last April to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, "" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to ""work with   lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and   societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" These companies are   interested in standardizing national policy with simple and   low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for   Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest   regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest   names in the business are working proactively to push   policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory   moat.Picking the right self-driving car stockWarren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have   answers for every industry. There are many open questions around   self-driving cars, and some companies are morepoised to profitthan others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment   mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make informed investments, and set your   portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

First Week of April 21st Options Trading For Tesla;2/22/2017;"Investors in Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) saw new options become available this week, for the April 21st expiration. AtStock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the TSLA options chain for the new April 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $275.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $275.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $258.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of TSLA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $277.29/share today.Because the $275.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under thecontract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 37.79% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Inc, and highlighting in green where the $275.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of TSLA stock at the current price level of $277.29/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.55% if the stock gets called away at the April 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if TSLA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing TSLA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under thecontract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.57% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.09% annualized, which we refer to as theYieldBoost.The implied volatility in the put contract example is 41%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $277.29) to be 33%.

Tesla Earnings: 3 Questions for CEO Elon Musk Today;2/22/2017;"After the market closes today,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will update investors on its fourth-quarter   results and will probably provide forecasts for first-quarter and   full-year expectations. Further, the quarterly shareholder letter   may include an update on the company's important lower-cost Model   3, which is slated to launch in the second half of 2017.But some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla's update   tomorrow may not come from the quarterly shareholder letter, but   rather its earnings call following the letter's release. Known   for extra-long question-and-answer sessions, CEO Elon Musk often   fields questions from analysts for about an hour during the live   call. In previous calls, commentary has ranged from insights into   meaty details on the company's gross margin to updates on how   Tesla is anti-selling the Model 3 so demand doesn't get too far   ahead of the company's ability to ramp up supply.Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();So, what are some topics likely to surface during Tesla's   earnings call on Wednesday afternoon? Here are three questions,   along with some relevant background, that analysts are likely to   ask Musk.1. Will Tesla need to raise capital in 2017?In Tesla's third-quarter earnings call (via a Reuterstranscript), Musk said the company's ambitious Model 3 program currently   didn't require any capital raises. But Musk was also careful to   emphasize that this didn't mean the company wouldn't want to   raise capital:Now that's different from saying whether we should raise     capital or not to account for uncertainty to have a larger     buffer and to derisk the business. ... It seems like we     probably won't want to do a capital raise even in Q1. I'm not     saying we won't, but probably not. And it's overall looking     quite promising.Tesla's first quarter is more than halfway over, and the   company hasn't announced any capital raises yet. ButTesla stockis also trading significantly higher than it was during the   company's last earnings call. Tesla stock is up 50% in three   months, making an equity capital raise far more attractive than   it was toward the end of 2016.2. When will Tesla share more details on the Model     3?Tesla's Model 3 will obviously be the center of attention in   Tesla's fourth-quarter update. Investors will want to know if the   vehicle is on schedule and how many units management expects to   deliver in 2017.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.But investors may be particularly antsy to get another update   on how the vehicle's development is faring, given that Tesla'sfirst unveiling of its Model 3was a prototype more than a year before planned production. So   investors may want to know when the company is planning to share   more details on the vehicle. Musk said in November during the   company's shareholder meeting about its SolarCity acquisition   that the next announcements regarding the key vehicle could come   around April.3. When will solar begin positively affecting     results?With Tesla closing its acquisition of SolarCity in November,   investors will want to know whether the company could begin being   a positive cash contributor in 2017. As of Musk's last forecast   for SolarCity's impact on overall financials, he was   optimistic:I think I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral,     all things considered, next year. Yes. It does depend on how     fast we ramp up production in Buffalo.Tesla solar roof.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock May Be In “Ludicrous Mode”;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been in overdrive. Part of this has been due to the general bullishness across the markets, which seem to hit new highs every day. But the TSLA stock performance has been more than this. Since early December, the shares have gained a sizzling 47%. By comparison, during the same periodFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is up about 13%,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has gained about 22% andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is up 14%.makeArticleAd();Source: Tesla MotorsBut going forward, it's probably reasonable for investors to, well, get more cautious on TSLA stock, which reports earnings Wednesday. Consider that yesterdayUBS Group AG(USA)(NYSE:UBS) analyst Colin Langan published a grim report on the company.One of his big worries is the recent purchase of SolarCity, which has been a persistent money-loser. The company may also face more pressures as the Donald Trump Administration takes steps to pull back support for the clean-energy industry.According toLangan: ""We continue to believe SolarCity is an unneeded distraction during a very challenging launch period."" Actually, his price target on TSLA stock is at $160.Oh, and Wall Street has taken this to heart. On news of the report, Tesla stock fell nearly 4%. In other words, the shares appear to be particularly vulnerable to any negative news.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteYet Langan is certainly not the only Wall Street analyst who is bearish. Just look Cowen's Jeffrey Osborne. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his lowly price target on TSLA stock at $155. Again, he is skeptical about the SolarCity deal.Despite all this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has certainly found ways to gin things up. For example, he has indicated that the company is planning to enter India and theUnited Arab Emirates. No doubt, these markets have large populations of wealthy people that would love to buy Tesla cars. But then again, it will still take time to get traction. Let's face it, there will need to be investments in core infrastructure, like charging stations.Bottom Line On TSLA StockYet lack of demand has never really been the issue with Tesla. Rather, it has been the complexities of production. For example, in early January, TSLA disclosed that it had missed fourth-quarter and full-year estimates on deliveries.What's more, there may be some technical factors that could weigh on the company's shares. Given the high valuation - at over 7 times sales - it is reasonable that the firm will do an equity raise, which would dilute TSLA stock. The fact is that the company has substantial ongoing capital needs.And yes, the rally in the overall equities markets will certainly not last forever. Actually, the next few months could be a real test. That is, what will tax reform look like? And will the looser approach on regulations have much of an immediate impact? For the most part, Wall Street has been factoring in much of the potential good news - and then some.So with the markets getting frothy, it seems likely there will be a correction at some point. In fact, the Federal Reserve may soon become a factor. There may be more urgency to focus on ways to quell the enthusiasm in the markets.Yes, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is a Value TrapIf there is a drop in the markets, the impact could easily be disproportionate for TSLA. This has certainly been the case during the past few years. It's the kind of thing that happens with a fairly risky stock.And finally, Tesla will report its fourth quarter results next Wednesday. Given the surge in the stock already and the various risks like the SolarCity deal, it's probably best to wait on the sidelines for now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

GM Keeps Gaining on Driverless Cars and Possible European Merger;2/21/2017;"Shares of General Motors CompanyGM, the largest American automaker, are up again after the brief President's Day market break. On the back of reports that GM is looking to sell its European operations, along with other positive future-looking moves, the automaker could be poised to keep climbing.GM is up 1.96% to $37.95 per share after early Tuesday afternoon trading. GM is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (BUY) and its shares have been on the rise over the last year.It has been a week since reports surfaced that GM was discussing the sale of its European operations to French-based PSA Group, the maker of popular European car brands Peugeot and Citroën.The deal has already experiencedsome union push back. But German officials have voiced support for the GM and PSA deal asfear of plant closures have been curbed.GM's sale of British-based Vauxhall and German-based Opel to PSA could help its shares rise by 35%, according toa Sunday Barron's report. The deal would make PSA Europe's second-largest automaker by sales, but it could provide GM nearly $1 billion in cash.The European sell-off would also allow the U.S. auto manufacturing giant to pour more of its resources into GM's newest tech-based ventures and markets.InnovationGM has invested heavily in new technologies including ride-sharing and electric cars in the last few years. The automaker paid $500 million to purchase a minority stake in the second-largest U.S. ride-sharing company Lyft. It also purchased the autonomous car technology company Cruise Automation for $1 billion in March 2016.U.S. electric vehiclesales rose 37% in 2016. Despite all of the attention paid to TeslaTSLA, the ChevroletVolt has continued to do well, with December 2016 sales up 62% year-over-year.Heavy investment in self-driving vehicle tech has GM set to test autonomous Chevy Bolts in 2017. GM's focus on autonomous cars puts the company firmly in the race, along with Tesla, AlphabetGOOGLand Uber, to be the first to profit from driverless car tech.Uber has staked a lot of its future on self-driving cars. Now, with GM's help, Lyft has moved into the space as well.Maven, GM's year-old car-sharing service, is now in 17 U.S. cities. The service allows users to rent GM vehicles on-demand for short amounts of time. But unlike rival Zipcar, there is no membership fee. The service boasts that its 24,000 members have traveled nearly 78 million miles.Users can rent Chevy, Cadillac and Buick vehicles on their smart phonesfor an hourly rate of $6 to $8. Lyft drivers can rent a Chevy Equinox for $99 a week under Maven's Express Drive service.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Will Hit $300 After Q4 Earnings;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectric vehicle companyTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. With TSLA stock driving to all-time highs, investors are looking for confirmation that Tesla - as a company - is heading in the right direction.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor the record, analysts expect the Palo Alto, California-based company to lose 43 cents per share, narrower than the loss of 87 cents last year.Tesla, which has alternated between beating and missing estimates, posted a surprise profit for the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $2.19 billion compared to revenue of $1.75 billion a year ago.My GPS has alreadyforecast a higher pricefor TSLA stock following the result, but the Tesla earnings numbers - to be reported Wednesday after the bell - won't be the reason.The Real Driver for Tesla StockTSLA stock has gone on a strong run, surging more than 60% in 12 months, mostly in anticipation of positive results for the quarter.Beyond the top- and bottom-line numbers, however, Tesla stock will move based on the details the company provides about its new Model 3 - the company's all-electric mass-market vehicle that CEO Elon Musk hopes to start producing in July and selling next year. Competing withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) has been a major goal for Musk.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverWhat's more, Musk hasn't lowered expectations. The company still plans to ramp up vehicle production to a rate of 500,000 vehicles in 2018, which Tesla stock analysts consider highly ambitious.And much of the production goals depend on the success of the $35,000 Model 3, where investors' focus has shifted to over the last three months since the company reported disappointing vehicle deliveries.Tesla knocked out the shorts earlier this month as the company announced that its California plant would be prepped this month to start building Model 3s, and that full-scale production should begin by July. That lined up with Tesla's previously announced timeline - and a lack of delayssent TSLA shareholders into a frenzy.Bottom Line on TSLA StockBeyond the Model 3 and vehicle production targets, TSLA's need for cash will be another major factor on the conference call with analysts.Although Musk stopped short of promising to raise cash in the third-quarter conference call, Musk didn't shoot down the idea either, saying he would consider it if market conditions were right.Likewise, analysts will pay attention to estimates of how much cash the company expects to burn through in the quarters ahead.""Everything seems to be going according to plan regarding the car, but analysts will want to hear more details about ramp-up expenses,"" saidBill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for FreeNot to mention, there's the issue with absorbing the SolarCity business, which generated substantial losses before TSLA brought it into the fold. Worries about how much SolarCity would weigh down then-Tesla Motors caused shares to drop more than 20% between the Aug. 1 buyout agreement and the early December lows.Still, to the extent Tesla can lower production-cost estimates for the Model 3, while maintaining its production targets, TSLA stock should reach $300 in the next three months. That'd be another 8% on top of its already all-time high price.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks OffThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Will Hit $300 After Q4 Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is on a monster run of late. The long trade on AMD stock has been absurdly easy, especially when using options. I've even had success shorting the company recently, but only because I booked my profits quickly.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLast year conditioned me to not overstay my welcome in winning trades.After extended rallies, I am usually tempted to initiate short trades rather than long ones. Today, I will go against my instinct, though, and go long in AMD stock to capture a potential move (unthinkably) higher.Advanced Micro Devices' fundamentals haven't really changed in recent months. We're in a digital world and becoming even more reliant on tech. AMD is one of few who are the major suppliers to the brains of this tech world. This tells me that there is room for all - like rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) to prosper. So I don't want to short anything just for the sake of shorting.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowClick to EnlargeFurthermore, I see things I like in AMD's stock chart. The price action has been constructive. I see higher lows challenging necklines that if broken upwards can invite even more buyers.I'm not usually one to chase a stock long on a 6%-plus day like what AMD stock is putting out on Tuesday. But the options market makes this fairly easy while leaving room for error.How to Trade AMD Stock NowThe bet:Sell AMD Oct $9 put for 60 cents per contract. By selling this put, I am committing to owning AMD shares at the strike sold. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price. I can even buy sacrifice Apr $9 puts for 4 cents to cover the crash scenario should it come.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade, but in this case, I will refrain. In fact, I'll add an extra twist that could provide even more profit potential.Go Long the Super Spike in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Juice (optional): Buy the AMD Mar $14.5/$15.5 debit call spread for 28 cents to open. If I am correct and AMD stock rallies past my spread, I could gain up to 70 cents per contract. A more aggressive version of this would be to buy naked calls instead.I am not obliged to hold any of these trades through their expiration.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is the Perfect VALUE Play;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI love growth stocks as much as the next guy, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorite at the moment. That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockAny value left whatsoever.I'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.Go With GARPWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.GOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut there's even more good news.This doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.On $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.That's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.How Is Alphabet's Business?The next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engineholds an astonishing 80.47% market share. As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.Alphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.As for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.This brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGLin something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Tesla, Inc. Earnings: What to Expect From Gross Margin;2/21/2017;"WhileTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) plans for its upcoming Model 3 will likely be   the main focus when the electric-car maker reports itsfourth-quarter resultson Wednesday, another area worth checking on will be Tesla's   gross profit margin, or its revenue less cost of goods sold as a   proportion of total revenue. As Tesla continues to grow its   business at a rapid rate, it's important for Tesla to sustain a   sufficient gross profit margin to help support its ambitious   growth plans, particularly as the company readies its lower-cost,   higher-volume Model 3 for a launch later this year.Ahead of Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings release, here's what   we know about Tesla's gross margin metrics for various aspects of   its business.Model X in Tesla's car factory. Image source: authormakeArticleAd();What has happened with Tesla's gross profit margins?In recent quarters, Tesla's gross profit margin has been   moving steadily upward. But it hasn't yet returned to pre-Model X   levels.TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYChartsTesla's late-2015 launch of its Model X has weighed on the   company's profitability thanks to a slower-than-expected   production ramp-up and what management has admitted to be ""hubris   in adding far too much technology to the Model X in version   1....""But Tesla's recent significant progress in its profit margins   offers promising signs for the company's ability to benefit from   operational leverage as Model X deliveries increase, rising from   2,400 in its first quarter of 2016 to 9,500 in the fourth   quarter.In Tesla's third quarter, total automotive gross margin and   gross profit per car increased substantially. Non-GAAP automotive   gross margin when excluding benefits from zero emission vehicle   credits and the impact of stock-based compensation, was 25%, up   140 basis points sequentially. GAAP automotive gross margin was   29.4%, up from 23.1% in Q2. Tesla said the improvements were   driven by improving manufacturing efficiency and higher   production volume.Overall gross margin was 27.7% in Tesla's third quarter,   compared to 21.6% in Q2. It was helped by higher zero emission   vehicle credits, the company's improving gross margin in its   automotive business, and its sequential improvement in its   services and other segment (from 2.5% in Q2 to 3.4% in Q3).What to look for in Q4For Tesla's fourth quarter, management has said it expects its   automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits, to be between   about 25.1% and 26.1%, or between 23.9% and 24.9% on a non-GAAP   basis. Notably, however, since Tesla has already said its   fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries were about 3,000 units below   its expectations, it's likely Tesla's reported automotive gross   profit margin will be near the low end of this guidance range --   or possibly even slightly below it.Image source: Author.For Tesla's services and other segment, investors should look   for a sequential improvement from its 3.4% margin achieved in Q3.   Since energy storage products are accounted for in this segment,   an expected rise in energy storage deliveries should benefit the   segment's gross margin.Of course, guidance for its gross margin in Q1 and throughout   2017 will likely be just as helpful for investors in gaining more   insight into the company's profitability trajectory ahead of   Model 3. So, investors should look for an update on what Tesla   expects from its gross profit margin in its first quarter and   beyond.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Battery Stocks to Buy in 2017;2/21/2017;"Overheating batteries spelled disaster forSamsunglast year, but batterystocks?They're red hot in a good way-- and ripe for the picking as we enter into 2017.From miners of lithium to manufacturers of lithium ion,   nickel-metal hydride, and other sorts of batteries, investors   today have a good handful of public battery companies to choose   from. For my money, though, the best ""battery stocks"" to watch   are the ones targeting the market for electric cars:Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Panasonic(NASDAQOTH: PCRFY) , andGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) .(And no, that's not a typo. As I'll explain, General Motors   reallyisa force to be reckoned with in electric car batteries.)makeArticleAd();Batteries are evolving -- and more important than ever.     Image source: Getty Images.TeslaWhy cars? Partly because of scale. Tesla's 60 kWh battery   pack, for example, is powered by 14 battery modules, containing   384 battery cells each. That's a total of at least 5,376 cells   that go into each Tesla Model S sold. Larger battery packs will   logically contain even more modules and cells. Multiply that by   the 500,000 electric cars Tesla plans to be selling annually by   2020, that's ... a lot of batteries. And that's before   counting the numbers of batteries (admittedly, of different   types) that go into powering electric cars from General Motors,   fromFord, fromToyota,Nissan, and all the others.In addition, you've probably heard by now thatTesla has changed its name, dropping the ""Motors"" moniker from ""Tesla Motors."" Part of the   reason for this change is that Tesla is making energy storage for   homes and business a bigger part ofitsbusiness, with its new Powerwall product. In doing so, Tesla   isn't just opening a new market for batteries, and creating a   place for solar power, generated by its solar-panels business, to   be stored when not needed -- it's also giving itself room to   scale up its business, so that it will be able to make full use   of the battery Gigafactory it's building in the Nevada   desert.PanasonicIncidentally, this offers us a nice segue into discussing   Tesla's partner in the Gigafactory project -- our second battery   stock to watch, which is Panasonic.The Japanese electronics giant is assisting Tesla with battery   production in Nevada, and hopes to benefit from both the scale of   battery production there, and from the assured customer for its   batteries that Tesla will become (and indeed, already is).   Already the world's top battery manufacturer by a factor of   3, Panasonic's battery dominance promises to grow even   further through its partnership with Tesla.I'd also be remiss in not pointing out that, whereas Tesla may   be the biggest story stock in battery investing, it's not   currently profitable -- but its supplier Panasonic is. According   to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, Panasonic earned $1.9 billion in profit over the past year. And   Panasonic's ""automotive and industrial systems"" division, which   houses its battery business, contributed more profit ($914   million) than any of the company's other three big divisions.   With a stock now trading for less than 14 times trailing   earnings, Panasonic is arguably one of the best bargains in   battery stocks today.General MotorsBut it's still not as cheap as General Motors. I know, I know   -- you say General Motors makes cars, not batteries. But take a   look at whatkindof cars General Motors has been making lately: The Chevy Volt,   namedMotor Trend's Car of the Year in 2011.  The Chevy Bolt, named Car of   the Yearthisyear. In both instances, General Motors won accolades for   rolling out electric cars.While General Motors doesn't make the batterycellsthat go into powering these cars (South Korea's LG Chem does that   for the company), GM does assemble those cells into the batterypacks. What's more, GM's involvement in battery technology may be   deeper than you know.InThe Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the   World, formerWall Street Journalcorrespondent Steve Levine describes the history of America's   Argonne National Laboratory and its efforts to build a better   rechargeable battery -- specifically, one capable of powering a   car for 200 miles of driving on a single charge. Central to the   book's story is General Motors' work with battery behemoths such   as LG Chem, and also with ground-breaking start-ups such as   privately held Envia -- including through making equity   investments in the latter.Simply put, GM is working -- both through its in-house battery   lab and through partnerships elsewhere in the battery industry --   to develop an entirely new ""superbattery"" that it calls NMC 2.0.   Unlike the banks of generic, cheap, but older-tech   nickel-cobalt-aluminum 18650s that power Tesla's sedans, GM has   been developing a nickel-manganese-cobalt cell that it believes   will offer greater energy density, giving Chevy's Bolts (and   future electric cars) a range advantage over Tesla.At last report, General Motors still hadn't solved the mystery   of inventing NMC 2.0. But investing in GM stock for just 6.2   times earnings, you wouldn't be paying much for the potential   that it eventually will.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

So logic here would be to want to sell calls or call spreads against this mega spike. Not this time. Earnings are coming and these are binary events.

I don't know how traders will react to earnings regardless of the quality of the numbers themselves.So today, I want to invest some of my profits in going long TSLA stock for a breakout to new highs. I want to ride the so-called ""animal spirit"" that is the meme of 2017.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverClick to EnlargeTechnically, TSLA stock already hit my target from the $258 per share breakout as noted on the chart. From here, we would need a game changing event and earnings could serve that purpose. Wall Street has a crush on Elon Musk and his conference call could be a treasure trove of catalysts.The Bet:Buy the TSLA March $330 call. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.60 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. If TSLA spikes to new highs this level should be within target.I could modify this trade for a more moderate bet by turning it into a spread. So I'd buy TSLA March 31 $315/$320 debit call spread for 60 cents per contract. If TSLA rallies past my spread I stand to gain more than $4 per contract. The spread makes the trade more reasonable as it is closer to current price. So I don't require as big a move as buying calls at $330.Often I like to lower my out of pocket expense and in this case I could sell some puts against TSLA stock levels I deem safe.The Bank (optional):Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $200 put. For this I collect $14 per share. I need TSLA stock to stay above my strike sold or risk being put the stock. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own Tesla stock at $200 per share. Anything below $186 per share would constitute losses on this leg alone.I am not required to hold my Tesla options trade open through their expiration. I can close any of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

How a Major Utility Fell on Its Face in Renewable Energy;2/21/2017;"It was supposed to be an easy transition forNRG Energy(NYSE: NRG) from utility giant to renewable energy powerhouse.   The company had billions in cash flow coming in from fossil fuel   plants that could then be turned around and invested in wind,   solar, electric charging stations, and energy storage. Simple   enough, right?The problem for NRG Energy and former CEO David Crane is that   utility investors and renewable energy investors are like oil and   water. They simply don't mix and neither one quite understands   the other. So, less than two years after launching a brand-new   Home Solar business and putting a huge focus on clean energy, the   company is shutting down parts of its solar business and looking   into strategic alternatives afterElliott ManagementandBluescape Energy Partnerswere given seats on the board of directors. Don't be fooled: NRG   Energy is heading for a breakup because dirty and clean energy   just can't live together.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The death of NRG HomeAt one time, NRG Home was supposed to give SolarCity a ""run   for their money."" Seriously, NRG thought it could build a solar   installation arm that rivaled the biggest players in the country.   It acquired Roof Diagnostics to gain a decent market share and   added solar products company Goal Zero as another way to attract   customers.The theory was good on the surface. A big utility name puts   its financial muscle behind residential solar, which will give   the product validation and the company's operations stability.   Only that's not what the industry needed.Instead of customers flocking to a utility trying to distrupt   itself, they stuck with companies trying to disrupt the world.   SolarCity,Vivint Solar,Sunrun, andSunPowerremained more attractive options for customers than NRG Home. And   in the past 18 months, the market has been shifting away from   large national installers to local and regional installers that   have lower costs and can be more nimble in the market.We've seen something similar with NRG's EV charging network.   It's a good solution from the wrong player in the market. So,   instead of NRG's flexible charging network being a marvel of the   EV community,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the charging network that's become the standard   everyone else has to live up to.The clash of the old world and the newIt isn't that NRG's management got their vision of the future   wrong. It's that NRG wasn't necessarily the company to execute on   that vision. Its customers were confused by the transition to   solar, and in many states NRG Home was trying to enter, they had   no prior knowledge of NRG. And investors in a utility like NRG   were looking for cash flow, not billions of dollars of investment   in a business that may take years to show real signs of   progress.With the activist investors involved, NRG Energy is likely to   split into a green business and a fossil fuel business. The green   business has already been separated and is either shutting down   or being sold. NRG Home is being wound down and a majority stake   in EVgo has been sold. It's possible theNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) stake will be sold as well in an effort to monetize   assets and return the cash to shareholders.Whether there's a spinoff or just a sale of assets, it looks   like the old energy world is beating the new at NRG Energy.A transition gone wrongIt's harder than it seems for fossil fuel companies orutilities to make a transitionto new, cleaner forms of energy. The investment structure and   incentives for the two are just too different to coexist. Fossil   fuels and utilities are all about cash flows and finding ways to   make money off the status quo.Renewable energy, particularly energy production on rooftops,   is about breaking the energy status quo and replacing it with   more individual independence. And breaking the traditional energy   business doesn't always come with predictable cash flows or   installations each quarter.The two strategies are simply at odds with each other, and NRG   Energy abandoning most of its renewable business is a casualty of   the realities of the energy industry today. Old and new forms of   energy just don't mix under one roof and NRG Energy found that   out the hard way.10 stocks we like better than NRG EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Tesla, Volatility Index and Gilead;2/21/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 21, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Volatility Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Free Report)andGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Free Report).5 Major Myths About Options TradingWhen it comes to investing, pretty much everyone has an opinion. While those opinions are great, sometimes investors will spread myths about subjects they don't have a firm understanding of. One of the most confusing subjects isoptions trading. Due to the many moving parts involved, investors find themselves befuddled and not knowing where to start. Here I'm going to debunk five major myths of options trading.Myth #1: Options are Riskier than StocksThis is one of those broad-based, blanket statements that does not tell the whole truth. People think options are riskier because you can lose 100% of your investment in an option. However, you can use options to limit your risk on trades.Here's an example, let's say you wanted to buy 100 shares ofTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)ahead of their earnings report next week because you think they are going to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goes down 10% on its earnings report, you are going to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goes up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goes down 10% and stays there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goes up 10%, you're call option will be worth at least $2,700, maybe more. If you wanted to define your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, controlling 200 shares of Tesla rather than only 100. Same amount of nominal risk, but now your upside potential is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophisticated Trader for   OptionsThere certainly are options strategies that involve a great deal of complexity. With so many choices available to trade it can be very complicated. Each options expiration date has call options and put options of varying strikes available. At first glance the selection process can be daunting. Many stocks now have weekly options expiration, making these even more overwhelming for investors.You don't need a PhD in Applied Mathematics to use simple options strategies to make money and create income. For example, buying a call in the hopes that a stock goes up. If you know there is an event coming up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goes up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefits when the stock goes down, you can buy a put option in the hopes the stock goes down. Start with the basics and add more complex strategies as you become more comfortable.Myth #3: It Takes a Lot of Money to Trade   OptionsThis couldn't be further from the truth. It's a lot less capital intensive to trade options than it is to buy 100 shares of your favorite stock. Most brokerage firms allow you to sell options premium, a more advanced strategy, in accounts that contain as little as $2,000. Compare that to Pattern Day Trader accounts which require at least $25,000.Trading options allows smaller accounts to gain exposure to more stocks for less money. You can diversify your options trades across many industries and many stocks simultaneously. There are even options on ETFs like theVolatility Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Free Report)so you can gain exposure to exotic financial instruments while managing your risk.Myth #4: Time is Always Working Against YouIf you are long or buy options then yes, there is a time value element that's working against you. However, there are simple ways to flip the script so this time works in your favor. One way is by using long call and long put spreads rather than buying a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-legged options trade where a closer to the money option is purchased to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. This helps to drop the overall net debit or price of the call spread. It also limits the total profit potential of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Free Report)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upside potential would be unlimited but my breakeven would be the strike price plus the net debit which in this case is $2.95, making my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believe Gilead's upside is limited to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expiration and take back some money, dropping my overall cost on the spread, therefore bringing down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is only $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Another example is the credit spread. Rather than buying the aforementioned spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spending $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 difference in the strike prices, minus the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. This credit spread would max out or give me the largest possible winning outcome of $2.40 if shares of GILD closed at or below $62.50 at expiration on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade   OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an options risk acknowledgement form and get your account approved specifically for options trading, it's not exactly a ""special account."" Pretty much any non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is eligible for options trading. I specify non-qualified because accounts like IRAs are restricted as to the type of options trading you can do since you can't short stocks in retirement accounts.There are several levels of options approvals out there, designed to save investors from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, only allowing certain types of trading. Each broker has their own guidelines for what these levels look like. All you really need for approval is experience trading and capital. It's not like you have to be a millionaire or anything.Bottom LineThose are the five biggest myths about options trading that scare off potential traders. If you take the time to learn more about trading options, you'll find that they are a great way to manage your risk and gain exposure to the stock market.FollowBrian Bolanon Twitter@BBolan1Want more articles from this author?

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointing to an extension of Wall Street's record run, as traders come back refreshed from the President's Day break.Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) is up on strong earnings results, whileWal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) earnings are waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, the Markit February preliminary purchasing managers' manufacturing and services indexes are on tap later this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.29%, withS&P 500futures adding 0.18% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.17%.On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday with about 18.6 million calls and 16.1 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.59, while the 10-day moving average dropped to a two-month low of 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) hit fresh all-time-high territory on Friday, following a new data on Apple Pay's acceptance at U.S. retailers. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is seeing renewed call activity ahead of this Wednesday's quarterly earnings report andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) tagged a new all-time high on Friday, joining the rest of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks in record territory.Apple Inc. (AAPL)Forget about iPhones and iPads, the new driver for AAPL stock is services. On Friday, a report emerged that one of those services,Apple Pay, is now accepted by 36% of U.S. retailers, with another 22% expected to start accepting the service in the next 12 months. The narrative on Apple Pay has only grown more bullish since CEO Tim Cook's statement that Apple Pay transactions were up 500% year-over-year in the most recent fiscal quarter.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeAAPL options traders jumped on the report, sending more than 920,000 contracts across the tape on the shares. Furthermore, calls accounted for an above average 67% of the day's take. AAPL may be trading near all-time highs, but that hasn't stopped options traders from setting their sights even higher, with more than 36,000 call contracts open at the March $140 strike and another 8,500 at the $145 strike.With AAPL breaking through peak March call OI at $135 on Friday, look for options traders to adjust their targets even higher, resulting in another round of heavy call activity this week.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Electric car guru Tesla is slated to take the earnings stage this Wednesday amid mixed sentiment. Wall Street is expecting a loss of 30 cents per share on revenue of $2.2 billion, though thewhisper numberis pricing in a wider loss of 41 cents per share.Per-share results may be moot, however, as traders will be looking for information on deliveries and Model 3 production, which is slated to begin this week.Tesla has more than 370,000 Model 3 preordersfor the Model 3 and CEO Elon Musk has promised production of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, but Tesla only delivered 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016.Options traders are naturally skeptical of TSLA stock, especially with the shares pulling back from their recent all-time highs. On Friday, TSLA options activity underscored that trepidation, with calls only eking out 51% of the more than 473,000 contracts traded. Currently, peak 24 Feb call OI totals 4,800 contracts at the $305 strike, while peak 24 Feb put OI numbers 1,900 at $260. Implieds are pricing in a roughly 7% move for TSLA stock following earnings.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)AMZN stock was the last of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks to reach all-time-high territory on Friday, though the shares are still stymied by overhead resistance at $850. However,Amazon may be ready for a breakout, and options traders appear to be preparing for additional upside.Friday's call activity came in slightly above average for AMZN, with these typically bullish bets accounting for 53% of the 302,000 contracts traded. Furthermore, the March put/call open interest ratio has steadily declined for the past couple of weeks.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itching to Break All-Time HighsWhile the ratio currently rests at a bearish leaning 1.22, it has dropped from a perch north of 1.30 as calls are added at a faster rate than puts - a trend that could signify options traders' expectations of additional gains for AMZN stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends5 Top Dividend Stocks to Shower Solid ReturnsThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Tesla (TSLA) to Post Q4 Earnings: Will the Stock Disappoint?;2/20/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAis set to report fourth-quarter 2016 resultsafter the market closeson Feb 22. In the last quarter, this electric car maker posted a positive earnings surprise of 112.28%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Tesla Motors, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTesla Motors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Tesla Motors, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing this QuarterTesla delivered 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter, missing the 25,000 unit target. The total deliveries in 2016 were 76,230 vehicles, falling short of the projection of 79,000 units. This could affect revenues in the quarter. Tesla claimed the company was unable to meet targets due to short-term production challenges.Tesla's costs for research & development and selling, general and administrative expenses is also a concern. The company is investing heavily in increasing production capacity, the development of Model X and Model 3, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure. For 2016, the company expects operating expenses to rise by 30% due to engineering, design, and testing expenses related to Model 3 supplier contracts as well as higher sales and service costs associated with expanding geographically. Moreover, due to accelerated production plans, Tesla now expects capital expenditure for 2016 to be around $1.18 billion.The company has been outperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for the past six months, with the company gaining 22.1% while the industry rallied only 14.3% over the same period. However, this gain can be particularly attributable to Tesla's recent expansion decisions, including the venture into the Middle East.The company reported losses for full year 2015 and 2014 as well as in first-half 2016. Further, the company reported profits in third-quarter 2016 but it remains to be seen whether this can be sustained in the quarter to be reported. Moreover, the company also faces the risk of potential buyers being deterred due to the low number of charging stations. Although the company is working toward developing a supercharging network, the number of charging stations still remains drastically low, particularly when compared with gasoline stations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Tesla is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP:Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -55.46%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.85 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Spartan Motors, Inc.SPARhas an Earnings ESP of +50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;2/19/2017;"Stocks extended their rally last week as both theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) andS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  gained over a full percentage point. The   two indexes are up nearly 5% so far for the year.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Earnings season is likely to continue to produce big stock   swings for the companies involved. And the next five trading days   have no shortage of big names posting their results, includingWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,andGap(NYSE: GPS) .Wal-Mart's customer trafficThe world's biggest retailer announces earnings results before   the market opens on Tuesday. Expectations are low, with consensus   estimates pegging sales growth of just 1% as earnings fall 13%,   to $1.29 per share.Customer traffic figures will be key to watch this week.   Wal-Mart has managed seven straight quarters of improvements   there, but last quarter, the figure slipped to nearly flat. Since   then, rivalTargetrevealed a surprising 1.7% traffic decline over the holiday   season, which suggests growth was hard to come by as competition   heated up last quarter.Image source: Wal-Mart.Any growth slowdown might be complicated by rising costs,   especially in the U.S. business. On the positive side, Wal-Mart   is likely to keep showering shareholders with dividends and stock   buyback spending that's being funded by surging free cash   flow.Tesla's deliveries forecastTesla shares are up over 50% in the last three months heading   into Wednesday's earnings release despite the fact that investors   know the electric-car manufacturerwon't hit management's delivery forecast. CEO Elon Musk and his team signed over roughly 22,000 vehicles   to customers, representing 27% growth year over year compared to   the 25,000 that executives were targeting. Management blamed what   they called short-term production challenges around the   transition to new autopilot hardware that delayed shipping.Image source: Tesla.Investors will be looking for evidence this week that those   production challenges are in the past. At the same time, there's   less hope Tesla will announce bottom-line profitability this   quarter, but gross margin and gross profit per car should   continue marching higher.Looking forward, shareholders are eager to learn Musk's   thinking on the company's sales targets for the coming year as   the mass-market Model 3 comes online. Telsa is hoping to use that   car to help bring its annual production up to 500,000 units from   about 100,000 automobiles today, and its 2017 forecast will   communicate a lot about whether that aggressive goal is   realistic.Gap's profit marginGap recently revealed encouraging operating details about the   fourth-quarter report it will publish on Thursday.   Comparable-store sales rose 1% to reverse an 8% dive in the   prior-year period. That improvement includes a 5% uptick for the   Old Navy brand, flat results for Gap, and a 3% drop for Banana   Republic. ""Against a challenging retailer backdrop,"" CEO Art Peck   said in early February, ""we're pleased to report growth in our   top-line and comp sales during the critical holiday quarter.""This week's announcement will provide important context on   those revenue gains, including whether Gap was forced to ramp up   its promotions to protect market share from rivals. That's why   investors will be focused on the retailer's merchandise margins   and any comments management might have on customer traffic   trends.Peck and his team will likely discuss Gap's plan to return to   growth across the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy franchises   through improved product offerings like the recent Athleta   launch. That job will be made harder by a weak retailing   environment, though, and so investors might want to brace for a   conservative 2017 forecast from management this week.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Are General Motors and Lyft About to Crush All Self-Driving Rivals?;2/19/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) is planning to build and deploy thousands of   self-driving electric cars in test fleets with Lyft next year,   according to a newReutersreport.If that's for real, it will be by far the largest fleet of   autonomous test vehicles in operation. It's a very big deal that   has huge implications for GM, Lyft, and their   rivals.What the report saidAccording to the Reuters article, GM will build thousands of   Chevy Bolts equipped with prototype versions of the self-driving   system GM has developed with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation.   Most of these self-driving Bolts will go into ride-hailing   service with Lyft in several states starting sometime in   2018.makeArticleAd();GM has no plans right now to sell the self-driving Bolts to   the general public.CEO Mary Barra announced in December that GM would begin     producing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt test vehicles in early     2017. Image source: General Motors.What it would mean for GMGM has been working on self-driving technology for years. That   work seemed to take a big leap forward with the acquisition of   San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation early last year.   It appears that Cruise has since become the center of GM's   research efforts. Cruise's self-driving Chevy Bolt test cars have   become regular sights on San Francisco streets, and recent videos   taken from inside self-driving Bolt test cars suggest thatthe GM/Cruise technology is at a fairly advanced   level. GM announced in December that it would soon begin   producing self-driving Bolt test vehicles, but the hint was that   -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produced in   small quantities for GM's own testing.A mass deployment would demonstrate two things: First, that   GM's technology really is at a high level, and second, that GM   and its supplier partners are ready and able to mass-produce   self-driving cars.Both of those things are significant. Taken together, it would   be a strong argument that GM is leading the way to mass-produced   Level 4 self-driving vehicles. Companies likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of investor attention for   (among other things) their self-driving efforts, but --   as of right now, at least -- GM seems poised to leapfrog just   about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like its larger rival Uber Technologies, knows that   replacing its human drivers with self-driving vehicles is crucial   to its future. Autonomous ride-hailing vehicles will allow Lyft   to lower its prices while generating (hopefully) strong   profits.Uber has been working on its own self-driving technology for a   couple of years, and has a fewprototype self-driving test cars in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done any work on a self-driving   system of its own, but it doesn't need to: GMowns a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seems to have it handled.If Lyft beats Uber to a self-driving fleet at scale, Uber will   have a big challenge on its hands.GM president Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-founders Logan     Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM owns 9% of the ride-hailing     company, and Ammann is a member of its board of directors.     Image source: General Motors.Could this be for real?The Reuters report, by veteran auto-business journalist Paul   Lienert, cites two unnamed ""sources familiar with the automaker's   plans."" Generally, investors (and everyone else) should take   reports based on information from unnamed sources with a grain or   two of salt. But a few things suggest to me that this is probably   for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuters   holds its reporting to high standards. Second, the report fits   with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonomous GM vehicles in Lyft service is   forthcoming. Third, GM's Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built,   has plenty of capacity to do a special production run in the   thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM denied the   report. In fact, GM's statement in response was almost a smiling   hint:We do not provide specific details on potential future     products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV     technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network     applicationsooner than you might think. [Emphasis added.]Translation: This is likely to happen, and it might begin   sooner than 2018.How important is this for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a   ""race"" to self-driving technologyisn't really useful to investors, a big test like this next year (or sooner) will show that GM   isn't about to be disrupted by Silicon Valley when it comes to   self-driving. It will also give lots of people an   opportunity to experience self-driving technology firsthand,   which will almost certainly speed its adoption by increasing   consumer demand.If nothing else, it seems very likely to attract investors'   attention and give GM shares a boost.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Solar Energy Production Hit a Record High in 2016, So What's Wrong With Solar Stocks?;2/18/2017;"2016 was an amazing year for the solar industry overall, even   if it wasn't great for solar stocks. GTM Research recently   reported that its upcoming U.S. Solar Market Insight Report done   with the Solar Energy Industries Association will reveal a 95%   jump in installations last year to 14.6 GW.To put that number into perspective, that's enough solar to   power 2.4 million homes in the U.S. On top of the huge   installation numbers, solar accounted for 39% of all new   electricity installed in 2016, a record for the industry. And   with costs coming down every year, the future looks bright for   the industry.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The solar industry's great yearThe chart below shows the solar industry's incredible growth   over the past six years. Every segment of the market has grown,   led by the utility-scale solar market.Data source: GTM Research / SEIAU.S. Solar Market Insight Report.This surge versus 2015 was driven by falling costs for solar   installations and contracts signed to be completed in 2016 before   the solar investment tax credit (ITC) was extended. It really   was the ITC that led to a massive boom in solar last year,   but it's also the reason solar stocks had a terrible 2016.What went wrong with solar stocksAcross the board, solar stocks had a rough year in 2016,   despite the installation boom.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) are all down significantly since the start of 2016.   And SolarCity would be in the same boat if it weren't for its   buyout byTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .SPWRdata byYCharts.The reason stocks are down is because the ITC extension meant   there were very few new contracts signed in 2016. The activity   that led to last year's boom in installations was a result of   contracts signed in 2014 and 2015, before the ITC extension was   signed. So, what investors were concerned about was the lack of   new contracts in the market.Even the residential market went through something of a   slowdown. Final numbers aren't out yet, but growth is likely in   the single or low double digits, driven by the lack of urgency to   install solar. Residential projects have a much shorter lead time   than utility projects, so the ITC extension hit the market as   early as the first quarter of 2016, whereas the impact of the ITC   won't be a drag on utility installations until 2017.What solar investors can expect in the futureWe've known for a few quarters now that 2017 will be bad for   the solar industry. Utility-scale projects will be hard to come   by domestically and even projects signed this year won't likely   begin construction until 2018 or beyond. And the 14.6 GW of solar   installed in 2016 will likely be the industry's peak until at   least 2018.But the good news is that solar energy is cheaper than   ever and it's now competing with fossil fuels on a cost   basis. Long term, that will lead to a tremendous amount of   growth, and companies like First Solar, SunPower, Vivint, Sunrun,   and Tesla should lead the way. It's going to be a bumpy ride,   though, to get to that growth on the horizon.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Wind and Solar May Have to Fill In for America's Crumbling Hydro Infrastructure;2/18/2017;"When politicians talk about ""crumbling infrastructure,"" it's   often hard to ascertain exactly what they're talking about. Is itbridges falling down, an excessive number of potholes, or maybe aging airports? It   could mean any number of things depending on who's talking and   who's listening.This week, an aging piece of infrastructure is acutely   impacting nearly 200,000 people in California as the Oroville   Dam's damaged spillways teeters close to collapse, potentially   flooding a large swath of northern California. The dam itself   doesn't (yet) appear to be damaged, but it's not functioning as   planned. And the problems aren't new given the fact that   environmental groups were pushing for additional spillway   construction 12 years ago at the now 49-year-old dam.   Incidentally, dams are only designed with a 50-year life span, so   it's worth keeping in mind that infrastructure isn't built to   last forever.Any kind of infrastructure goes through normal wear and tear   over time, but the challenge today is the sheer age of dam   infrastructure in the U.S. According to a 2015 Department of   Energy report, 75% of hydro capacity is at plants that are over   50 years old (although some have been upgraded since first   construction). The Oroville Dam's potential spillway collapse   could bring that age into focus, which could impact other sources   of renewable energy as well.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Crumbling dam infrastructureThe chart below is from the Department of Energy's 2014   Hydropower Market Report, which was released in April 2015. It   shows that a vast majority of U.S. hydro plants were built   between 1940 and 1970, particularly large plants.Image source: Department of Energy 2014 Hydropower Market     Report.If these plants begin to be reviewed more closely or are   decommissioned, it could take dozens of gigawatts of energy   production offline over the next decade. And given their age, it   may be a good idea to do just that.The crumbling hydro infrastructure may also be a new   opportunity for wind and solar energy in the U.S.. When you   consider that hydro power generated 249 million MWh of   electricity in 2015, the opportunity is enormous.Energy and the RPS standard conundrumHydro power is the biggest source of renewable energy in the   U.S., only recently surpassed by all other renewable energy   sources (excluding nuclear) combined. So, it's a big piece of the   energy industry.Image source: U.S. EIA.But it's also the biggest single part of state-level renewable   portfolio standards (RPS). In states like California, this is the   policy that has driven the growth in wind and solar over the past   decade. If you pull any hydro plant out of the mix, another   energy source has to fill that gap. And it will have to be clean   energy, so wind and solar fits the bill.A growth opportunity for solar energyLet's take the Oroville Dam as an example of the challenge and   opportunity for utilities, grid operators, and renewable energy.   If the 819 MW dam were to be taken offline, it would take about   3.5 GW of solar (which only produces energy about a quarter of   the time) to fill the gap. That compares to 14.6 GW being   installed in all of 2016, according to GTM Research, so large   dams are incredibly important to the country's electricity   infrastructure overall.But it wouldn't be crazy to think that over the course of the   next decade or two some of these hydro plants will be   decommissioned as they age. And to replace all hydro, about 114   GW of solar or wind would need to be installed to replace clean   energy with clean energy. RPSs would demand that wind and solar   would fill the gap, not fossil fuels.That's an incredible potential opportunity for developers likeFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , whether they're building solar plants or energy   storage to provide more predictable power output.The crumbling infrastructure opportunityWhat's going on at the Oroville Dam has an impact on years'   worth of energy planning, especially if the spillway collapses.   In California's RPS structure, a large hydroelectric dam couldn't   be taken offline without eventually being replaced by renewable   energy sources like wind and solar. And when you consider the   sheer age of the hydro infrastructure in the U.S., it could   create a huge hole other sources of renewable energy would need   to fill.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model 3: How Many Will Be Delivered In 2017?;2/17/2017;"Going into electric-car makerTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings release, here's the   biggest question: How many Model 3 vehicles will management say   it expects to deliver during the year? After all, we already know   Tesla has about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the   $35,000 vehicles. But the big mystery is how Tesla's Model 3   production ramp-up will look -- and thus Model 3 deliveries.While investors may not get a very specific answer,   management's guidance range for total vehicle sales will likely   provide some useful insight into Tesla's outlook for the highly   anticipated, lower-cost vehicle.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Looking to guidanceIf Tesla follows its usual practice, it will provide an   outlook for expected full-year vehicle deliveries when it reports   itsfourth-quarter resultson Feb. 22, but it won't break down this forecast by model.   Still, investors can extrapolate from guidance for total   deliveries to get an idea of what management might expect from   Model 3.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long predicted it expects its   late-2015 launched Model X to eventually rival Model S   deliveries, bringing total Model S and Model X annual deliveries   to about 100,000 units. With this context, any guidance beyond   100,000 units in 2017 could presumably represent expected Model 3   deliveries.So, what sort of guidance range should investors expect from   Tesla management? While this may not be the answer investors are   hoping for, management will likely guide for a wide range of   possible outcomes. There's simply significant uncertainty   associated with forecasting a huge step change in vehicle   manufacturing.Musk explained the difficulty of forecasting Model 3   deliveries in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call:Another thing I really want to emphasize is the production     ramp tends to look like -- is exponential. Ultimately it is an     S-curve. An exponential goes to linear then goes to log. And     it's very difficult to predict exactly where that beginning     part of the exponential and the S-curve fits in between     quarterly reporting.A shift of even a few weeks one way or the other can have     quite a dramatic effect on what it looks like in that quarter,     but that's not indicative of the future. So we're telling you     what we -- we're giving you the best assessment we have short     of having a crystal ball.But Musk did provide some vision -- albeit very vague -- into   Tesla's expectations for Model 3, saying he thinks it will be an   ""exciting 2017."" Further, he said that Model 3 production will be   very uncertain in Q3 but ""gets pretty clear in Q4.""Why Tesla's guidance mattersShould investors even take Tesla's guidance seriously? I think   so.It's worth noting that, despite Tesla's well-documented   tendency to miss targets, its recent misses are relatively small   in relation to its rapidly growing targets. Even more, the   percentage gap between Tesla's initial annual guidance in recent   years and its actual deliveries isn't growing, despite extreme   growth in its targets.YearInitial GuidanceActual Vehicle DeliveriesDifference201320,00022,44212.2%201435,00031,655(9.6%)201555,00050,658(7.9%)201680,000-90,000*76,230(10.3%*)Total195,000180,985(7.2%)Asterisk indicates figure is calculated using a midpoint of a   guidance range. Table by author.Sure, there will likely be more uncertainty associated with   Tesla's guidance for 2017 deliveries than in previous years given   the guesswork even management will need to employ to predict   Model 3 deliveries. But Tesla's history of small misses on big   growth targets gives investors good reason to at least expect its   guidance to reflect a likelytrajectoryfor actual vehicle deliveries in 2017.Wait! What about those Model X delays?When forecasting Tesla's Model 3 production ramp-up in 2017   and beyond, it's probably tempting for investors to look to   Tesla's Model X delays and production challenges as a forewarning   for Model 3 production troubles. But there are several issues   with this reasoning.First, unlike the Model X, the Model 3 was designed from the   ground up for high-volume production. Second, the Model X is   an insanely complex vehicle, featuring never-before-manufactured   features like falcon wing doors, self-presenting front doors, the   largest front windshield in any vehicle, and monopost seats.Further, the Model X is the first fully-electric SUV ever   built. Indeed, it's arguably a borderline miracle that Tesla was   even able to achieve an annualized production run rate of 40,000   Model X units by the end of 2016.Model X. Image source: Author.In Tesla's third-quarter earnings call last year, Musk   specifically warned investors not to look to Model X as an   example of how Model 3 production could turn out:It's always tempting for people to reason by analogy instead     of first principles. And that would be the mistake of assuming     that anything to do with the X production has bearing on the     Model 3.They are very different programs with completely different     approaches. So I would not try to extrapolate from that, any     more than it would've made sense to extrapolate from the     Roadster when we were making 600 cars a year, to 20,000 cars a     year with the Model S....If you were to extrapolate from the Roadster experience, you     would be completely wrong about the Model S outcome, and many     people were. That's why I would say X is not relevant.Interestingly, for the first full calendar year of Model S   deliveries, Tesla actually exceeded its initial guidance for   20,000 vehicles, delivering 22,500 units. While achieving the   same sort of surprising outcome at Tesla's higher-volume   production today won't be easy, management is clearly confident   in a very steep production ramp-up for Model 3.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.Another year of 50% growth?I'll be expecting Tesla to provide a guidance range of   approximately 110,000 to 130,000 units, representing about 50%   year-over-year growth in deliveries and around 10,000 to 30,000   Model 3 deliveries. However, since Tesla is expecting its   annualized production to increase from a run rate of 100,000   units today to an incredible 500,000 units in 2018, only 110,000   to 130,000 deliveries in 2017 would mean Tesla's first and second   quarter of 2018 will need to be characterized by the steep   portion of the S-curve.But this is how S-curves look. First, they're gradual; then,   they suddenly rise.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Five Major Myths about Options Trading;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();When it comes to investing, pretty much everyone has an opinion. While those opinions are great, sometimes investors will spread myths about subjects they don't have a firm understanding of. One of the most confusing subjects isoptions trading. Due to the many moving parts involved, investors find themselves befuddled and not knowing where to start. Here I'm going to debunk five major myths of options trading.Myth #1: Options are Riskier than StocksThis is one of those broad-based, blanket statements that does not tell the whole truth. People think options are riskier because you can lose 100% of your investment in an option. However, you can use options to limit your risk on trades.Here's an example, let's say you wanted to buy 100 shares ofTesla (TSLA)ahead of their earnings report next week because you think they are going to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goes down 10% on its earnings report, you are going to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goes up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goes down 10% and stays there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goes up 10%, you're call option will be worth at least $2,700, maybe more. If you wanted to define your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, controlling 200 shares of Tesla rather than only 100. Same amount of nominal risk, but now your upside potential is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophisticated Trader for OptionsThere certainly are options strategies that involve a great deal of complexity. With so many choices available to trade it can be very complicated. Each options expiration date has call options and put options of varying strikes available. At first glance the selection process can be daunting. Many stocks now have weekly options expiration, making these even more overwhelming for investors.You don't need a PhD in Applied Mathematics to use simple options strategies to make money and create income. For example, buying a call in the hopes that a stock goes up. If you know there is an event coming up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goes up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefits when the stock goes down, you can buy a put option in the hopes the stock goes down. Start with the basics and add more complex strategies as you become more comfortable.Myth #3: It Takes a Lot of Money to Trade OptionsThis couldn't be further from the truth. It's a lot less capital intensive to trade options than it is to buy 100 shares of your favorite stock. Most brokerage firms allow you to sell options premium, a more advanced strategy, in accounts that contain as little as $2,000. Compare that to Pattern Day Trader accounts which require at least $25,000.Trading options allows smaller accounts to gain exposure to more stocks for less money. You can diversify your options trades across many industries and many stocks simultaneously. There are even options on ETFs like theVolatility Index (VXX)so you can gain exposure to exotic financial instruments while managing your risk.Myth #4: Time is Always Working Against YouIf you are long or buy options then yes, there is a time value element that's working against you. However, there are simple ways to flip the script so this time works in your favor. One way is by using long call and long put spreads rather than buying a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-legged options trade where a closer to the money option is purchased to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. This helps to drop the overall net debit or price of the call spread. It also limits the total profit potential of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead (GILD)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upside potential would be unlimited but my breakeven would be the strike price plus the net debit which in this case is $2.95, making my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believe Gilead's upside is limited to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expiration and take back some money, dropping my overall cost on the spread, therefore bringing down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is only $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Another example is the credit spread. Rather than buying the aforementioned spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spending $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 difference in the strike prices, minus the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. This credit spread would max out or give me the largest possible winning outcome of $2.40 if shares of GILD closed at or below $62.50 at expiration on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an options risk acknowledgement form and get your account approved specifically for options trading, it's not exactly a ""special account."" Pretty much any non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is eligible for options trading. I specify non-qualified because accounts like IRAs are restricted as to the type of options trading you can do since you can't short stocks in retirement accounts.There are several levels of options approvals out there, designed to save investors from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, only allowing certain types of trading. Each broker has their own guidelines for what these levels look like. All you really need for approval is experience trading and capital. It's not like you have to be a millionaire or anything.Bottom LineThose are the five biggest myths about options trading that scare off potential traders. If you take the time to learn more about trading options, you'll find that they are a great way to manage your risk and gain exposure to the stock market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch Next Week;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500 is currently worth $20 trillion for the first time ever, after gaining 25% over the last 12 months, and the Dow is inching quickly toward its own new all-time high. But, tech stocks have outperformed even more over the past year, with the Nasdaq posting 34% gains over the comparable time period.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrOf course, there's been plenty of variance in performance for individual stocks, while the tech world comes with even more risks and question marks. Next week, three big tech names - electric automakerTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), payments platformSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) and wearables leaderFitBit Inc(NYSE:FIT) - will all report numbers for their most recent quarters on the same day: Feb. 22.Here's what investors should watch.3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla has been on fire of late, gaining 60% over the last year and 27% just a month and a half into 2017. But, that momentum actually spurred a sell-off yesterday. Well, more specifically, it spurred a ""sell"" call from UBS analyst Colin Langan, which investors took to heart to the tune of a nearly 4% one-day drop.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post a loss of 35 cents per share. While that's a smaller loss than what the company posted a year ago, Wall Street was actually expecting a profit as of three months ago.Plus, all estimates for TSLA stock have been getting worse. The loss on tap for next quarter has quadrupled in just three months; the loss on tap for next year has gone from 33 cents to $1.18. Thus, even an earnings beat would come over a lowered bar, which might act as an anchor on any potential pop.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to GoFurther, while Tesla topped Wall Street's expectations last quarter, it missed by a wide margin the three prior. Langan said that he expects risk as a result of the company'sSolarCityacquisition, calling it a distraction from Model 3 test production, slated to begin on Feb. 20.3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Square (SQ)Square has also posted significant gains over the last 12 months, but in a slightly more dramatic fashion. SQ shares fell around 40% last spring, just six months after Square hit the public markets. But, the stock has been climbing out of that hole ever since. Add it up, and Square stock has still managed to gain upward of 50% in a year and is approaching its old highs.Source:Via SquareWill earnings be enough to propel Square to never-before-seen levels? The company has posted an ""earnings"" beat in the two most recent quarters - although there have been no earnings in sight, technically. Square is not yet profitable and is again on tap for a loss, this time to the tune of 7 cents per share.Investors betting on SQ are likely hoping for a buyout, though, making earnings less important than they would be for more established, profitable tech companies. Or they're playing the super long game, betting on the mega-trend of payments. Still, if the numbers disappoint widely, expect many folks who have just regained their losses to take the money and run3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Fitbit (FIT)While Tesla and Square both dropped a bit yesterday, Fitbit posted a nice 2% one-day gain. That's the good news. The bad news is that, unlike shares of the previous two companies, FIT stock has generally been headed nowhere but down.Source:Via FitbitFitbit stock has lost more than 56% of its value over the last 12 months, and that's just the extension of a trend that's existed for the last five years.And, FIT stock is moving in the wrong direction because, well, everything has been. This quarter, for instance, earnings are expected to end up 5 cents in the red vs. a profit three times as large the same time last year. Just three months ago, Wall Street was actually expecting earnings growth, too. Now, analysts expect the loss to come on the back of a 19% sales decline.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win AgainFitbit is facing tough competition in the wearables space, and that's just the beginning of its problems. On top of that, the company is facing a legal battle withJawbone, which alleges the former stole employees and trade secrets. Translation: It's going to take a lot to regain investor confidence - i.e. more than one earnings report.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

3 Vanguard Treasury Bond Funds to Consider;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you want to invest in government bonds with Vanguard funds, there are a few primary ways to do it. You can invest in one of three Vanguard treasury bond funds, invest in one of their agency bond funds or invest in a Vanguard index fund that covers all types of government bond funds.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Today we'll focus on Vanguard funds that hold U.S. Treasury bonds. The three types of treasury bond funds that Vanguard offers are categorized by the primary bond durations, which include short term, intermediate term and long term.Investors who buy treasury bond funds are usually looking for exposure to a basket of bonds with high credit quality, which means the objective that suits this need is one of conservative income.In translation, investors looking for high yields aren't typically buyers of treasury bond funds.Vanguard Treasury Bond Mutual FundsVanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VFISX): Vanguard's VFISX fund invests in U.S. Treasury bills, which are short-term bonds with durations that average about two years. Short-term treasury bonds typically have higher yields than money market funds but lower interest-rate risk than intermediate- and long-term bonds. Although they're not without market risk, short-term treasury bonds can be a good fixed-income choice for conservative investors. Expenses are 0.2% and the minimum initial investment is $3,000.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayVanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VFITX): Vanguard's VFITX holds government debt in the form of intermediate-term U.S. Treasuries, which have an average duration of 5.3 years. Intermediate-term bond funds make good core holdings for the fixed-income portion of a portfolio because they generally kick off higher yields than short-term bond funds and carry less interest rate risk than long-term bond funds. The expenses for VFITX are 0.2% and the minimum initial investment is $3,000.Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VUSTX): Vanguard's VUSTX invests in a basket of long-term Treasuries that average more than 15 years in duration. Over the long haul, investors can expect VUSTX to produce higher yields and better annual returns than its short- and intermediate-term counterparts, but they'll have to accept higher interest-rate risk along with them. For example, when interest rates are rising, prices for long-term bond funds tend to fall further than those with shorter average durations. VUSTX has an expense ratio of 0.2% and has a minimum initial investment of $3,000.As of this writing, Kent Thune did not personally hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.His No. 1 holding is his privately heldinvestment advisory firm.Under no circumstances does this information represent a recommendation to buy or sell securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%The post3 Vanguard Treasury Bond Funds to Considerappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) may not be competitors, but you can trade them as if they are. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();I am a fundamentally driven trader. Meaning I like to set my risk based on solid fundamentals. Tesla and Twitter are both perceived as risky bets. This is not a slight against either of them; I am merely saying that their fundamentals have yet to grow into their valuations. Tesla has a few obstacles ahead it. I get the potential but for now it's a speculative play in my book.A few days ago I suggestedclosing TSLA long profits and roll into TWTR longs. I did so because I didn't have room for both speculative trades in my portfolio. The move turned out to be an instant win as that day marked the high in TSLA and a coincided with a spike in TWTR.Click to EnlargeTesla Stock has a cult following. But on Thursday it caught a downgrade that caused a 3.9% drop.It won't be long before TSLA fans start touting great entry points. Personally, I reiterate my skepticism in its fundamentals so I won't be buying the stock.3 Dow Jones Stocks That Are Weighing You DownOn the other hand, I remain a fan of the TSLA stock price action. So, I like selling risk in Tesla options.I am always looking for opportunities to cautiously catch the falling knife. The easiest way I can do it is by repeating what has worked in TSLA, which is to sell risk against extreme opinions. I am not reckless so I always leave plenty of room for error since I never assume that I will pick the perfect time of entry. In this case, I will nibble with a first tranche trade then add to it as price unfolds.The Trade:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $11.50 to open. The 30% price buffer gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success. My breakeven point is $173.5 per share. Selling naked puts is dangerous and is not suitable for all investors especially on a speculative high-priced stock. So I can modify this trade to carry less overall dollars at risk.The Alternate:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185/$180 credit put spread. For this collect $1 to open. If successful, this trade yields more than 25% on money risked. Selling a spread limits my maximum risk to the width of the spread less what I collect to open.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Ready for a BreakoutI am not required to carry these trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses. Selling naked puts is dangerous especially in markets hovering at all time highs. I only do it if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Tata Motors recently reported results for the quarter ended Dec 31, 2016. The company's consolidated profit after tax for the quarter plunged 96.2% year over year.

The JLR business witnessed weaker product mix and lower wholesale volumes in the quarter.The company's commercial vehicles segment also saw lower demand due to the demonetization of high-value currencies in India. Management expects the JLR segment margins to be better in the next quarter, supported by new launches. However, it continues to face the risks related to Brexit as JLR units are primarily manufactured in the U.K. as well as the border tax that is being considered by the Trump administration.Tata Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Closing the Deal With Time Warner Inc (TWX) Is a Must for AT&T Inc. (T);2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThough the intended merger ofTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) has beendoubted more than once since the idea was first floated in October, CEO Randall Stephenson assured AT&T stock owners that,not only would the deal be done this year, it would be ushered through without so much as a review by the FCC (as it turns out, AT&T isn't looking to garner Time Warner's licenses).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrIs he right, and more importantly, do owners of T stock still want the TWX deal to go through? AT&T has so much else on its plate right now, not the least of which is regulatory uncertainty.As it turns out, not only is the pairing likely to win approval, AT&T needs it…badly.Business Is Getting TougherOn Friday, Stephenson said it bluntly, though accurately -wireless carriers are in an arms race. While he was specifically referencing the industry's capability to deliver digital constant over a limited number of airwave frequencies, his assessment could just as easily apply to the mechanics of delivering a wireless service.Case in point: On Monday, rivalVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it wasre-introducing unlimited data plans, looking to garner (or recapture) wireless customers who have come to rely on handheld devices as media-delivery vehicles.AT&T will be forced to respond, which - one way or another - will stake money off the bottom line.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteAs T stock owners likely know all too well, there's no room for give. Last quarter,the company's revenue fell just a bit. Income fell considerably.The rise in operating expenses is abated after factoring in amortization and merger-related, but in light of the fact that theacquisition of DirecTV in May 2014was supposed to be a business building tool, anything but top-line growth is a disappointment - and a reflection of an increasingly competitive space.Is Time Warner the Answer?In other words, as wireless telecom service increasingly becomes a commodity and, as a result, becomes less profitable, what's AT&T to do to rekindle growth?Whether it's the best use of time and money remains to be seen, but the telecom giant believes the acquisition of video and music company Time Warner is the next best step.Those plans wereunveiled in October, with mixed responses. While investors love the idea of melding a studio with a new distribution channel, consumers and regulators were a bit more skeptical. The concern lies in the fact that such a pairing wouldgive AT&T not just control of how we consume media(AT&T is the nation's second-biggest wireless provider and third-biggest broadband service provider), but what media we even have access to. Time Warner is theparent of several key television channelsincluding HBO and CNN, as well as studio Warner Bros.Though it's technically a vertical integration and would theoretically be a mere coincidental pairing of content creation and content delivery, the opportunity for unfairness is undeniable even though pairing the media and the messenger would create efficiencies. Stephenson doesn't believe the union violates any antitrust standards, however, and not just because the team-up wouldn't include Time Warner's licenses.And if last quarter's results for Time Warner are any indication, owners of AT&T stock should be hoping the deal goes through. In its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the company earned $1.25 per share on revenue of $7.89 billion. Analysts were only looking for a profit of $1.19 per share and a top line of $7.75 billion. Both figures were up by double digits versus year-ago comparisons, and the Q4 report extends a long and pretty reliable string of growth.In other words, AT&T could use what Time Warner's got.Bottom Line for AT&T StockThe good news is, the merger with Time Warner is apt to proceed as planned, andthat's coming from a former FCC commissioner. The vertical-integration nature of the pairing rather than a horizontal one is the key.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideWhile the philosophical concerns of a potential monopoly aren't without merit, legally speaking, AT&T is right… there's no specific reason to assume that the company will abuse its relationship with a studio by limiting access to third-party entities. It's certainly pushing the envelope though. It's unlikely that antitrust law foresaw where communications technology and choice was going, with the lines between medium and media being this blurred.Either way, AT&T wants, and needs, this deal to get done.As of this writing, James Brumley held a position in AT&T (T).More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsTake Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR)The postClosing the Deal With Time Warner Inc (TWX) Is a Must for AT&T Inc.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn’t Done Correcting Yet;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBusiness forNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be firing on all cylinders, but the charts of NVDA stock are showing a trend in motion that's a wee bit top-heavy. Thus, if you're looking to get on board one of the hottest stocks of the past year, I have a trade idea that helps discount some of the hype.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf we're to believe Nvidia's latest earnings report, it just doesn't get any better. It was a""great finish to a record year""as the company topped forecasts and bumped up guidance.But there lies the rub. NVDA stock is faced with the possibility of becoming a victim of its own success onandoff the price chart.Longer-term, Nvidia appears to be in all the right markets poised for secular growth. From autonomous vehicles to gaming to virtual reality to cloud computing, NVDA is well-positioned for continued success. You'll get no argument from me here.But Nvidia's success isn't exactly a secret at this point, and that's becoming a growing problem. For one, there's an inflated price for admission, with Nvidia stock sporting lofty ratios such as a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33, price-to-sales of 8.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 3.4.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingPlus, NVDA now faces rising operating costs, potential gross margin compression, as well as data center, custom silicon and GPU workarounds competition.Nvidia could prove a very costly investment.Failing that, the chart of NVDA stock is warning that a day of reckoning is nigh.Nvidia Stock ChartClick to EnlargeWith NVDA shares up roughly 300% in the past 52 weeks, traders buying shares today are placing a lot of technical faith in extreme momentum continuing, rather than an overdue cycle of profit-taking beginning.In my view, bullishness at Nvidia's current price is misplaced.After 10 months of price action remaining tethered to Nvidia's upper Bollinger Band, shares are forming a bearish topping candle on the monthly chart. That's after hitting a brief and marginal all-time high in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report.Even the best-sounding, well-supported growth narratives eventually give way to meaningful price corrections, even if they eventually resume their rallies. I don't expect Nvidia stock to be an anomaly to that durable tendency.How to Trade NVDA Stock Right NowOne strategy that could allow you to profit from a correction in Nvidia and/or buy shares at a discount is an out-of-the-money credit put spread.I suggest the March $100/$95 put vertical.Trade of the Day: Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Waves a Bull FlagNVDA stock is at $108.90, and the trade is priced at 60 cents. The spread collects the full credit as long as shares aren't below $100 at expiration. That would require a decline of more than 8%, which would put Nvidia's total correction at 17%.We're looking to get paid as Nvidia diffuses its overbought condition. At the same time, the vertical does limit risk to $4.40 if the stock were to establish a stiffer correction below the protective $95 put strike.If we ultimately want to buy NVDA stock on weakness, the most we'll pay is $99.40.Also, if Nvidia establishes a larger (but still commonly corrective) move of 30% to $84.50 during the life of this vertical, the worst-case scenario is that our initial purchase price would work out to $89.90 through either assignment, or closing the spread and buying NVDA stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

4 Stocks to Buy Near 52-Week Lows;2/15/2017;"With U.S. stock markets trading near their all-time highs,   many companies' valuations have become a bit stretched. But there   arealwaysbargains to be found if you are willing to turn over enough   rocks. We asked a team of Fools to highlight a stock trading near   its 52-week low that they think is worth buying today. Read on to   see why they pickedAmerican Outdoor Brands(NASDAQ: AOBC) ,Gilead Sciences(NASDAQ: GILD) ,CVS Health(NYSE: CVS) , andFord(NYSE: F) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();This stock is under fire, but it's fighting backDan Caplinger(American Outdoor Brands): American Outdoor Brands isn't a familiar name to most   investors, but the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson   is well known as a premier gun manufacturer. The company decided   to change its name to highlight that it makes a variety of other   products in addition to its extensive gun offerings, such as   laser sighting systems, knives, tree saws, and tactical lighting   products. Moreover, American Outdoor Brands produces gun vaults   and accessories, along with gunsmithing and reloading tools.American Outdoor Brands has seen its stock fall recently, in   large part because of the results of the U.S. presidential   election in November. Many believed that the stock would climb if   the Democratic candidate had won, with expectations of stricter   gun control restrictions leading many gun enthusiasts to make   purchases prior to any such regulations taking effect. However,   with the victory of President Trump, the urgency among gun buyers   is gone, and investors fear that American Outdoor Brands will see   sales suffer as a result.However, American Outdoor Brands' strategy to emphasize its   broader product line should help it sustain growth in the long   run. Even if sales fall now, American Outdoor Brands has the   quality and brand awareness to prosper for long-term   investors.The cash to cure what ails itMatt DiLallo(Gilead Sciences): Shares of biotech giant Gilead Sciences have   stumbled over the past year, dropping more than 35%. The stock   recently hit another 52-week low after reporting disappointing   fourth-quarter earnings, with no clear signs of a turnaround in   sight. The culprit is declining sales of its hepatitis C   franchise, which isn't expected to turn around anytime soon.That said, Gilead still managed to generate a whopping $16.7   billion of operating cash flow last year. It returned most of   that cash to shareholders, buying back $11 billion in stock and   paying $2.5 billion in dividends. The company also recently   increased the dividend by 10% thanks to that copious cash flow.   Even with those increasing shareholder returns, the company was   able to add to its cash position, which stood at $32.4 billion at   the end of last year.That cash position might be just the medicine that cures the   company's ailing sales because it could use it to make a   meaningful acquisition, such as acquiring a company with a   compelling late-stage drug pipeline or a fast-selling drug. If   Gilead can find the right deal, it could halt the stock's slide   by giving investors a reason to be optimistic that sales   can grow once again.Political attention = opportunityBrian Feroldi(CVS Health): Changes are coming to the Affordable Care Act, while   politicians have been accusing pharmacy benefit managers such as   CVS Health for driving up the cost of drugs. Mix in competitive   pressure that caused the company tocut its guidance, and it is easy to understand why CVS's shares have been tossed   into the discount bin.While 2017 looks as if it'sgoing to be a wash, I can't help feeling good about this company's prospects over   the long term. Baby boomers are retiring in droves, which should   drive prescription volume growth for years to come. CVS Health's   in-store MinuteClinics are a hit with consumers, and there's   plenty of room left for expansion. TheTargetand Omnicare integrations are going well, and sales of specialty   drugs are growing nicely. That's a lot of good things happening   for a stock trading near its 52-week low.Meanwhile, the company continues to crank out cash flow that   it generously passes back to shareholders in the form of a rising   dividend and share buybacks. Yet CVS Health's depressed share   price has pulled its valuation down to 13.5 times forward   earnings. With a strong competitive position and a market-beating   yield of 2.5%, this is a terrific stock to buy at today's   dirt-cheap valuation.The forgotten automakerTravis Hoium(Ford): Automakers not namedTeslaare having a hard time getting any love in today's stock market.   Ford has made vast improvements in the quality and attractiveness   of its vehicles since the recession subsided, and now it's   churning profits quarter after quarter. And no one seems to   care.F Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsWhat's impressive about Ford today is that it's profiting from   the market's trends (SUVs and trucks) while investing in future   technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving.   Don't mistake the fact that Ford isn't showing off the latest   0-to-60 times as a sign that it's falling behind: Ford is working   on autonomous vehicles in a big way.The company recently showed off its second-generation   autonomous Ford Fusion, a surprisingly normal-looking vehicle,   and invested $1 billion in Argo AI to develop commercial   ride-sharing fleets by 2021. On top of that, 90 autonomous Ford   Fusions will be on the road this year across the U.S. and   potentially Europe, refining autonomous technology.Ford is a leading automaker of the future, while still being a   cash machine today. And that's a big reason investors should love   the stock near its 52-week low.10 stocks we like better than Gilead SciencesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Move Over China: India's the Best Place to Invest Right Now;2/14/2017;"(1:30) - Apple to begin iPhone manufacturing in India(6:15) - Tesla speculates opening the doors into India's   Market(9:15) - Internet Expansion   in India(13:35) - Amazon's Big Investment into India(21:30) - India's influencing infrastructure(25:25) - Stock Re-capWelcome to Episode #70 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Neena Mishra, Zacks Director of ETF Research and also the editor ofZacks Income Investor.But she's not on the show this week to talk about ETFs or income stocks. No, she's joining Tracey to discuss a far more important topic: the investing opportunities in India.Neena just returned from a trip to India where she noticed that there was a lot more optimism about the economy.Prime Minister Modi has been trying to institute economic reforms to open up India's economy, which has been notoriously closed off to foreign investment. Given the developments over the last few years, it looks like he is succeeding.While many American technology and social media companies are shut out of China for various reasons, India has seemingly opened its doors. With 1.2 billion people, and growing, many companies would love to tap that consumer base.With one of the largest populations of Millennials in the world, and a growing middle class, 2017 could be the year of India.Tracey and Neena discuss 5 ways in which investors can invest in India's rising economic power, without even leaving the shores of the United States.5 Stocks to Play the Indian Growth Story1.AppleAAPLonly has 2% of India's smartphone market. Estimated at 300 million, and growing, that's just a small sliver of the market. But until 2017, it hasn't been able to open Apple retail stores in the country. Thanks to a deal to manufacture the phones in India, which will bring costs of the phones down for consumers, Apple could soon be tapping India's growing elite.2.TeslaTSLAappears to be poised to enter the India market after CEO Elon Musk tweeted out in February 2017 that it is looking to enter India in mid-2017. There are also rumors that a long-awaited Tesla Asia manufacturing plant may get the green light in India, instead of China. Stay tuned.3.FacebookFBhas long been shut out of the massive Chinese market, but that's not the case in India. One problem in India, however, has been the poor Internet infrastructure. There are just 250 million data subscribers, although that number is growing quickly. In 2016, Facebook tried to give away the Internet in India but was shot down by the government. However, data companies have been quickly expanding which is helping Facebook's reach. In the fourth quarter of last year, India was Facebook's fastest growing market.4.AmazonAMZNhas put the most on the line in India as it has already spent about $5 billion to expand its fulfillment centers and delivery service in the country. Amazon Prime has launched in 100 cities. 10% of India's population speaks English, which makes it the second largest English speaking country, after the United States, in the world. It's facing competition, however, from Alibaba and homegrown FlipKart and Snapdeal. But it has launched Amazon Video and a recent 3-day Great Indian Sale saw sales growth surge over 200% compared to a regular shopping day.5.NetflixNFLXhas an aggressive international expansion plan, and it includes India. In December 2016, just as Amazon Video launched, Netflix announced a partnership with Bollywood movie star and producer, Shah Rukh Khan. Right now, Neena says Netflix is charging around $10 a month for its streaming service. That is high for India. But, again, companies are looking at the growth potential.What else should you know about India and investing in its hot growth story in 2017?Find out the answers to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitmakeArticleAd();Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Tesla Shares Near Record High As It Reaffirms Mass-Market Model 3 Production;2/14/2017;"Tesla, Inc.TSLA, formerly Tesla Motors, Inc., shares neared an all-time high on Monday after the electric car manufacturer reaffirmed its plans to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, in late 2017.Tesla shares rose 4% Monday, and it is up 2.76% in Tuesday trading to $283.46. Now, the company, which nearly fell off a cliff in February 2016, looks poised to regain some momentum ahead of its biggest undertaking to date.Tesla will reportedly start to buildpre-production versions of its $35,000 Model 3 sedan in mid-2017, as the company attempts to begin fulfilling the 373,000 pre-orders. Consumers placed faith in Elon Musk's company by putting down $1,000 deposits for the new vehicles starting in Spring 2016. Tesla plans to roll out the Model 3 all the way through 2018.Model S third quarter sales jumped 59%in the U.S. year-over-year, claiming nearly a third of the luxury sedan market. Overall,fourth quarter sales rose 27%.Despite falling just short of its goal to deliver 80,000 vehicles,Morgan Stanley analysts placed their faith in Teslalast month. And since December, Tesla shares have risen by nearly 60%.Musk, Tesla's chairman and largest shareholder stated his hopes to produce 500,000 electric vehicles a year by the end of 2018 and 1 million by 2020.Other MovesThe company announced on Monday it isready to enter the Middle East market. Tesla will begin to accept online orders for its Model S sedan and Model X SUV from the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is expected to get a Tesla pop-up store and a service center by July. Tesla has similar plans for Abu Dhabi by 2018. The move puts the company in the potentially large Middle Eastern luxury car market.Oil prices have fallen in the last two years, which could prompt a shift in regional driving practices. UAE just announced a free-to-use electric vehicle road with charging stations.Musk is currently being courted to bring a Tesla plant to his home country of South Africa. And he recently announced intentions tobring Tesla to India.Tesla has also started to invest in sustainability far beyond electric cars.Its $2.1 billion acquisition of solar power giant SolarCity has allowed the company to expand its business model. Tesla is now investing heavily in solar power and sustainable battery technology in order to expand its new energy business.And Musk wants to begin tocolonize Mars by 2024. So conquering the electric car market doesn't seem all that difficult by comparison.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Tesla;2/14/2017;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 48 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) was held by 16 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in TSLA positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Fort Point Capital Partners LLCExisting-3,222-$508Reynders McVeigh Capital Management LLCNEW+1,543+$330California State Teachers Retirement       SystemExisting+8,900+$4,319Jaffetilchin Investment Partners LLCExisting+3,560+$1,019Blue Ridge Capital L.L.C.ExistingUNCH+$1,558Graticule Asia Macro Advisors LLCNEW-27,000-$5,770Marathon Trading Investment Management       LLCExisting-3,428-$751IFP Advisors IncExisting+383+$118Moon Capital Management LPNEW-10,000-$2,137Lenox Wealth Management Inc.ExistingUNCH+$3Bamco Inc.

Worth noting is thatHoplite Capital Management L.P., included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited TSLA common stock as of 12/31/2016.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the TSLA share count in the aggregate amongallof the funds which held TSLA at the 12/31/2016 reporting period (out of the 2,765 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of TSLA shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for TSLA. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 5,356,450 shares in the aggregate, from 51,255,183 up to 56,611,633 for a share count increase of approximately 10.45%.

Go Long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock … With Insurance!;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year's turnaround inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is back in play and looking good for investors. But with key product rollouts looming, don't be too Zen about the trend being your friend. Instead, control your destiny with a little insurance against AMD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAs I wrotelast monthin front of earnings, 2016 was the best of times for AMD stock, and for good reason. Of course, 2017 is looking good as shares continue to gain on the company's improving business trend. Shares were catapulted to new multiyear highs after fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street's views.Still, the rest of the year is looking like make-or-break time for the semiconductor outfit for two reasons: Ryzen and Vega.Ryzen is set to be released in early March as Advanced Micro Devices' new CPU for PCs and servers. The main competition is chip giantIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) - a company facing itsown design challengesand whose manufacturing lead will shrink markedly with the release of Ryzen.On the conference call, Advanced Micro Devices teased investors, stating it had secured a number of high-end PC design wins for Ryzen, which is based on AMD's next-gen Zen CPU core architecture.Advanced Micro Devices is also releasing its Vega GPU line in 2017. The product is expected to come to market during the second quarter and has its sights on gaining market share in the server and high-end PC markets.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe big competition in this space isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia's software dominance will be a substantial challenge for AMD to crack, but one it's readying for with an open-source approach.Advanced Micro Devices must successfully execute for AMD stock to have any chance to keep building on its red-hot 2017. If not, it would undo a significant amount of price action.AMD Stock ChartClick to EnlargeSince discussing AMD back in January (yellow oval highlight), shares have confirmed what we saw as a fairly common corrective move by blasting higher to new multiyear highs.It goes without saying that the price action has been very generous for AMD investors. But notwithstanding the company's obvious business risks, there's no reason to believe the stock's bullish trend won't still be friendly, and won't still improve.The better part of last week has been spent digesting the bullish gains in AMD stock, though not to point of finding support from an overbought stochastics. It's a minor concern. My technical point of view? AMD's constructive price action and potential for improvement outweighs this secondary price indicator.How to Trade AMD Stock Right NowWith AMD stock at $13.58, I like the April $17/$12 collar.The collar - priced for $13.78, or 20 cents over a naked long stock purchase - allows for guaranteed downside protection at $12 and amounts to an effective stop-loss of about 13%.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman's $150 TargetThe insurance policy afforded by the $12 put is stationed a few percent below December's highs in AMD and pennies under the post-earnings closing print. The protection could come in handy.If bullish momentum does prevail, profits are initially capped by the $17 call. At April expiration, that works out to a gain of more than 23% if shares are at or above the sold strike. Those profits nearly double the downside risk for a premium of just 20 cents.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

(ATVI);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trending higher this morning, as Wall Street looks toward softening trade rhetoric from the White House on Japan and China. Furthermore, while there is a lack of economic data, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On the corporate front,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is making headlines after offering its first unlimited wireless data plan since 2011.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.27%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.16%.On the options front, volume was brisk on Friday, with about 17.3 million calls and 14.8 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.70, but the 10-day moving average ticked lower to 0.70.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw mixed options activity and dropped 2.4% on Friday despite posting record holiday quarter earnings results. Meanwhile,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) puts were active after the company logged its 10th straight year-over-year drop in quarterly revenue andActivision Blizzard, Inc.(NASDAQ:ATVI) announced blowout results and a $1 billion buyback program.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Nvidia traders were looking for a reason - any reason - to take profits off the table after the stock returned to all-time-high territory near $120 last week. And they got it inThursday night's quarterly report. Despite record earnings of 99 cents per share and sales of $2.2 billion - both of which beat Wall Street's targets of 83 cents per share on revenue of $2.1 billion - traders instead focused on Nvidia's conservative first-quarter guidance of $1.9 billion (plus or minus two percentage points), versus expectations for $1.88 billion.NVDA stock dropped nearly 2.4%, pushing the shares below their 10-day moving average and driving heavy put volume heading into the weekend. In total, NVDA saw 828,000 contracts cross the tape on Friday, with puts and calls nearly split on the session.That said, NVDA is still trading north of peak Feb call and put open interest at $110, which totals 9,000 and 14,000 contracts, respectively. Additionally, while put adds were seen building at the Feb $107 strike, so too were traders targeting the Feb $115 call strike. Once profit taking plays out, NVDA should begin to move higher once again.Twitter Inc (TWTR)TWTR stock continued to see fallout from itsdisastrous fourth-quarter earnings report. The struggling social media firm logged its 10th straight year-over-year quarterly decline and its slowest revenue growth since it went public four years ago.Many TWTR bulls were hoping that Twitter would get a ""Trump bump"" from the political stir President Donald Trump has caused since his election, but ad revenue from the increased Twitter attention didn't materialize.The poor report sent many scrambling for the exits, and TWTR options traders flooded the stock with puts on Friday. Total volume rose to 609,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 55% of the day's take. Twitter is now trading at its lowest point since June last year, with the dip below $16 threatening to push the stock below peak Feb put OI of nearly 20,000 contracts at the $15 strike.And there are plenty of put traders looking for just such a break later this week, with 11,800 Feb $13 put contracts and another 7,200 puts open at the Feb $14 strike. TWTR stock is trading slightly higher in premarket action this morning, and it may be only a matter of time before takeover and buyout rumors start swirling once again.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI)With graphics chip makersAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia reporting record holiday profits, it should come as no surprise that one of the largest video game makers in the world would also post a blowout quarter. Activision Blizzard said itearned 92 cents per share in the fourth quarter, besting the consensus by 19 cents. Revenue also topped the Street's view, coming in at $2.45 billion.Trade of the Day: Play a Torrid Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock RallyBut while ATVI surged nearly 19% on Friday, options traders didn't appear to be chasing the stock. Total volume came in at 316,000 contracts, with calls only managing 52% of the day's take. In fact, puts easily outnumber calls in the Feb series, indicating that ATVI options traders are looking for a correction or a pullback in short order.That said, ATVI is trading well north of all major call and put OI in both the Feb and March series, and it could be a bit before options traders adjust to the stock's new perch in the $47 region.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc.

That came on revenues of $6.5 billion, which was more than enough to clear estimates of $6.25 billion, and represented 33% growth year-over-year.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveInvestors also were encouraged by Teva's full-year outlook, which included adjusted earnings of $4.90 to $5.30 on revenues of $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion. The lower end of each range was enough to beat expectations of $4.83 in profits on $23.69 billion in revs.Heading forward, Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg says the company will be focused on ""extracting synergies related to the Actavis Generics transaction,"" referring to the$40.5 billion buyout that closed last year.TEVA shares were up about 5% in Monday's premarket trade.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla has been making moves outside the U.S. as the electric carmaker seeks to become a force globally.TSLA is making waves in the Middle East as Tesla will make its official launch in Dubai at the same time as the World Government Summit in Dubai, which CEO Elon Musk will attend.The first Tesla store in Dubai will open this coming summer on Shiekh Zayed Road, ""one of the busiest roads in Dubai,"" according toElectrek.

Trade of the Day: Play a Torrid Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Rally;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Collins will return on Feb. 21.makeArticleAd();After closing higher in nine out of the past 10 weeks, shares ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) are fast approaching the all-time highs at the $290 level. Most of the recent near-parabolic move has been predicated on hopes for the ramp-up in production for the Model 3.Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)TSLA, however, has a history of over-promising and under-delivering. I think the stock has come too far, too fast and is ripe for a pullback.Certainly the stock has been huge performer since early December, tacking on a very impressive 50% gain in that time frame. Shares are reaching extremely overbought levels on a technical basis, with nine-day RSI readings over 85. Previous instances when Tesla stock reached such levels of euphoria proved to be short-term tops in the stock.TSLA is also positioned right at the critical $270 resistance level.A longer-term weekly technical take paints an even more ominous picture. The last four times Tesla was at such overbought levels on a weekly basis were significant tops in the stockMuch of the recent move higher in Tesla can likely be attributed to short covering. With short interest now dropping from the recent record highs, it will take more than short covering to propel TSLA to all-time highs.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveEarnings are due Feb. 22, withexpectations of a 30 cent loss on revenues of $2.2 billion. Important to remember that Tesla also missed delivery numbers in 2016, delivering only 76,000 cars versus guidance in the 80,000 to 90,000 range. Once again a case of the hope exceeding reality.With TSLA stock now just below the all-time highs at $290, the real question is how much is faith worth. Given that the stock is up 50% in less than three months and way overbought, I think faith at current levels is likely unwarranted.With IV elevated in front of earnings, short option strategies are favored.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaBuy TSLA 24 Feb $295 calls and sell 24 Feb $290 calls for a 65-cent net credit or better.Maximum gain is $65 per spread with maximum risk of $435 per spread. Return on risk is 15%. The short $290 strike provides a 6.8% upside cushion and is at the all-time highs for Tesla.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Tell us what you think about this article!

The Chevy Bolt EV Gets Off to a Strong Sales Start;2/12/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has talked about creating an   affordable electric car for more than a decade. That car -- the   Model 3 -- is finally taking shape. Test production could begin   within the next few weeks, and Tesla hopes tobegin mass production this summer. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of potential customers have   put down $1,000 refundable deposits to reserve a place in   line.However,General Motors(NYSE: GM) has beaten Tesla to the punch with its own affordable   electric car, the Chevy Bolt. The 2017 Chevy Bolt went on sale in   December and is selling quite well so far. It may not match the   Model 3 in terms of total sales, but the Bolt is on its way to   becoming a key part of GM's vehicle lineup.A bolt from the blueTesla has been talking up the Model 3 -- at least conceptually   -- for a very long time. A few years ago, it set 2017 as a target   for beginning production.makeArticleAd();Tesla still hopes to start delivering the Model 3 sedan     later this year. Image source: Tesla Motors.Thus, most industry observers were shocked when GM showcased   the Bolt concept car in early 2015 and then quickly confirmed   that it would go into production with an on-sale date of late   2016. This allowed the Chevy Bolt to make it to marketbefore the Model 3.The Chevy Bolt offers an impressive EPA-estimated 238 miles of   range. It has a starting price of $37,495 and is eligible for a   $7,500 federal tax credit. (Some states, including California,   offer additional tax credits.) Furthermore, most reviews of the   Bolt have been quite positive and have confirmed that the   advertised 238-mile range holds up in real-world driving   conditions.Strong sales out of the gateThe first Chevy Bolts arrived on dealer lots in December. GM   dealers delivered 579 Bolts to customers that month. In January,   availability improved modestly and sales doubled to 1,162   units.That may not seem like much compared to the nearly 200,000   vehicles GM dealers delivered in the U.S. during January.   However, the Bolt is only available in two states so far:   California and Oregon. (To be fair, electric vehicles are   particularly popular in those states.) Furthermore, inventory   remains extremely low, with Chevy Bolts spending just seven days   on dealers' lots on average.GM plans to gradually roll the Chevy Bolt out to more states   over the course of this year. It will be available in most West   Coast and Northeast markets by the spring, with nationwide   availability scheduled for September.The Chevy Bolt will be available nationwide by September.     Image source: General Motors.Considering the strong initial demand for the Bolt, sales   could far exceed anything the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt has   managed over the last six years. In 2016, GM delivered 24,739   Volts, which was a new record for the model.A key piece of the puzzleThe Chevy Bolt is likely to remain a relatively low-volume   model for GM. However, as the company's first fully electric car,   it could prove to be very important for the General.First, even if it isn't as cool as Tesla's Model 3, the Bolt   may serve as a halo car for the Chevrolet brand, improving its   image among environmentally conscious consumers and bringing more   people into dealerships.Second, if the Chevy Bolt sells relatively well, it will help   General Motors meet the EPA's aggressive fuel economy targets in   the coming years. Full-size trucks and SUVs generate the lion's   share of GM's profit and will continue to do so. However, in   order to continue churning out those gas-guzzlers, GM also has to   produce some fuel-efficient vehicles. With a 119 MPG-equivalent   rating, the Bolt goes a long way in this regard.Third, some states -- most notably, California -- require   automakers tobuy zero-emission vehicle creditsif they don't produce enough electric vehicles. The Chevy Bolt   should reduce or eliminate GM's need to buy these ZEV credits   from rivals like Tesla. (Not surprisingly, the Bolt will be   available in all 10 states on the ZEV credit system by May.)It's still early in the rollout of the Chevy Bolt. However, so   far, everything seems to be going to plan. As a General Motors   shareholder, I will be paying close attention to the Chevy Bolt's   sales trend as availability improves during the course of   2017.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In Case You Missed It, This Hasn't Happened in the Solar Industry in 16 Years;2/11/2017;"The solar industry has been on a growth streak for the past 16   years and is now a formidable force in energy. But this year may   finally see the growth streak come to an end.According toGTM Research, 2017 is expected to see a 7% decline in installations from 74   GW to 69 GW. This would be a significant downturn after years of   growth, but it's not all that surprising to industry observers.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) , and even shares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) in SolarCity were all hammered by this decline   before the calendar turned to 2017.While this year may be bad for solar energy, it may be the   calm before a wave of installations hits starting in 2018. And if   you look out on the horizon the solar future looks to be getting   brighter everyday.makeArticleAd();Solar installations like this one have become more and more     common around the world in the past decade. Image source: Getty     Images.A series of unfortunate eventsThe decline in installations in 2017 will be driven by a   number of negative events all hitting at once. There was an   urgency that drove a boom in installations in 2016 when the   investment tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. was set to expire, but   the extension in late 2015 took away any urgency for utilities to   sign solar contracts for 2017. Long-term, the extension will lead   to more solar installations, but not until the 2018-2021   timeframe.China will also be a drag after installing a record 34.2 GW of   solar (enough to power 5.6 million U.S. homes) in 2016 according   to the Chinese National Energy Administration. No one quite knows   how much solar will be installed in China in 2017, but the NEA   only plans to average 27.5 GW of installations over the next four   years so it's safe to say installations will be down.Japan is another country where the solar industry is in for a   rough year. According to GTM Research, an estimated 10.2 GW of   solar was installed in Japan in 2016, but that will drop to 8.8   GW in 2017 as feed-in tariff reductions hit. Japan is a high   potential solar market, but public policy hasn't kept up with   potential and that will keep a cap on growth short-term.Why growth is on the horizonWhile these factors in the U.S., China, and Japan will drive a   decline in solar installations in 2017, that doesn't mean the   industry is heading into a dark chapter. Solar energy has never   been cheaper and bids for new power plants are coming in under 4   cents per kWh in some locations, a price that would beat any new   fossil fuel or nuclear plant on a cost basis.Image source: SunPower.Emerging markets like Chile, Mexico, Argentina, India, and the   Middle East are starting to see the potential of solar as well.   Mexico's recent auction resulted in clean energy contracts with   an average price of 3.3 cents per kWh and given the low cost many   countries are following with their own reverse auctions in 2017.   Nearly four dozen countries could have energy auctions this year   and that would lead to a boom in demand in 2018 and beyond.Solar energy is cost effective today, but energy projects have   this lag between when people decide to go solar and when projects   are in the ground. That's the lull the market is in today.   Leading developers like First Solar, SunPower, and Canadian Solar   could will their backlog in 2018 and 2019, despite having a down   year in 2017.Solar energy is still the future of energyOver the past decade alone, solar energy has grown from a 2 GW   industry that could install enough power generation to power   368,000 homes per year to an industry giant that installed 74 GW,   or enough to power 12.1 million homes, in the last year alone.   And growth was driven by a whopping 90% drop in solar panel costs   as technology improves across the industry.2017 may be a down year for the solar industry for a variety   of reasons, but it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that   solar energy is the most abundant energy source in the world and   the cost to generate solar power is now lower than fossil fuels   in most of the world.Like it or not, the solar boom is really just beginning and   2017 will be a calm before what could be another 16 years of   consecutive growth for solar energy.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

How was the train?Muckerman:Busier than normal. Rush hour.O'Reilly:Do you have an open coming up? What's up?Muckerman:No, just, all-team meeting for the international side. We   got folks in Australia and the U.K. that we have to consider   in the time frames, also Singapore. So you can't do it at   noon.O'Reilly:Oh, man. Do you Skype them in?Muckerman:Yeah. If Skype works.O'Reilly:That's the eternal question.Muckerman:We go through the rotation of Skype, Slack, Google Hangouts   -- they all fry on different days.O'Reilly:Can you believe thatMicrosoftpaid $8 billion for Skype? Think about that.Muckerman:I cannot. They could have paid me $8 billion and I'd done   the same thing.O'Reilly:Eight followed by nine zeros, and it's not the best   program.Muckerman:It's not.O'Reilly:Anyway. Should we talk about energy and stuff, or ... ?Muckerman:That's what you had planned, right?O'Reilly:Yeah, well, you're the man with the plan. So, Mr.   Muckerman, according to a new report from the Environmental   Defense Fund's Climate Corps Program --Muckerman:Say that one more time?O'Reilly:Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Corps Programs. Say that   five times fast.Muckerman:No, that's all you.O'Reilly:Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Corps Program. Environmental   Defense Fund's Climate --Muckerman:All right, what did they have to say?O'Reilly:It was actually kind of cool. The solar and wind industries   are apparently creating jobs at a rate of 12 times   faster than the rest of the U.S. economy. That's actually   kind of significant. It's not even off a small base. This is   millions of jobs.Muckerman:Yeah. It's up to, roughly, about 4.5 million jobs in the U.S.,   from 3.5 in 2011.O'Reilly:Yeah. And we have a population of 320   million, about a little over 100 million in the workforce   this year. This is not small potatoes anymore.Muckerman:Yeah, and if it continues growing near the 20% that it   has been in recent years, we're going to see some very   meaningful growth. These numbers are going to continue to   grow.O'Reilly:I have to learn how to install solar panels.Muckerman:Something like that.O'Reilly:But for this reason, this growth that we're seeing, I   naturally started to wonder where, this renewable-energy   project, where is this usage common? You hear stories about   how Las Vegas is all renewable now, Hawaii, you go to   Hawaii and apparently solar is everywhere. So I started to   wonder, where is this more common than not? Because here in   Virginia, we have a lot of natural gas-fired plants, some   from Ohio; I'm sure there's a coal fire plant there   somewhere still --Muckerman:Not a new one. Only about 0.17% of all new electric   generating capacity last year came from coal.O'Reilly:Is that, like, a guy burning coal in his shed out back?Muckerman:I think that's what that amounts to. 0.17%. Yeah.   Only 45 megawatts.O'Reilly:Wow. Anyway. We dove in and looked around the world and saw   where it was pretty common, and we found a few surprises, and a   few other places that we're not so surprising. What do you   think -- should we start with the U.S. and then the world, or   vice versa?Muckerman:America first!O'Reilly:America first, all right, perfect. Let's break it down.   What's going on in America?Muckerman:You're seeing it crop up everywhere -- that's   renewable, not just solar. When you look at all new energy   capacity added last year in 2016, we're looking   at about 26 gigawatts were added, and 61.5% came from   biomass, waste, heat, solar, wind, or hydro. Nearly   two-thirds. Another third came from natural gas, which, on   the fossil-fuel side, is the cleanest of the three, meaning   oil, coal, or natural gas. So, arguably, what was that,   94.5% is generally clean, almost two-thirds is renewable. That's   a pretty big move.O'Reilly:I have to ask, because a lot of companies are starting to invest   in this. You have the yieldcos, like8point3 Energy Partners; you haveSunEdison [Yieldco's TerraForm Power and TerraForm   Global].Muckerman:MidAmerican Energyhas one of the largest wind projects in   Iowa, generating 301 megawatts.O'Reilly:Owned by Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) .Muckerman:Name drop.O'Reilly:I had to.Muckerman:It's fine. He's in it. They're in it.O'Reilly:Did you see that special, by the way?Muckerman:I did not, but it has been talked about here at The Fool. What   was it, PBS? HBO?O'Reilly:It was HBO. It's mostly about his personal life.Muckerman:OK. Just a lot of Diet Coke or actual Coke?O'Reilly:And breakfast atMcDonald'severy day.Muckerman:Perfect. Living to be 100.O'Reilly:We are not being compensated by HBO at all, to   our listeners. We're talking about HBO'sBecoming Warren Buffett, it aired on the 30th.Muckerman:Oh, you didn't get a free subscription?O'Reilly:No. I'm going to watch it this weekend. Actually, I probably   will sign up for the free trial. Anyway, bottom line, I   actually knew this stuff had a future when Buffett started   investing in windmills. I was like, ""Oh, this is actually   economical,"" because he does not do things that are not   going to make him money. We saw that one statistic about Alaska.   What's up with those guys?Muckerman:When you think Alaska, you think oil, generally. They have a lot   of it; they're producing a lot of it. And kodiaks, and stuff   like that. But this is a state that, they basically give a   paycheck to all their citizens from all the oil revenues   that they make on an annual basis. And what they're seeing is,   solar and wind is actually cheaper in a lot of places than   oil and diesel, because you're looking at some   places, the more remote areas of Alaska, they needed to   use diesel, of all things, to generate electricity. We're   looking at upwards of $0.60 per kilowatt-hour. Meanwhile,   you're looking at some people that are   generating energy from hydro and wind in the city of   Kodiak, and you're looking at about $0.11 per hour. So a   sixth of what they're paying on the diesel side.   And that seems to be a theme. Texas, one of the   fastest-growing renewable energy-generating states in the   country, traditionally all oil and natural gas when you   think about it. Right on par with California,   which produces its own share of natural gas, but not   nearly what Texas is doing. So Alaska, Texas, seeing   that renewable energy is finally at parity or below parity   with fossil fuel electricity generation.O'Reilly:So, what am I to take away from this? Are people just   invested in this because they're like, ""Oh, we need more   electricity, so we're just going to invest in this because   of regulations""? Or is this actually being done in the   places where is economical, and that's it? How are businesses   making decisions here?Muckerman:Well, it's becoming economical in more places every   day. Even if you think, Donald Trump appointed all these   folks that are closely tied to the fossil-fuel   industry, but on his list of infrastructure   projects, he has a lot on there that supports the   renewable-energy industry --O'Reilly:You're kidding, what?Muckerman:Projects like, a lot of transmission lines so that you can   build the infrastructure for these companies, so that they   can actually get the power from a wind plant. He has this Plains   & Eastern electric transmission line project, which is   trying to move wind energy from the western tip of   Oklahoma 720 miles south to --O'Reilly:That sounds like the Pickens Plan, remember that?Muckerman:-- southeast to Memphis. And that's enough clean energy for   1 million homes in the Mid-South. So that's just one area.   That's not actually building the wind turbines, but it's   allowing that power to be efficiently distributed to places.   Obviously, if you think about Memphis' population   compared to the plains of Western Oklahoma, it's a little   bit more densely populated. So right now, those wind   turbines probably aren't being used to the   efficiency and the efficacy that they should be. But then,   you have hydroelectric plants planned, more transmission lines,   wind power, energy storage and grid   modernization targeting minimizing the magnitude of   potential blackouts in California by increasing storage for   renewable energy. All told, it says that the projects could   add about 9 gigawatts of clean power if they are all   finalized and put into place. So that's roughly about a   third of all the energy capacity that we have added in the last   year, just in a few of these projects that Trump has laid   out in his initial infrastructure plan.O'Reilly:Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I just mentioned, that   sounds a lot like the Pickens Plan. Do you remember that, in   2008, T. Boone Pickens was like, ""You have this energy   corridor from The Dakotas down to Oklahoma, you have all   this wind, you need to get it to the coast,"" and he wanted   to build these huge transmission lines? And one of the   problems is they need to be enormous, because if you're   sending electricity over long distances, you lose some of it.   It's actually very difficult. That's kind of exciting.Muckerman:Yeah. A lot of these projects are being built by private   companies, so it's very fragmented, almost on a   state-by-state basis. If you go to the SEIA website, the Solar   Energy Industry Association, they put out a report from   September 2016 that basically lists every project that's   online, being constructed, or in development in the   entire United States. The list is 30-40 pages long, because   there are just so many small companies that are out there   building one plant, two plants. Maybe eventually they will get   bought up, or maybe some of those are part of a bigger   holding corp. But it's very widely distributed. It's not   all public companies that are doing this. Generally, if you   think about the suppliers of these wind turbines and solar   panels, those are --O'Reilly:Like aGeneral Electricor something.Muckerman:Yeah, those are coming from publicly traded companies like a   General Electric, like aSiemens. Then on the solar-panel side you haveFirst SolarandSunPower, and thenSolarCityon the residential side. They're actually providing the   solar panels and doing some installation. But a lot of the   folks that are building these and operating them are private   companies, for now.O'Reilly:Awesome. So, Mr. Muckerman, it sounds like in the   United States, solar is becoming common.Muckerman:Adding jobs, adding clean energy, being supported by states   that you might not think would support clean energy, and   even Donald Trump is supporting it.O'Reilly:And it's because of economics.Muckerman:Yes. Flat-out.O'Reilly:So, solar is going in where there is sun; wind is going   where there's wind. It's cost effective.Muckerman:Yeah. I'm pretty sure they even just approved the   largest offshore wind farm in U.S. history off Long Island.   So, there's that.O'Reilly:For New York City, yeah.Muckerman:Yeah. If you look at the Northeast, they're pretty   underserved. At least, natural gas energy hits New York   and doesn't make it past New York. So the New England area   is definitely hurting for natural gas and renewable energy.O'Reilly:It was a big learning experience for me when I saw   both how needed and difficult it is to get natural gas   lines up there in the Northeast. It's like a web, and   there's not enough. It's kind of crazy.Muckerman:They're trying to build them, but not quickly.O'Reilly:It's densely populated; it's actually kind of difficult.   Really quick, before we talk about some more specifics,   like in a continent like Africa with the sunlight it   gets and everything and how, with solar, you can put up a   solar panel and power something, it's decentralized. That   will obviously see some growth, and we'll discuss that in a   minute. But I wanted to quickly go down a list. This is   enormous. There's a group called The Renewable Energy Policy   Network for the 21st Century. They, every year, put out of a   report on the global status report of renewable energy. You   can go to ren21.net and check it out. They do this every   June, so we have last June's report, and it mostly   covers 2015. But anecdotally, this sort of thing doesn't get   changed a lot. This thing is pages and pages long! All   right, let's do a quiz. Where do you think --Muckerman:Oh, I have the list right in front of me.O'Reilly:Oh, you do?Muckerman:Yeah. I can't cheat on air.O'Reilly:Shut your computer!Muckerman:I've seen it; it's too late.O'Reilly:All right, fine.Muckerman:We can quiz our listeners. Give them five seconds to guess.O'Reilly:All right, our listeners can check this out. Google   ""2016 report.""Muckerman:Sorry. I ruined it. You sent it to me.O'Reilly:I'm not going to forget this. No, I did. What stuck out to you   there? You have China beating us for investment in renewable   fuels --Muckerman:And total capacity or generation as of the end of   2015 for all renewable power. That's only set to   accelerate, I think, you're looking at China expected   to, according to Reuters, plow $361 billion into   renewable-energy power generation by 2020 -- $361 billion. That   will create 13 million jobs, they estimate. And that's just   over a five-year period from 2016 to 2020.O'Reilly:The per-capita numbers were hilarious to me. Investment in   renewable power and fuel per unit of GDP, No. 1 was   Mauritania, then Honduras, Uruguay, Morocco, and   Jamaica. Renewable power capacity per capita, No. 1 is of course   Denmark, Germany, Sweden. But, dollar for   dollar, it's pretty much us, China, Germany, a little   Japan and the U.K. in there.Muckerman:Yeah, Japan is No. 3 in terms of investment in 2015. Then   the U.K., and then India.O'Reilly:Which is not surprising, because they had the nuclear   problem, they have no natural resources, they don't   have oil, so it's like, what are we going to do here?Muckerman:Makes total sense, and they're surrounded by ocean.O'Reilly:A little tricky there. I was surprised by how big biomass   energy is. Is that the landfills, and it has methane burning   it --Muckerman:Yeah, the waste, heat, things like that.O'Reilly:I was surprised by how big that was.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. A decent amount. If you think   about how much we actually do waste, it's smart to use   it.O'Reilly:Yeah. It's physics. This is just energy; it's like wind.   These things happen.Muckerman:Energy can never be created or destroyed.O'Reilly:Oh, man. That's very Zen of you.Muckerman:Isn't that something that they say in physics?O'Reilly:Yeah. All right, let's dive in here to a few   unique interesting situations. Saudi Arabia.   They obviously have a ton of sunlight, but ...Muckerman:What are they well known for, besides sunlight?O'Reilly:Oh, I don't know, maybe they're known for going out   into the desert and sticking a straw in the sand and getting   oil.Muckerman:And they are expected to dump between $30 [billion] and $50   billion into major renewable energy by 2023. So not nearly on the   same level as China, but still.O'Reilly: Well, what was the Saudi Aramco, the oil   company that might be IPO-ing in a year or two,   they're talking about dabbling in it a little bit, I   saw this morning.Muckerman:Maybe $5 billion in renewable-energy deals, yeah. They've askedHSBC, [JPMorgan Chase], andCredit Suisseto go out there and try to find some companies that they   might be able to buy with $5 billion of cash lying around.O'Reilly:What do you think Saudi Arabia is thinking? I see a   couple possibilities, or maybe it's all of them. Is   this, we need to shift away from oil because someday   we're not going to be able to use it?Muckerman:Yeah, I think the last couple years was a gut check for   them, because oil provides a pretty decent amount of   subsidies for the social programs they have. So they've been   losing out on a lot of that revenue. So they're trying to at   least internally reduce their demand on oil.O'Reilly:So they can sell more oil?Muckerman:Yeah, I think that probably has something to do with   it. Also, they powered their country with oil.O'Reilly:I was about to say, they are one of the few countries that burns   oil for their electricity grid.Muckerman:Yeah. So if they can make electricity cheaper, then why not?   They're looking to grow up to about to about 30% of their   power from low-carbon sources by 2030. Right now, they   have about 10 gigawatts of power from wind, solar, and   nuclear.O'Reilly:Sweet. I have to think they're trying to play catch-up with   the UAE, too. They've been doing a lot with solar.Muckerman:I mean, they're right there' it's the desert; they have   plenty of sun right along the equator.O'Reilly:Yeah, exactly. What else stuck out to you as you looked   around the globe? As I mentioned, I'm optimistic about   Africa because installing the transmission lines   for traditional centralized power like we have, like   a natural gas-burning power plant or something, it's a   little bit of a hassle.Muckerman:Well, if you think about it in terms of what they have   done with telephones, for example. They've pretty much   skipped land lines and went right to cellphones. So if you think   about it, it's a similar situation. You have a cell-phone   tower rather than telephone lines crisscrossing the   country. You can liken a cellphone tower to a solar   grid, because they can be placed sporadically around the   country and distributed in the regions where they're needed.   So I think that's probably what's going to happen. It's just   going to skip traditional power generation and go straight to   renewable, more regional distribution, as needed.O'Reilly:It almost seems like renewables are the best thing that ever   happened for developing nations. I mean, that's pretty   darn useful.Muckerman:Now that it's cost-effective, yeah. Beforehand, they were   just kind of waiting on it. Companies want to invest. Foreign   direct investment is a big thing in this world. I don't   know if it's going to be African companies that are building   these solar and wind and hydroelectric power   plants, but somebody is going to do it because there's money   to be made.O'Reilly:Right. So I'm an investor, you're an investor, we're all Fools,   we're all investors. How do you get in on this? What do you   see as the reasonable way to make money off these   trends?Muckerman:For me, personally, I would probably look at the bigger   providers of the equipment. Like we mentioned, a few,   GE kind of hedges your bets a little bit, because   they're involved in oil and gas, and also, they   have exposure to renewable-energy sources. So I think that   kind of hedges your bets a little bit.O'Reilly:The hardware is like, eh, what do you think about an advanced   solar-panel manufacturer, like aCanadian Solaror something?Muckerman:They have had their troubles.O'Reilly:If you can't see him, he's wincing right now.Muckerman:That's just because these companies have gone in waves. One   company makes an advancement, and everyone jumps on   their bandwagon, and then somebody else's solar-panel   cells become more efficient, so everybody jumps ship   and starts using them.O'Reilly:It's like computers.Muckerman:Yeah. So that's why I would say big holding company like GE   or Siemens to get access to wind power. Then, companies that   are effectively adding solar power at utility scale. I think   that's really where you're going to make your money. So   MidAmerican might be a good choice, or SunPower, which is a more   global company. You see SunPower installing solar panels,   and First Solar, too, all over the world. SunPower is fortunate   enough to have the backing ofTotal, which is a forward-thinking oil and gas company.O'Reilly:Right. What do they own, 30% of that thing?Muckerman:It might be more, it's at least 30%. They may have upped   their stake in the past couple years. I'm not 100% sure.O'Reilly:That wouldn't surprise me.Muckerman:Then there's another company that's hedging its bets   between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy --   Total, a French company. There's just a few to point out.   Bu, like I said earlier, a lot of these companies are   private. You have to do some digging, but maybe you could   hold a portfolio of a few of these companies, little bits   and pieces of each, rather than betting your entire   portfolio of renewable energy on one or two companies. You can,   maybe, buy a basket of them.O'Reilly:Awesome. Yeah, the bottom line, it sounds like, is that this   trend is happening. It is becoming increasingly common in   more and more places.Muckerman:Yeah, it sure is. You think aboutTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)and SolarCity being combined with some help   from Panasonic and that lithium-battery factory. If   energy storage does happen, which, I think it would have to   from renewable-energy sources, the Tesla Gigafactory out   there in California is looking to build more batteries than   the entire capacity to build batteries worldwide is right now. So   they're expecting the need to be there.O'Reilly:Awesome.Muckerman:If you don't have renewable-energy generation, you don't need   those batteries. So they'd better pray that the trend continues,   which I expect it to.O'Reilly:Awesome. All right. Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman.Muckerman:Well, what are you looking at? Let's get some thoughts from   you really quick before we head out. You mentioned one company?   8point3?O'Reilly:Yeah. We're short on time. Thank you for the shout-out, though.   I'm kind of conservative with this sort of thing. One, I'm   not a tech person. I don't know which solar panel is the best,   that sort of thing. But I like the monopolistic   characteristics, the cash generation characteristics of   those yieldcos that get spun out, and they just build huge solar   projects. They send the electricity into the grid. That's   it. 8point3 Energy Partners has a 7% yield, it's kind of   guaranteed. I mean, it's meat and potatoes.Muckerman:Unless the sun starts charging for its rays, then   these companies are sitting kind of pretty in the long   run.O'Reilly:Right. Cool. All right. That is it for us, folks.   Special thanks for our producer, Austin Morgan. Thanks for   laughing at all of our bad jokes, Austin!

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.makeArticleAd();The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the future of software.If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and itsearnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps withautonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch andAudi.All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.All thanks to Nvidia."

2 Brilliant Ways NVIDIA Corporation Is Investing in the Future;2/9/2017;"Investors followingNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) already know that the company is a clear leader in   the graphics processing unit (GPU) space as it holds more than   70% of the discrete desktop GPU market share right now.NVIDIA earns about 62% of its total revenue from sales of GPUs   in its gaming segment, but the company isn't satisfied with just   kicking up its feet and reaping the benefits of that. Instead,   NVIDIA is using its GPU knowledge to begin dominating two future   markets: self-driving technology and data centers.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Hitting the gas on self-driving technologyIt's hard to write about NVIDIA's future without talking about   semi-autonmous driving. That's because autos are a clear area of   focus for the company and because NVIDIA has already taken an   early lead.NVIDIA uses its GPUs to process images from on-board cameras   mounted on semi-autonomous cars so that the vehicles know what   they're looking at (i.e., a moving car vs. a dumpster). NVIDIA's   supercomputer, called Drive PX 2, is on its second iteration   already and is used by more than 80 automakers and Tier 1   automotive suppliers to deliver high levels of semi-autonomous   features.Teslais the latest carmaker to begin using NVIDIA's technologies for   self-driving capabilities, and there are plenty of reasons   investors should be optimistic that NVIDIA's current automotive   investments are just getting started.The company earned $127 million from its automotive segment in   fiscal Q3 2017, which was a 60% increase year over year. While   that figure isn't a lot of money for the company -- it represents   just over 6% of NVIDIA's top line in the quarter -- it's worth   mentioning that the overall driverless car market is expected to   be worth $77 billion by 2035.Tesla's commitment to its ongoing release of new   semi-autonomous driving tech, Google'snewly created Waymoself-driving car company, andBaidu's aggressive self-driving technology tests in China all point to   a coming future of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles.IHSAutomotive predicts that the world could reach driverless car   ubiquity about 30 years from now -- and NVIDIA is creating some   of the technology right now to make that a reality.Data centers risingAside from automotive tech, the other area NVIDIA is investing   its future in is data centers. This segment has been part of the   company's business for a while, but recently, NVIDIA has doubled   its efforts to expand into new data center markets -- and it's   paying off enormously.In fiscal Q3 2017, the company earned $240 million from its   data center segment, a staggering increase of 192% year over   year. When asked about the company's data center growth, CEO   Jen-Hsun Huang said NVIDIA has been creating new   opportunities in the space like virtualization, deep   learning, and computational science.Data center revenue accounted for about 12% of the company's   top line in the third quarter, but investors should keep in mind   that this segment is the company's fastest-growing business, and   it has some of the highest margins as well. NVIDIA believes its   data center addressable market is worth $5 billion, making it a   massive revenue opportunity for the company's future.Just the beginningNVIDIA had a tremendous 2016, with the company's stock price   skyrocketing 229%, and that's left investors understandably   wondering if there's more where that came from. We'll know a bit   more when the company releases its fourth-quarter 2017 results   later this week, but no matter what happens, investors should   look to NVIDIA's long-term pursuits outside of its core gaming   segment. NVIDIA's focus on automotive technologies and data   centers could be two huge growth areas in the coming years -- and   they're future opportunities investors shouldn't overlook.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why You Should (and Shouldn't) Buy NVIDIA;2/9/2017;"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , the graphics-chip maker and leader in the   burgeoning virtual-reality and driverless-car markets, has been   on an absolute tear over the past 12 months, with shares up over   340%. At this point, it's natural for investors to wonder if it's   too late to buy a few shares -- this run could just be the   start of NVIDIA's path to world domination, or it could be the   very top of a bubble-like valuation.While the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle, there   are certain types of investors who should, and shouldn't, invest   in NVIDIA no matter what the reality is. So with this fundamental   truth in mind, we asked two of The Motley Fool's best and   brightest just who should (and shouldn't) invest in NVIDIA.   Here's what they had to say.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.You firmly believe in the growth storyChris Neiger: NVIDIA has caught the eye of many tech investors with its stock   price run-up in 2016. The investor optimism is more than just   speculation, though. NVIDIA is already a dominant force in the   GPU market, with more than 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market   share, and it shows no signs of ceding its lead to rivalAMD. That's important, because the company brings in about 62% of   its total revenue from its gaming GPU segment.If that were the only thing going for NVIDIA, it would   probably be enough. But one of the reasons this company is so   exciting is that it's taking what it knows about GPUs and   applying it to all-new growth markets -- namely, semi-autonomous   driving and high-powered, artificially intelligent   supercomputers. The company's DGX-1 computer uses deep learning   and artificial-intelligence analytics to generate as much   processing power as 250 conventional servers. Data-center revenue   is NVIDIA's second-largest business segment, and the company is   proving it can innovate like no other in the space.In the semi-autonomous-driving market, NVIDIA's Drive PX 2   supercomputer is being used as the onboard computer for many   self-driving vehicles. The computer uses NVIDIA's GPUs to   processes visual information in real time and give cars a type of   situational awareness. Eighty automakers and Tier 1 automotive   suppliers are already using NVIDIA's Drive PX system, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just became one of NVIDA's most recent customers.   Some investors may be scared away by the company's pricey P/E   ratio of 74, but NVIDIA should continue to be a long-term growth   story as long as the company continues growing gaming revenue at   a healthy clip and its investments in AI and semi-autonomous   driving continue to pay off.Because everyone else isSean O'Reilly: NVIDIA remains the undisputed king of advanced graphics chips.   What's more, thanks to its NVIDIA Drive PX 2 computing   platform, it has a respectable stake in the future of   driverless carsandartificial intelligence. Given these catalysts, it's shouldn't   have been surprising that NVIDIA was one of the best performing   stocks of 2017. Yet that awe-inspiring performance is precisely   where the danger in investing in the company now lies.To invest in any company, not just NVIDIA, you need to believe   in that company and perform your due diligence. You need to read   conference calls, have faith in management's vision for the   future, and find the current valuation compelling, because at   some point, your faith in the company will be tested. It's not   unheard of for a stock that's rewarded shareholders with huge   gains in a short period to fall, 10%, 20%, or even 30%, only to   then rocket ever higher -- leaving those who sold in the pullback   out in the cold.NVIDIA has a fantastic suite of offerings, led by its GeForce,   PureVideo, nForce, GoForce, and Quadro chips, and a foothold   in a number of potentially huge markets. NVIDIA is exceptional at   what it does -- but they are not unassailable (yet) and it's   worth repeating that those big catalysts arepotentiallyhuge markets. Right now, the company is a non-monopolistic   business, playing in nascent tech segments, and it's priced at 40   times forward FY 2017 earnings. Even further out, the company   currently trades at 23 times FY 2020 estimates earnings, as   estimated byS&P Global Market Intelligence. If NVIDIA stumbles with quarterly results or offers up guidance   that implies the business will slow down, the stock price will   more than likely take a hit as expectations of future profits   normalize.Bottom line: Don't just buy into NVIDIA because it's the   current hot stock. Investors interested in the business need to   have the stomach for growth investing. You will be tested, and   the last thing you want to do with a great business like NVIDIA   is to sell out when Mr. Market throws a fit.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

How Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Benefits From Tillerson’s Appointment;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPolitical pundits were generally aghast when President Donald J. Trump appointed then-CEO ofExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), Rex Tillerson, to the post of Secretary of State. The prevailing wisdom that somehow this position had to be filled by someone from government, with political experience, was blown to bits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWelcome to the Trump administration, which is defining itself by blowing up the way things are ""normally done.""Since that announcement, other news have altered my theory regarding why Tillerson was named, but only cosmetically, and I believe it is very good news for XOM shareholders over the long term.Few people had likely heard of the joint venture between XOM and Russia's state-owned oil exploration and production operation,Rosneft(OTCMKTS:RNFTF). Exxon created astrategic agreementto ""establish the framework for joint oil exploration and production in Russia, the United States, and other countries,"" according to Exxon. Ten joint ventures for projects in the Russian Arctic, Black Sea and Siberia have since been set up.Of course, pushing this forward became difficult because the U.S. placed sanctions on Russia.My expectation had been that Trump would lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for some kind of agreement to partner on attacking Isis, or some cosmetic withdrawal from Crimea or Ukraine. Then, Exxon could get back to work with Rosneft. Who better to negotiate this deal with Putin that the most recent CEO of Exxon Mobil?In a shocking coincidence (yes, that's sarcasm), Putin suddenlyannouncedthat it had sold 19.5% stake in Rosneft to a mysterious Singapore investment group, allegedly a 50-50 JV between Swiss and Qatari oil firms. Yet, nobody seems to know who funded about 25% of the purchase, and why some portion of the ownership is a Cayman Islands company belonging to an unidentified owner.My working theory is that Trump is all about deals. Say what you will about Putin, but at the end of the day, politics is about deals. Putin will make deals. Not only is Tillerson a deal-maker, but he knows politics. He's been all over the world, traversing all kinds of political landscapes to make deals for his global oil company! Duh!12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenAll of these moving parts are, I believe, geared toward moving the XOM-Rosneft projects forward. I'm going to guess that something about the Russian sanctions may not apply if Russia owns less than a certain amount.After this sale, the Russian state owns about 55%. Interestingly,BP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) also ownsa 20% stakein Rosneft. About 5% is publicly traded. If Russian state ownership falls under 50%, and we see Rosneft's projects start up, we'll have our answer.I'm also willing to bet that the mysterious buyers of this recent sale are ultimately tied directly to the Russian state or Putin himself. It just looks like it isn't.Now, what does this mean for Exxon Mobil stock? It's all good. The Russian Arctic is expected to hold tons of oil, not to mention the other areas of the joint venture. One has to assume that XOM stock is going to benefit because Exxon has already deployed assets and human capital over there. It may not exactly be a matter of flipping a switch, but the projects are much farther along than trying to hunt and contract for new areas to explore.Nor does XOM have to get involved with the bad PR that would result from wanting to drill in protected areas here in the U.S.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3Thus, XOM is in the catbird seat. Russia wants the oil, also, so both countries can be less dependent on oil from the Middle East. That could also mean the countries will partner on trying to eradicate Radical Islamic terrorism. That's never a bad thing.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned.

Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 Looks Like It's Still on Track for 2017 Production;2/9/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 production is still slated to begin   ""later this year as planned,"" the company confirmed in a   statement to the press this week. Furthermore, it said it's still   aiming to ramp up ""toward 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018.""   With Tesla's planned Model 3 launch not too far away, and with   2018 being just 10 months out, the update's timing may help ease   some concerns about Tesla's ability to stick to its ambitious   production ramp-up schedule.Tesla's car factory in Fremont, California. Image source:     author.makeArticleAd();Pausing production for upgradesTesla's update on production comes as the company plans to   pause production of its Model S and X so it can install some   updates ahead of Model 3 production, the electric-car maker   explained in its statement.Tesla will begin a brief, planned pause in production for a     week in February to prepare for Model 3 production. During this     time, we plan to add capacity to the existing paint shop so     that it is ready for Model 3, and perform general maintenance     on other factory equipment.Importantly, Tesla said it doesn't expect this to negatively   impact its planned first-quarter deliveries.We do not anticipate this brief pause to have a material     impact on our Q1 production or delivery figures, as we have     added production days to compensate.Tesla won't be starting from scratch on the tooling for its   Model 3 paint shop. The automaker said in its second-quarter   update last year that it already had some Model 3 production   equipment on the line, ""including initial capacity in our   stamping and paint centers.""Reuters: Tesla to test-build some Model 3 units this     monthShortly after news surfaced of Tesla's plans to pause   production this month to update its production and paint   capabilities, Reuterssaidon Wednesday afternoon that Tesla is planning ""to begin   test-building its Model 3 sedans on Feb. 20, according to people   familiar with the matter.""Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.The timing of some Model 3 units is about in line with what   investors should expect, given the company's internal target for   suppliers for a production start date in July.While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is aiming to   start Model 3 production in July, investors should realize this   specific date is only an internal target, appropriately ambitious   so that Tesla can live up to its promise to begin volume   production at some point in the second half of 2017. Musk   explained this internal deadline in Tesla's second-quarter   earnings call last year (via a Reuterstranscript):I don't expect us to be at full production on July 1. But I     have to drive all suppliers and internal efforts to that date,     knowing that some will fall short. And those that fall short     will be cut out of the picture.And if there are teams internally that fail to execute     effectively, we will reorganize those teams. But if several     thousand parts are not driven to a particular date, there is no     chance of making any point even past that date. In an ideal     world, this would be a confidential internal, July 1 would be a     confidential internal target.Given the amount of attention that Tesla receives and the     fact that there are several, if you count two or three, three     and four suppliers, there's several thousand companies     involved. It is obviously impossible to keep that confidential.     You can't.So then in order to have a consistent message, internally     knowing that that message will also reach externally, that's     where the July 1 date comes from.All Tesla has promised for Model 3's launch, production, and   deliveries in 2017 is what the company said in its third-quarter   shareholder letter: ""Gigafactory construction and Model 3   development both remain on plan to support volume Model 3   production and deliveries in the second half of 2017."" And as   Tesla pauses production for some Model 3 factory upgrades and   reportedly plans to produce some Model 3 units, which will   presumably serve as beta test versions, the company appears to be   making appropriate progress ahead of its Model 3 launch.When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb.   22,  investors will likely get a more detailed update on   where the company stands with Model 3, as management will likely   provide a glimpse into its full-year expectations.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Ride the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) Higher With This Trade;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThus far 2017 has been rough for energy stocks. They stumbled right out of the gate and have been trying to find their footing ever since. TheEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE) is now down 3.7% year-to-date, making it the worst performing sector by far.makeArticleAd();But XLE bulls shouldn't give up hope. Support looms large and the time for a rebound is nigh. Yesterday's sharp intraday reversal is catching the eye of chart watchers everywhere. The early morning descent was stopped dead in its tracks.By day's end, XLE carved out a sweet bullish hammer candle on heavy volume. Couple that with the oversold conditions for the sector and we can finally make the case for a bullish play.Of course, the strength out of the stock market at-large certainly isn't hurting either. It's unlikely that energy stocks will continue plumbing the depths if the broader market remains strong.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixThe 200-day moving average is coming in hot for XLE and is as logical a level as any for buyers to finally make a stand.Additionally, we just filled the significant gap from last November. And as any technician knows, gaps, once filled, often become support zones.How to Buy the Energy Stock DipWhile we could certainly go for the gusto by purchasing call options on energy stocks, let's instead create a higher probability play with a bull put spread.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenIf you think XLE remains above $69 for the next month, sell the March $69/$65 bull put spread for 53 cents.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year results to the investment community after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I've been slow to warm to Nvidia's investment appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock has nearly tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe key to the forthcoming earnings release will be growth - just like it is for any company. So far, the earnings momentum and increases in analyst projections suggest Nvidia's prospects are bright.But will NVDA stock holders have to tolerate some bumps along the way?Nvidia Earnings ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in early December, I suggested keeping an eye on earnings trends. At that time, full-year earnings estimates (the average of the earnings all analysts covering the name expect the company to report) had jumped nearly 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It's a key reason NVDA stock has rallied so strongly.The current full-year estimate for Nvidia earnings (according to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relays that 19 analysts have provided estimates. That's about flat over the past 60 days, but actually down slightly from the $2.45 projected 30 days ago.But really, this is splitting hairs. It's very likely NVDA reports a solid quarter in terms of bottom-line growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAnd sales growth is projected to bestellar. Analysts expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-line growth is projected to slow to 16% for full-year sales of nearly $8 billion; 2018 profits are currently pegged at $2.71 per share.The Business Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock sits right below 50. That's a rather lofty multiple, and it essentially means that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickly surging share price could take a similarly speedy tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia operates in some of the most exciting growth areas for semiconductors. The company is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular its graphic processing units, or GPUs. The company boasts it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. This looks accurate - a recentBarron'sarticlepegged its GPU market share at 68%. This is one of the most compelling spaces in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia's chips are an integral component in the ecosystems that are pioneering growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machine learning, and self-driving cars. These are some hugely disruptive industries that could end up revolutionizing many facets of the gaming, computing, and automotive industries.The company's gaming business is the largest operating unit and growing 30% per year on average since 2013. Its data center business (to support cloud computing) is expanding at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automotive is skyrocketing 75% annually, though from a very small initial base.In some respects, and provided you are comfortable with the lofty valuation, Nvidia is a very compelling way for broad exposure to multiple disruptive industries.NVDA adds exposure to the cloud-computing excitement that is creating a buzz at giant tech firms includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole position in the autonomous automobile charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 computing platform currently powers the Tesla auto models that already have self-driving capabilities.The CompetitionMore direct competitors includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are looking to grow in these newer markets. Both key rivals are also likely to benefit from GPUs used to power gaming systems, machine learning, and servers used for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from its dominant market share in personal computing. Its 80% market share to power personal computers and related devices has literally resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in cash flow over the past several decades. This gives it unmatched rivalry to invest in new technology and keep a leadership position over chip competitors. But computing is mature and barely expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost its way. Years of mismanagement allowed Intel to expand on its dominance and nearly put AMD out of business. But new management appears to have reinvigorated AMD, and investors are starting to believe it can also benefit from the same markets Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arecent interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni pegged semiconductor stocks as one of his favorite industries for 2017. In his words, ""we're talking about major secular disruptions in autos, consumer electronics, and gaming."" Chips that power data warehouses to serve the rise in cloud computing represent yet another market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor's best bet to gain exposure to these markets. The rub, of course, is its valuation already reflects many more years of rapid growth.AMD is an interesting turnaround play, though with its current low levels of profitability, the trading multiples are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. Its forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest taking a wait-and-see approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is likely to impress, but given the lofty valuation, any hiccup in the expectations could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEveryone knows thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking to leverage the 10th anniversary of the iPhone to boost sales. The smartphone market is maturing, and last quarter's record iPhone numbers were the first positive news in a while. For 2017, the company wants its new iPhone to make a huge splash and have people camping outside its stores waiting for one.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut no matter how cool AAPL makes the iPhone 8, would people pay $1,000 or more for one?iPhone 8 RumorsOver the past several months, rumors have been building that AAPL is going all-out with the iPhone 8. After three years of looking essentially identical - good luck telling an iPhone 6 from an iPhone 7 without actually powering it up - the iPhone 8 is going to look different.Justhowdifferent is where the rumor mill comes in.However, the money is on Apple dropping the aluminum back in favor of anall-glass design. Making the new iPhone pop even more is the expectation of an OLED display that ditches the bezels and even the Home button.A new iPhone that looks completely different from the models of the previous three years is expected to boost sales as Apple fans trade in their old phones. There also has been speculation that AAPL will take advantage of the 10th anniversary to charge a premium for the iPhone 8.But a new report suggests that could be higher than expected.Is the Market Ready for a $1,000-Plus iPhone?Fast Companyreports that AAPL isn't just looking to boost sales with the iPhone 8,it's looking to cash in on upgrade fever.The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansCiting a source with ""knowledge of Apple's plans,""Fast Companysays the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will indeed be the all-glass design (with a stainless steel band) and OLED display. At 5.8 inches, it will be larger than the iPhone 7 Plus. It may even have a cooler name than iPhone 8: ""iPhone X"" is being thrown around.And according toFast Company'ssource,it will likely start at over $1,000.In comparison, previous iPhones have traditionally had a $649 starting price. When the Plus models were introduced, AAPL started those bigger iPhones at $749, boosting that to $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.Can Apple Pull Off Such an Expensive iPhone 8?There's no question that $1,000-plus is averyexpensive smartphone. That's basically $250 more than AAPL has ever charged.EvenSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only hit $849 with its flagship (and doomed) Galaxy Note 7. That phablet has a great deal in common with the iPhone 8's expected features, including an oversized OLED display and wireless charging.However, Apple is undoubtedly emboldened by the success of its more expensive Plus phone in the last quarter. Despite carrying a premium (and the iPhone 7 Plus price hike), in the previous quarter, sales surged for the larger, more expensive iPhones. The iPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for40% of iPhone 7 sales worldwide- double the share of the iPhone 6 Plus.Fast Company'ssource says Apple will also offer the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in 2017. That positions the iPhone 8 - or iPhone X - as a true premium offering. Anyone who wants a new iPhone would still have the option of buying the standard offerings (which would continue to be among the best smartphones on the market).Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3But for those with deeper pockets who truly want to make a statement, then the $1,000-plus 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be there.It's a risky strategy, but it could pay off big-time for Apple.As usual, this early in the year, speculation about AAPL's new iPhone plans is just that - speculation. So stay tuned as more details leak and we get a closer to a definitive picture of what the company is up to for fall 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning, as Wall Street weights its options ahead of the latest round of corporate earnings and a smattering of economic data. Among today's earnings headliners areTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), while weekly jobless claims and wholesale inventories round out the economic reports.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.16%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.16% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.1%.On the options front, volume surged to well above average on Wednesday, driven mostly byApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call traders looking to capture roughly $3.1 billion in dividends. Overall, about 16.9 million calls and 12.7 million puts changed hands yesterday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.69, though the 10-day moving average ticked higher once again to yet another three-month high at 0.71.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders, Apple call traders scrambled to get a chunk of the roughly $3.1 billion in dividends the company will be paying out on Feb. 16, to  those who were shareholders as of yesterday. Meanwhile,Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) retreated on mixed options volume as guidance for its hepatitis C treatment was lower than expected, andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) was bolstered by supportive comments from BMO Capital.Apple Inc. (AAPL)In a frenzy that pushed Wednesday's total overall options volume well above the daily average, Apple call traders flooded the stock with in-the-money Feb contracts. Total volume rocketed to a near-term high of more than 4.2 million contracts, with calls gobbling up 88% of the day's take.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe most popular strikes were the Feb $125 and Feb $120 calls, whereTrade-Alert.comnotes that a plethora of 12,000 and 13,500 contract blocks traded late in yesterday's session.For traders who managed to gain control of AAPL stock shares by the close last night,Apple is paying out 57 cents per share on Feb. 16- for a rough total of about $3.1 billion to all shareholders of record.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)Bright and early yesterday morning,Gilead posted a fourth-quarter profitof $2.70 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion. While both figures were down year-over-year, Gilead managed to beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter. Guidance, however, was another matter.It seems that Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drug was considerably more effective than expected, all but curing the disease and lowering expectations for sales in 2017. Going forward, Gilead expects to sell between $7.5 billion and $9 billion worth of hep-C treatments, far below Wall Street's expectations for $12 billion.Options traders were torn on GILD stock's reaction. Volume tagged over 554,000 contracts, with calls eking out 53% of the day's take. Still, with GILD plunging more than 8.6% yesterday, the shares are now trading well below all major call accumulations in the Feb series, while the roughly 19,000 puts at the Feb $70 strike are trading nearly four-points in the money.With GILD at its lowest point since 2014, some of yesterday's call action may have been bargain hunting in a bid for an oversold bounce for the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)WhenBMO Capital commented on PC and laptop salesfor January and February, it wasn't exactly the most bullish of outlooks. Sales were slightly lower than expected in January and February's outlook was similar, with the Chinese New Year affecting demand. However, BMO said that its ""outperform"" rating for AMD wouldn't be affected, and the uptick in demand following the Chinese New Year may actually help AMD.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3With the shares riding high following rumors of anIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC)licensing deal, it was all the nudge AMD bulls needed to double down on call options. Volume on Wednesday remained strong at 355,000 contracts, while calls snapped up 70% of the day's take.AMD is now trading well north of most major call accumulations in the Feb series, with only the roughly 8,000 contracts at the $14 strike remaining in its way. Meanwhile, most options traders have narrowed their focus to the Feb $13.50 strike, especially put traders, with about 10,000 of these bearish bets now residing at the strike.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

While I'm usually not one to chase a stock after such move, for BAC stock, I'm willing to make an exception.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI'll warn you that this trade will be a boring one. But when selling premium, boring is beautiful.Financials have experienced a general reset of levels. The promise of reduced regulations stopped traders from looking down into the abyss lows of bank stock prices. Instead, investors are now looking up toward all-time highs.Thing is, both extreme opinions are usually wrong, and that's why I like selling risk against extreme opinions. Because the truth lies somewhere in the middle.Instead of buying BAC stock, I will look toward the options market. I don't plan on actively trading financial stocks, so I want to make this trade last me all year.The idea is to sell someone a lottery ticket. The secret? Choose a level in BofA so their ticket will be their loss … and our gain.How to Trade BAC Stock NowThe trade:Sell the BAC Jan 2018 $15 put for 35 cents per contract to open. By selling a naked put, I commit to buying Bank of America shares if they fall any lower than my strike. I only do this if I'm willing and able to own the stock at a 30% discount should it fall to me.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenSelling naked puts is not suited for everyone, of course. But I can modify the trade to better fit milder risk profiles.The alternate:Sell the BAC Jan 2018 $15/$13 credit put spread for 17 cents per contract - a potential yield of 9% on money risked. Both trades have a 90% theoretical chance of success based on today's data.Click to EnlargeI do have to recognize that technically, BAC stock is vulnerable to some downside if recent support fails and the triangle (pictured in the accompanying chart) breaks. But that also could present an opportunity, because more buyers could step in if price breaks above the triangle.In that case, I would add a bullish call position in Bank of America to capture the breakout. Otherwise, time will do the work for me on the puts sold.I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration.

Indeed, TSLA stock holders have something new to process nearly every single day, and the occasional weekend day to boot.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThis week was no exception, and three of this week's developments are doing most of the driving right now:Tesla is taking a big step toward Model 3 production starting as planned.Tesla wants to enter India later this year.Short sellers are increasingly betting against Tesla stock as a rather amazing rally has unfurled since the end of November.Here's a little more perspective on all three matters owners of TSLA stock may want to digest, for better or worse.Model 3 Production Beginning SoonThe details on the matter are scant to far, but on Thursday morning, Tesla announced it wouldshut down its California plant this monthto get ready to produce Model 3s, and might begin building the prototype Model 3 as early as Feb. 20. The company anticipates full-scale production beginning later this year … in July, as initially suggested by Musk.The market knew it was only a matter of time, but to see it happening can elate current and would-be owners of Tesla stock. Somehow, the goal of producing 500,000 vehicles per yer by next year doesn't seem out of reach.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe company is believed to havereceived nearly 700,000 reservations- complete with deposits - for the Model 3, which is expected to sport a sticker price of around $35,000.IndiaThe news came as a tweet on Tuesday - a response to a question to CEO Elon Musk via Twitter, actually. In less than 140 characters, Musk said hehopes to enter the Indian market by this summer.The knee-jerk response is optimism; entering new markets means more revenue potential. It's the second thought that raises questions, though. India is a poor country, per capita. The average annual income in India is $5,630. Worse, median income is $616. It's not likely many of those consumers are even thinking about buying a TSLA vehicle.There's a curious nuance with the way India's income is distributed, though.In India, the richest 1% of the country controls 58% of the nation's wealth. That's one of the world's most extreme levels of wealth disparity. And when you're talking abouta country with a population of 1.33 billion, it doesn't take a large proportion of the population to create a decent-sized pool of potential buyers.And for what it's worth, the more manufacturing Musk can do in that country rather than import vehicles into India, the better, in terms of marketability. At the same time, though its consumers still aren't as flush as they are in other parts of the world, that's changing.Manhattan Venture Partners' Santosh Rao recently opined, ""The market opportunity is too compelling to ignore. India has a growing middle class with rising disposable income. The manufacturing cost will also be relatively lower.""Short SellersTheWall Street Journal'sBen Eisen was right about one thing this week:Tesla's short-sellers are a persistent bunch.Thing is, they may be a little too persistent for their own good.The 44% gain that TSLA stock has dished out since the first day of December, amazingly enough, wasn't a short-covering one. As of mid-January,35.04 million shares of TSLA stock were held as a short position, up from the total as of the end of December, and well above the mid-November tally of 31.5 million shares. That's essentially a $9.2 billion collective bet against Tesla, according to calculations from S3 analyst Ihor Dusaniwsk.The bears aren't backing down, betting against Tesla stock as it ticks higher. The mid-January reading is almost a record-high short interest.Big mistake.This is a stock that the market still loves to love, and though it has been a love-hate relationship at times, there's been more love than hate. That hasn't changed recently. Indeed, if anything, as production of electric vehicles scales up, margins should improve. Don't forget that Teslaswung to a profit last quarter, and may well surprise again later this month. It shouldn't take much more upside in TSLA stock to flush these bears out of their short trades, augmenting any rally - the only way to close out a short trade is by buying the stock.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventBy the way, Dusaniwsk estimates that the collective short positions entered of late are have translated into unrealized losses of $2.27 billion. Those traders are apt to be getting very antsy.Bottom Line for Tesla StockTesla still has plenty of hurdles ahead. Namely, it's still spending heavily on …well, pretty much everything, and it remains to be seen if the integration with SolarCity will bear fruit.But, the potential of India is a positive for Tesla stock, as is what is ultimately an ill-advised wave of short-selling of TSLA shares. The prospect of the Model 3's production beginning soon. of course, is a show-stopper.Although a technical dip in the near-term may be in the cards, this week's news can be scored as a pair of wins in the ledger.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSchlumberger Limited (SLB) Stock Could Be a Gusher.

Surprise, Surprise: Google, Amazon, Microsoft All Donated to Trump's Inauguration;2/8/2017;"On Tuesday,Politico confirmedthat come of the biggest technology corporations in America donated to President Trump's inauguration last month, the same companies who have recently voiced opposition to the administration's controversial immigration policies.Citing federal ethics documents, as well as sources familiar with the matter,Politicoreported that AmazonAMZN, Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLdivision, and MicrosoftMSFTall donated both cash and services to the president's inauguration back in January. Microsoft, for example, contributed $250,000 in cash, in addition to the same amount in technology and other tools, on December 28 to the Presidential Inaugural Committee.Google apparently provided an unspecified cash donation and a YouTube livestream of the inauguration, while Amazon gave similar services including tech help and an undisclosed donation. FacebookFB, though giving no cash donation, did provide Instagram photo booths and a mini Oval Office for those celebrating.It's quite common for corporations to donate to inaugural committees, regardless of political party affiliation. Microsoft donated about $2 million in cash and services for President Obama's second inauguration, while BoeingBAgave $1 millionto President Trump's inaugural events despite the president's attacks on the airplane maker.Just last December, the top executives of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, as well as CiscoCSCO, IBMIBM, IntelINTC, OracleORCL, and TeslaTSLAmet with President Trump in a so-called tech summit where the group discussed the growing uncertainty over the then president-elect's economic policies and the impact on the tech industry.The meeting seemed to create a sense of peace between the president and the tech executives, especially after a bitter election season, but President Trump's recent executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States upended that concord. On Monday, over 100 tech companies, including many of the above as well as Apple (AAPL) and Twitter (TWTR),told a federal courtthat they ""oppose the president's executive order because it's bad for the country and hurts their ability to attract talent,"" notesPolitico.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems unlikely that from a fundamental standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earnings report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora already announced last month that fourth-quarter results would come in ahead of guidance for both revenue and adjusted Ebitda. That disclosure sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibility that the numbers in the Pandora earnings report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news coming out of Pandora earnings. The company has set itself up for a busy 2017. The replacement of Pandora One with Pandora Plus appears to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentary on that initiative will be closely watched on the Q4 conference call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announced a new ""Premium"" service to compete with offerings fromSpotify,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThat product should roll out shortly, potentially boosting growth in 2017. And Pandora has said it is aiming to return to Ebitda profitability in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investors in P stock should believe the company.A Busy 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actually is up about 65% over the past year, after coming close to all-time lows in early 2016. Those gains have come despite mixed performance in the business. Revenue is up 14% through the first nine months, and likely rose a similar figure in Q4. But about half the year-to-date growth came from the acquisition of TicketFly last October. Advertising revenue also increased 14% through the first three quarters - but came solely from higher pricing. Active users were actually down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscription revenue declined in the quarter as well.The user and subscription figures are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simply doesn't trust that Pandora can create consistent profits based on advertising revenue alone. That's particularly true given thehigher royalty ratesthat took effect at the beginning of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrade One to Plus - adding features like song replays - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-based model.The plan from Pandora, as detailed after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provide a more stable revenue base. Moving customers to subscription-based services both helps margins and improves retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock likely will rise. But that remains a relatively big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earnings report, then, the most important numbers likely will come from the company's guidance. That guidance will give some color as to how successful management thinks Plus has been so far - and what kind of opportunity Premium has to boost Pandora earnings this year.But the Pandora earnings conference call also seems like it might move P stock. Management will have another opportunity to detail its strategy for 2017 and beyond. The company laid out its ""three-legged stool"" strategy - Plus, Premium and Ticketfly - after the third quarter, but investors weren't terribly impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsThe issue with P stock is that there's a real fear that Pandora's model simply doesn't quite work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenced by the nearly 80 million active users. But it's not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalty rates through ad revenue alone. The company did announce layoffs ofabout 7%of its employees in a bid to improve 2017 profits. That simply raised additional concerns about Pandora stock. The most notable is: Can Pandora really compete with Apple, Spotify andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?After all, those companies have much larger businesses - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the company has burned about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarters of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is likely to be huge as well, and that's not counting depreciation or the additional $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreciate in the near term, the company needs to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidance given in the Pandora earnings report will be key. But that aside, investors also will be looking for more information on the plan going forward here.Can Pandora find a niche in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offerings from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there really a profitable business model here, or are royalty rates simply too difficult to manage?Those questions can't be answered quite yet, but investors will be looking at the Pandora earnings report closely to better assess the company's prospects. And it's likely the commentary on the future - not the past - that will determine how Pandora stock reacts to Q4 earnings.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. The author does receive royalties from Pandora.More From InvestorPlace4 Energy Stocks That Are Ticking Time Bombs3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundThe postEarnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy best results inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) trades have come fromselling premium against extreme opinions. But in this uber-bullish market environment, I am left only wanting to go long momentum stocks like TSLA orNetflix, Inc(NASDAQ:NFLX).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Wall Street seems to have given up looking at Tesla as a car company. The majority of traders I know perceive TSLA as a technology company centering around the battery and sun power.Although fundamentally, TSLA is a difficult stock to recommend at these levels, technically I can argue it wants to retest the all-time highs soon. Luckily, the options markets give me several ways I can enter long trades while building healthy buffer zones.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaClick to EnlargeThe Trade:Sell the TSLA Sep $200 put. This is a bullish trade priced for $11 per contract to open. The 22% buffer from current levels gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success.If TSLA falls below my strike price, I could be put the stock, so I only sell the naked put if I am willing and able to own it at that level. In that case my breakeven price would be $189 per share.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe Hedge - Optional:Sell the Sep TSLA $340 call and collect an additional $5.50 per contract. This trade has an 80% theoretical chance of success. I need TSLA stock to stay under my sold leg or be open to losses. Taking both trades would put me in a sold strangle and widen my breakeven zone to $182 vs. $357.50 per share. I am not rushing to enter the hedge at this time.Selling naked options on a high dollar stock is definitely not suited for everyone. So I can modify the trade to diffuse its risk.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Sep $200/$195 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade for which I collect $1.20 per contract. I still need TSLA to stay above my spread to win. Yield on this trade if successful would be 25% on money risked. Theoretically, this also has an 80% theoretical chance of success.This alternate trade could be hedged by selling TSLA Sep $340/$345 credit call spread. This would potentially give me an additional 65 cents per contract thereby lowering my dollars at risk. If both sides of the alternates are successful, the sold iron condor would yield 55% on money risked.As I mentioned earlier, TSLA stock is looking technically frisky, so a very bullish play on that would be to sell the puts and buy near-the-money calls to really profit from a rally for free.Note that earnings are coming soon, and those add an extra layer of chance into the mix.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

GM's Race To Win Self-Driving Car War Provides Long-Term Opportunity;2/7/2017;"Like Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOG,GOOGL) spinoff Waymo, Ford (F) and a host of others, General Motors (GM) is going full-force in the race to be the leader in autonomous cars.A new study shows that it's further along than previously thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they're not happy with the company's fourth-quarter results.The California Department of Motor Vehicles released a number ofreportsearlier this month from various automakers and tech companies on what they're doing as it relates to self-driving cars and GM, long thought to be ceding the race, has vaulted its position, thanks to acquisitions and heavy spending.makeArticleAd();Cruise Automation, which GMboughtfor more than $1 billion in March 2016, is using a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its software and its cars out in the field. Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.This is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.It's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it'spartnering with Lyftor adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars inDetroit.Projects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.In the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.It's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.It's just a huge unknown at this point.GM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”The world is still a ways away fromLevel 5 autonomy(true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.But it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about."

Why Tesla, Inc. Stock Soared 18% in January;2/7/2017;"What happenedIn January, shares of electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) extended their march higher, gaining 17.9%,   according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. This comes on top of a 17.5% gain in December.So whatTesla stock's rise during January is likely due to a combination of Tesla   CEO Elon Musk's growing access to President Trump, the National   Highway Traffic Safety Administration's decision to exonerate   Tesla's Autopilot after an investigation of the technology, and   the company's ongoing preparation ahead of its important Model 3   launch later this year.Image source: author.makeArticleAd();In late January, Musk was not only seen meeting with the   president, but he joinedyet anotherforum of executives purposed to give the president advice on   matters. This particular council was formanufacturing policy.Further, after a thorough analysis, the National Highway   Traffic Safety Administration decided tocloseits investigation of Autopilot's performance in an fatal crash   that occurred while the technology was activated. The auto safety   organization not only concluded there were no defects, it also   said the technology is reducing crashes by about 40% -- a figure   Musk said in January he believes Tesla's recently released   second-generation Autopilot sensors can get to 90%.Finally, in January, Tesla continued to make key investments   ahead of its planned Model 3 launch later this year. In   particular, the company revealed that its Gigafactory hasdoubled in sizesince July and is on track to begin volume production of battery   cells for Model 3 in the second quarter.Now whatGoing forward, investors should keep an eye on Tesla's   timeline for its Model 3.

Can General Motors Company (GM) Stock FINALLY Get Some Love?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the three months since it last reported earnings,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) stock has been rising - though not nearly as much as it deserves. Hopefully, the upside for GM stock will continue starting today after the company delivered a solid fourth-quarter earnings beat.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)On Tuesday morning, General Motors reported quarterly revenues of $43.9 billion that were well above estimates.Net income for the quarter was $1.8 billion, or $1.19 per share, hurt by the strong dollar. Moreover, for the full year, the company sold 10 million vehicles - 2.78 million of them in the fourth quarter alone. GM also said that 56,000 employees will each be getting profit-sharing worth $12,000.CEO Mary Barra previously reported thatGM delivered 195,900 cars in January, and while that was down 4.9%, the average selling price was $34,500 - a new record for the month, indicating strong demand. The company is expecting earnings growth during 2017 and has increased its stock purchase program.Since last reporting earnings, GM stock had risen 18%. But even at a Feb. 9 opening price of $37.50 per share, you're looking at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 4.2 and a dividend that yields 4.1%.I can't stress this enough: This is not normal. Not when it's ""normal"" in the current market for a yield of 3% to look appetizing, and where a P/E of 18 is considered average.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Maybe now, those ratios will change.GM Stock: The Most Unloved Equity on The Street?Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.Its January sales numbers, as good as they were, still disappointed the Street, where analysts noted inventoryremains high. Analysts said they were hopeful on the numbers going into earnings, but their hopes were underwhelming. This came despite their noting that CEO Mary Barra has a habit of under-promising and over-delivering, and that her most recent statement on earnings, delivered Jan. 10, was positive.This earnings report was well-telegraphed, but no one took notice. Analysts were expecting earnings of just $1.14 per share on revenue of $42.2 billion. The whisper number was a hoped-for $1.20 per share. And the actual figure came very close to the whisper.Of the 26 analysts covering GM stock, however, slightly more than half rated it as a ""hold"" going into earnings. There was scant momentum toward a ""buy,"" though only for investors seeking income.How High Can General Motors Fly?In a world whereTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is worth $41.49 billion after delivering just76,230 cars, General Motors is said to be worth $57 billion after delivering 10 million.Yes, investors are factoring in a lot more growth potential for TSLA, but even then, this is ridiculous.GM makes money on its cars. GM is delivering a solid dividend of 38 cents per share that it covered three times with the last quarter's $1.19 per share of earnings. GM has five times more cash than Tesla, its cash flow numbers are superior and its sales of electric vehiclesare rising.In a rational investment world, a stock like GM - which has been delivering these kinds of results for five years now - should be worth at least 10 times earnings, and its board should be under pressure to raise the dividend to maintain the yield.2 Ways to Trade Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Before It ShimmiesBut this is not a rational investment world. Such a result would mean a doubling of GM shares, which rose less than 1.5% on the latest news.All this makes no sense, but it doesn't have to.GM stock appeals only to income investors. Those investors should be very happy today, knowing that their income looks secure. The rest can only marvel at how divorced from reality the stock price of General Motors has become.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

How the Allure of Growth Led Solar Installers Down a Destructive Path;2/4/2017;"In business, getting the strategy and timing right can often   be a lot more important over the long term than having the best   product or technology. In solar, many companies have failed   because they took the wrong path to market or bet on the wrong   product at the wrong time.In that vein, one lesson worth looking at right now is how   some solar companies had the right long-term strategy for   residential solar, but abandoned it too early in a pursuit of   short-term growth. Below is a look at how companies likeSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) could have put themselves into dominant position   today, but are instead now at a disadvantage. And how major   players likeTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andVivintSolar(NYSE: VSLR) will fit into the market.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The shifting trends of residential solarThere's been a lot of debate over the past five years about   what the best strategy is for residential solar installers. Among   the notable questions: Is a large, national footprint valuable,   or should companies be more focused on local or regional   markets?In general, larger companies have better technology for   quoting rooftop solar system prices, and better access to self   financing (leases); smaller companies tend to have lower   installation costs, but less access to capital within their   control.There are a few moving pieces there, but this generally   allowed large installers like Tesla and Vivint Solar to grow more   quickly and gave them an incentive to get more customers signed   up for leases or power purchase agreements (PPAs). Small   installers didn't see the same growth because of loans, so   customers could buy their system weren't readily available (until   recently). This left smaller players at a disadvantage.This dynamic led to massive market share gains for major,   national installers from 2010 to 2015 as they broadened their   reach, brought down their financing costs, and lowered   installation costs. But in 2016, something changed. Loans became   easier for smaller installers to offer, giving them a chance to   leverage their lower costs. You can see below that growth shifted   quite quickly from large installers to smaller installers last   year, a trend that will likely continue.Growth of large and medium size installers in the U.S.     Source:GTM Research Q2 2016 U.S. PV Leaderboard.This creates a couple of problems for the large solar   installers. First, and most obvious, is that they won't be able   to grow as quickly. And when stock prices were sky high, it meant   they had a long way to fall. But the more important factor is   that they have set fixed costs like warehouses, trucks,   administration, sales, and installation staff that needs to be   spread across a wide base. A more limited opportunity for growth   will make it harder to pay for those overhead costs.Installers shift to better solar equipmentOn top of the shift toward smaller installers, customers are   shifting toward better solar equipment. You can see in the chart   below that mid-size and long-tail installers favor higher   efficiency and quality modules from manufacturers like SunPower,SolarWorld, andLG,in contrast to the largest installers, which are choosing   lower-cost commodity products from the likes ofTrina SolarandREC.Smaller installers are choosing higher efficiency solar     panels than their large competitors. Image source:GTM Research Module Procurement Trends in the     U.S. Residential Market.When customers are making decisions about equipment, they   generally have different preferences than what SolarCity or   Vivint Solar might pick, but with national installers, they often   don't have a choice in the matter. Some customers prefer   efficiency, some want higher quality, others want U.S.   manufacturing, but the decision matrix is different when it'syour home. And if you can leverage the trend from left to right in the   chart above it'll be good for business.What small installers need to surviveThe advantage small installers have in the solar industry is   lower costs, in large part because they don't need to have the   same capabilities as their larger peers. A small shop with two or   three installation crews isn't going to invest the capital to   build out mapping technology to price specific installations or   custom designed racking components. They're going to lean on   suppliers for many of those products.Ironically, Sunrun was once a leading technology and finance   supplier to medium and small installers around the country,   allowing them to offer lease financing and easily quote projects   on the fly -- capabilities that small shop might otherwise not   have. This strategy didn't require Sunrun to build out a risky   national infrastructure of installers. Similarly,Clean Power Finance, who eventually became financierSpruce, had a similar strategy in the solar industry. These are   valuable offerings given trends today, but that wasn't always the   case.Five years ago, Sunrun and Spruce were betting that regional   and local installers were the future of residential solar, and   today, it appears they were right. But if you looked at the   market in 2014 or 2015, it looked like the national companies   were winning out. Sunrun decided it needed to get into the   actual installation business to keep up with the SolarCitys and   Vivints of the world. They were chasing growth, not allowing the   market to come to them -- which was the biggest mistake, long   term.Following the pack comes back to bite SunrunIn 2016, the home solar power market shifted away from leases   to loans and from large, national installers toward smaller   companies, and big  residential solar stocks took a bath as   a result. Where it looked like SolarCity (now owned by Tesla) and   Vivint Solar had the right strategy, which Sunrun followed, their   leadership advantages were just a temporary phenomenon that   prevailed until more competitive market driven by small   installers emerged. Sunrun could have been a leader in today's   market, but now it's stuck with the infrastructure of Tesla or   Vivint without the benefits of a company serving small   installers.Sometimes, companies can have the right strategy but be too   early to the market. That appears to be what happened to Sunrun,   which was offering the services that small and mid-size   installers need today, but went off track chasing the growth its   competitors had by getting into the installation business.Today, national solar companies are struggling, and Sunrun is   chasing the market withhigher costs than competitorsand fewer capabilities than a company like Tesla (think energy   storage). If they'd stuck with their previous strategy of   providing technology and financing to installers rather than   trying to beat Tesla and Vivint Solar at their own games, they   could have been a great stock for 2017. Now, chasing growth is   coming back to bite them -- and the large residential solar   installers, too.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;2/3/2017;"We're still a few weeks away from investors getting a peek   into fourth-quarter earnings in the solar industry and what   management has to say about 2017. In the meantime, we're seeing   interesting trends in some of the industry's most important   markets and from its most visible companies. Also, it may have   escaped headlines this week, but Elon Musk andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  have made a big bet on solar energy's   future.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Europe and China adapting to cheap solar     energyThe global solar industry is going through some very rapid   changes that investors should keep in mind. Most notable is the   shift of power over the last few years from Europe to China.   SolarPower Europe announced this week that solar installations in   Europe fell 20% from a year ago to 6.9 GW, a level Germany alone   used to surpass on a regular basis. Subsidies have largely dried   up and now solar customers are competing on cost, which isn't   terribly easy in some of Europe's less sunny countries.China, on the other hand, is booming, with around 30 GW of   solar installed in 2016, so the country is trying to find ways to   slow growth. It cut feed-in tariff rates by 19% to start this   year and is going to test a certificate program starting in July.   It's not clear exactly how the program will work except that a   MWh of renewable energy production will be worth a certificate,   which will then be compensated by the government in lieu of other   subsidies.As Europe becomes less important to the global solar industry,   China becomes more so, so getting subsidies right will be key for   both regions in the long term.SolarCity is on its way outTesla Motors officially changed its name to Tesla this week,   and the company will soon phase out the SolarCity name   altogether. SolarCity was instrumental in bringing solar to   hundreds of thousands of people, but Musk's dream of a vertically   integrated renewable energy company under one brand needs to be   under the Tesla name.The most notable upcoming change will be Tesla's marketing of   the solar roof, which will directly tie Tesla's future to solar   manufacturing and installation. If it succeeds, it will be   attributed to Tesla's great engineering and product development   machine. Musk has bet big on solar energy, and now Tesla needs to   make it a real part of its business without the SolarCity   name.TerraForm Global catching up""Better late than never"" must be the model ofTerraForm Global(NASDAQ: GLBL) at this point. This week, the company reported   second-quarter 2016 earnings, which have been delayed due to   SunEdison's bankruptcy last year.Revenue in the second quarter was $56 million, net income was   $6 million, and cash available for distribution was $43 million.   Debt on the balance sheet was $1.21 billion, offset by   unrestricted cash of $870.5 million.As TerraForm Global moves toward a potential sale, it's   important to catch up with required Securities and Exchange   Commission filings and give investors a clear picture of   operations. While I'm not very bullish on shares, it's good to   see a strong cash level that offsets some of the risk associated   with the company's debt. But given the uncertainty of TerraForm   Global's future, I'm not confident enough to buy the stock   today.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla, Inc. Earnings: Model 3 to Come Into Focus;2/3/2017;"Electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just scheduled its fourth-quarter earnings   release. The company will post results for the fourth quarter on   Wednesday, Feb. 22, closing out a year of rapid vehicle sales   growth, and marking the first reported quarter with the   November-acquired SolarCity under its ownership.Ahead of Tesla's financial results, here's some background on   key areas to watch when the company updates investors.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();The most important question: Is the Model 3 launch on   track?For Tesla, this will be a critical year. In 2017, the company   importantly plans to launch its first mass-market vehicle: Model   3. The big question, therefore, is whether Tesla's Model 3 is   still ""on plan for volume deliveries in the second half of 2017,""   as Tesla said in its third-quarter update.To put the importance of Model 3 into context, consider that   Tesla expects Model 3 to help the company build 500,000 total   vehicles in 2018, up from Tesla's current annualized run-rate of   100,000 units. In other words, Tesla likely anticipates Model 3   production to come close to 400,000 units in 2018. Assuming the   vehicle, which has a starting price of $35,000, sells for an   average price of $43,000, this would put annualized Model 3   revenue at about $17 billion once production hits these levels.   Indeed, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects Model 3 to   evolve into a $20 billion program, generating $5 billion in gross   profit for the company on a 25% gross profit margin.In Tesla's third-quarter update, the automaker said the   company had completed production line layouts for Model 3 and was   preparing to begin the installation of new body welding and final   assembly lines for the vehicle.""As refinement of the Model 3 continues, we remain on plan for   our timing, volume, vehicle capability, pricing, and margin   targets,"" Tesla said. More recently, the company also said it   expects to begin cell production for the Model 3 in the second   quarter of 2017.Big spending ahead of Model 3Increasing production from an annualized run-rate of 100,000   units to 500,000 units in 2018 is going to require some   significant step-ups in expenses and capital outlays.Tesla car factory. Image source: author.To this end, Tesla has said it expects fourth-quarter expenses   to help drive full-year non-GAAP expenses up by about 30%, with   management citing engineering, design, an expanding geographic   presence, and ""testing expenses related to Model 3 supplier   contracts"" as primary reasons for the expense growth.Further, Tesla expects capital expenditures for the quarter to   exceed $1 billion, exceeding the company's total capital   expenditures in the past three quarters combined of $759   million.Guidance: How many vehicles does Tesla expect to deliver in   2017?Finally, one notable area to watch in Tesla's fourth-quarter   update will be the company's guidance for vehicle deliveries. In   past fourth-quarter updates, Tesla usually opts to provide a   full-year outlook for its vehicle deliveries.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.It's difficult to anticipate what management expects from   vehicle deliveries in 2017. But guidance will likely represent a   very wide range given the uncertainties surrounding the timing of   a sharp ramp-up in Model 3 deliveries. However, considering Tesla   has consistently increased deliveries at about 50% annually,   investors should at least look for another year of 50% growth.   This would peg 2017 deliveries at about 114,000. Of course, if   Tesla's Model 3 production ramp-up goes as the company hopes it   will, Tesla could deliver as many as 200,000 vehicles.I'd say it's safe to expect full-year guidance for deliveries   in the range of 115,000 and 200,000 units.Model 3 will obviously be the prime item for investors to keep   an eye on when Tesla reports results. Not only is it critical to   helping Tesla establish itself as a higher-volume automotive   company, but the vehicle's timing is needed to justify big   investments Tesla is already making, including itsGigafactoryandan aggressive expansion at its car factoryin California.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to         buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Tesla Just Proved How Valuable Energy Storage Can Be;2/3/2017;"The impact Elon Musk andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will have on the energy industry may be larger in   the power storage segment than anywhere else. Sure, his company   is a leader in electric vehicles and residential solar, but in   the worlds of automakers and solar energy more broadly, Tesla is   a very small player.Energy storage is another matter: Tesla has been more   aggressive in that space, and could take a leadership position   very quickly. And its product could very well upend the   electricity market as we know it.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Energy storage saves natural gas from itselfThe future of energy can be seen in the emergency energy   storage system built in Southern California after the Aliso   Canyon natural gas storage field's massive leak late in 2015.   Because of that blowout, which released close to 100,000 metric   tons of methane into the atmosphere, operations at the facility   were curtailed, and there was a chance the region wouldn't have   enough natural gas to meet its energy needs at peak times in the   summer, leading to brownouts or blackouts.Most of the time, the issues at the facility weren't a big   deal relative to California's power supply, because there was   still enough energy overall to meet demand. But there was   the potential for a disparity during evening hours, when   people get home and turn on their lights, that demand could   exceed supply. And that was a concern for the grid operators.Their solution was to install a large array of batteries that   could store energy when it was abundant and easily deploy it to   the grid when needed.Sempra Energy's(NYSE: SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric contracted with Tesla,   Greensmith Energy, and AES Energy Storage to build 70 MW of   energy storage with 280 MWh of capacity to offset the Aliso   Canyon outage. Just six months after the request for proposal   went out, the projects were complete.Energy storage added an incredible amount of value to Southern   California's grid, and it did so in very little time. And proving   out these capabilities will allow more energy storage growth in   the future.Filling the needs of a changing power gridThe success of the three energy storage deployments in   California is a milestone that shouldn't go unnoticed. They   filled an urgent need for the grid, were rapidly deployed, and   provide functionality that will allow more integration of   renewable energy sources like wind and solar.As the cost of batteries comes down, applications beyond peak   shaving will provide more value to the grid, and the energy   storage market will continue to grow. Tesla is already pushing   the idea of home energy storage, and companies like Stem,Con Ed, andSunPowerare beginning to build virtual power plants that are a network of   batteries working together. And with battery costs down at least   70% over the past two years to around $200 to $250 per kWh,   batteries are becoming a more economic solution for challenges   the electric grid faces everyday.Building 70 MW of energy storage may not seem like an   earth-shattering project, but it's a big step forward for the   grid of the future. If regulators are impressed with how the   project works, we'll see more like it, and the energy storage   ball will get rolling faster than you might think.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Massachusetts Just Gave a Big Opening to Solar + Storage;2/3/2017;"Believe it or not, Massachusetts has emerged as a leader in   renewable energy and may be trying to advance that leadership   position to energy storage. The Massachusetts Department of   Energy Resources just announced theSolar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART)   Final Program Designreport. This is a structure to compensate small- and medium-scale   solar and potentially storage projects in the state, and it could   become a new model for states across the country.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How Massachusetts' new solar program worksThe structure of Massachusetts' new program takes cues from   auctions around the world that have companies compete to supply   resources to the grid, which makes prices more competitive. There   will be a reverse auction that will set solar prices for blocks   of solar projects ranging up to 5 MW in size. Developers will bid   a price and once the block is filled developers will all get the   same price as the highest bid that will complete the block.On top of the price bid for solar, there will be adders for   smaller projects, low-income neighborhood development, different   installation locations, and storage. I've included the storage   adder matrix below to show an example of what an adder matrix   looks like.The adder matrix for energy storage from Massachusetts     Department of Energy. Image source: Massachusetts Department of     Energy.What makes this interesting is that it gives developers an   incentive to add storage to their projects. And given the adders   are up to 7.6 cents per kWh there will be a large economic   justification for bringing more solar into the fold.Depending on the system's pricing and success, this could   become a model for states around the country looking to add more   solar and energy storage to their energy mix. Prices and adders   may vary by location, but the general structure looks promising,   especially given the competitive nature of the reverse auction   process.Who to watch in Massachusetts energy marketWho is going to win in the Massachusetts market?Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will likely be a big player, attempting to expand   its energy storage presence. I would also expectVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) to be a large player given its big customer base in   the state. A wildcard could beSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , which has a big presence in commercial solar and   has been adding energy storage to the mix, but could be a partner   with third-party developers through its Equinox and Helix   products.Utilities could also have their independent power producer   arms come into the market, although they may prefer just buying   projects when they're completed or working with a partner in the   development process for such small projects. What we should   expect is that when requests for proposals are due, likely this   summer, there will be a lot of interest.As investors, this is worth watching because it could signal   the market is opening up to the value of solar + storage in   future developments. When the price of the two are low enough,   they'll also be able to compete for base load contracts against   fossil fuels and reduce the need for spinning reserves (which   level out the variability of solar). And for solar companies,   that could result in an explosion in the market's potential.   Massachusetts is certainly leading the way.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Volkswagen AG (ADR) (VLKAY) Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've been hard onTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). In my opinion, Tesla is a company built on one crony capitalist deal after another, loaded up on government subsidies, drunk on great PR and sporting a $40 billion valuation - which makes even less sense than the $32 billion it was worth when I wrote about TSLA stocka few weeks ago.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)But Tesla does make a whiz-bang vehicle.So as an investor, there is no way I would buy TSLA stock. I might trade it on either side, but the risk of owning the actual stock is too ridiculous to even contemplate.That's not to say, however, that Tesla stock can't maintain its valuation in a market that doesn't care about valuation.The question is whether or not, over the long term, TSLA falls in line with its true value (which is far lower), or if something happens that results in the stock vanishing off the market in an acquisition.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWhich brings me toVolkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY).VLKAY is in a very unhappy place right now. In September 2015, it admitted that it cheated on exhaust emission tests for its vehicles to make them appear cleaner than they actually were - punching out as much as 40 times the permissible emissions. The car maker is going to spend some $22 billion in the U.S. alone to make good with owners, regulators, dealers and the states.What a mess.So as an investor, my mind thinks about how these two companies might have a synergy of some kind that would take care of their respective problems. Then aFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) pal piped up and wrote, ""VW should buy TSLA.""What a great idea! Not only that, it is actually conceivable.The first problem would be to come up with $30 billion-$40 billion in cash and/or stock to buy TSLA. For most companies, that would be pretty laughable. Yet Volkswagen is not most companies, because about a sixth of it is owned by theQatar Investment Authority, and about 13% is owned by the State of Lower Saxony.Who better to buy out a government-subsidized company that a government subsidized company? Together, these entities also control about 37% of thevoting rights. All it has to do is get another 14% of voting rights on board, from German institutional investors, private shareholders or other foreign institutions, which account for nearly 44% of holdings.This would take care of several issues. First, VLKAY would solve its terrible emissions PR crisis by folding in a ""clean"" approach to its vehicles. It can issue some claim about eventually moving all brands under its name to Tesla's electric model, or in some pairing with its own initiatives.However, with its manufacturing infrastructure, which Tesla doesn't really have in spades, it could theoretically boost the manufacturing capability of TSLA stock. Assuming actual demand for Tesla cars picks up, that demand could be met.TSLA shareholders will get far, far more than their shares are actually worth. Of course, that wouldn't happen at the moment. Shares would have to fall 25% or so before this could even be contemplated.Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is All About the Future, Not the PresentThat is more likely to happen than not considering the volatility of Tesla stock. Also, every quarterly report is like a depth charge for the stock. A good report means the charge sinks to the ocean bottom undisturbed. A bad report and it detonates, and could send the stock to the bottom of the same oceanThen Elon Musk makes a fortune and plows part of his money into SpaceX, before convincing Chinese investors - who are desperate to get their money out of the country - to buy out that company, too.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."

2 Things NVIDIA Corporation Needs to Prove in 2017;2/2/2017;"NVIDIA Corporation's(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price skyrocketed 229% in 2016 and has   left investors wondering if there's more room for the company to   grow this year.NVIDIA has built out a dominant position in the graphics   processing unit (GPU) market for desktop and laptop computers,   but investors are also looking to new growth areas like   automotive and virtual reality for NVIDIA's future.Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();This may never measure up to NVIDIA's stellar performance last   year, but there are two things that the company will need to   prove in 2017 in order to keep momentum going: continue to grow   revenues at a solid clip, and show that investments in new market   segments are paying off.Keep the revenue growth goingEvery investor likes a good earnings beat, and NVIDIA   delivered on that multiple last year. NVIDIA doesn't   necessarily need to beat estimates in order to continue   performing well in 2017, though. Investors should look instead   for the company to deliver on its quarterly guidance and grow its   core GPU gaming business.NVIDIA's management expects revenue of $2.1 billion (plus or   minus 2%) in fiscal Q4 2017, which is in line with analysts'   consensus. NVIDIA has managed to beat analysts estimates for at   least the past four quarters, and it could do the same in Q4, but   investors should be more focused on how the company performs in   thelucrative gaming segment.NVIDIA dominates the desktop GPU market, with more than 70.9%   market share right now, and it should be able to use that   position to sustainably grow revenue and earnings through   2017.NVIDIA brought in 62% of its top-line revenue from its gaming   segment in fiscal Q3 2017, marking a 35% year-over-year increase.   The company needs to prove that it can keep growing its   all-important gaming segment revenue -- overall earnings -- in   order to justify its increasingly high price-to-earnings ratio of   71 (compared to the tech industry average of around 25).Tap into new marketsWhile the company's gaming revenues are the most important for   investors to watch, NVIDIA will also need to prove that its   investments in virtual reality (VR) and the automotive market are   paying off.VR is expected to reach a market size of $70 billion by   2020 and have 171 million active users worldwide by next year.   NVIDIA's GPU market share position means it should have no   problem benefiting from this growing tech segment. But investors   will need to see the company's graphics cards earning more spots   in VR-ready computers.Additionally, NVIDIA has to prove that it can continue   expanding its automotive ambitions. Investors got excited last   year about the possibilities NVIDIA'ssemi-autonomous driving technologieswill bring, and they should expect to see more partnerships and   revenue coming from that in 2017.In fiscal Q3 2017, the company grew automotive revenue by more   than 60% year over year, and a new partnership withTeslashould help the companyexpand its positioneven further this year this year.Good times are likely still aheadNVIDIA likely has more room to grow in 2017, particularly with   the company's core gaming business chugging along so well right   now. But investors' expectations are already sky high after   NVIDIA's run-up in 2016. If the company doesn't show that it can   grow revenues at the same pace (or close to it) and continue   expanding into new segments, some investors may lose   confidence.If that happens, remember to look to NVIDIA's core gaming   business. As long as everything appears in tact there, NVIDIA   should continue to grow over the long term. The company's stock   run-up won't last forever, but that doesn't mean this company   won't be a solid long-term investment if it continues to prove it   can dominate the graphics card market and enter new markets at   the same time.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Drops 'Motors' From Its Name as It Ramps Up Energy Business;2/1/2017;"In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this   week,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) officially dropped ""Motors"" from its name, now   taking on the corporate name of simplyTesla, Inc. The change comes as the company ramps up its energy storage   business and it follows Tesla's recent acquisition of solar   company SolarCity.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();A fitting moveTesla CEO Elon Musk has previously noted he wanted to change   the company's corporate name to just Tesla, citing the company's   growing energy offerings. To this end, Tesla changed its website   from teslamotors.com to tesla.com last year, after the company   purchased the domain from its owner.Recently, Tesla has made its energy ambitions clearer than   ever. In October, Tesla unveiled its solar roof. And, in   November, Tesla officially acquired SolarCity. Meanwhile, Tesla's   energy storage business is ramping up quickly. Just this week   Tesla celebrated its recent80 megawatt-hour battery storage installationfor a California electric utility. This single installation is   more than three times Tesla's record first-quarter 25   megawatt-hours of energy storage deliveries, which management   said spanned four continents and included 2,500 of its   residential Powerwall energy storage products and nearly 100 of   its commercial Powerpacks.Tesla CEO Elon Musk shows a Tesla solar roof cell. Image     source: Tesla Motors.Furthermore, Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel told   Bloomberg this week that its energy storage business ""is growing   as fast as we can humanly scale it.""Fortifying its energy business, Tesla announced a   second-generation Powerwall and Powerpack in October with higher   energy density and slightly lower costs on a per-kilowatt-hour   basis.Looking forward, Tesla only expects its energy storage   business to grow more significant. Musk said in a Q&A with   press after a Gigafactory tour in August that he expects   ""exponential growth from here.""By removing ""Motors"" from its name, Tesla is emphasizing how   integral it expects energy storage and solar to be in the   company's mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable   energy.But Tesla is still primarily an electric-car makerOf course, it's going to take more than a name change for   Tesla to truly shift its business increasingly toward energy   products. Investors should bear in mind that Tesla still   generates the bulk of its revenue from electric vehicles. Indeed,   even after Tesla's recent acquisition of SolarCity, nearly 90% of   Tesla's revenue comes from electric vehicles -- and this likely   won't be changing anytime soon considering the company is   planning to significantly ramp up vehicle deliveries when it   brings its Model 3 to market later this year.Image source: The Motley Fool.With the help of its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3, Tesla   is planning to increase vehicle production from an annualized   run-rate of 100,000 units today to 500,00 units in 2018.   Therefore, even exponential growth in Tesla's energy storage and   solar businesses over the next two years is unlikely to reduce   the importance of electric vehicles to Tesla's overall   results.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model S Fails To Receive “Top Safety Pick” From IIHS;2/1/2017;"According toCNBC, just one slip-up prevented Tesla from receiving the coveted   ""Top Safety Pick"" award:For the Model S, one crash test where the electric car did     not get the highest rating of ""Good"" was the small overlap     front crash where it was given an ""Acceptable"" rating by the     IIHS.In these specific IIHS tests, test dummies sustained head   injuries when their heads hit the steering wheel. The IIHS also   had concerns about potential leg injuries.makeArticleAd();""Neither of these (potential injuries) were so high that we     would expect life threatening injuries, but they are too high     in our opinion to get ""Good"" ratings for those body regions,""     said Dave Zuby with IIHS.Tesla responded by touting its sterling safety record:""We are committed to making the world's safest cars, and     Model S has previously received a 5-star safety rating from the     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a 5-star     rating from Euro NCAP. Model S still has the lowest ever     probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA,"" said a     Tesla spokesperson.BMW's all-electric i3 crossover SUV also failed to receive the   ""Top Safety Pick"" due to concerns around another type of crash.   Tesla noted that recent production changes to the Model S   includes updates to address the IIHS issues, and ""We expect to   receive the highest possible rating in every category, making   Model S eligible for the IIHS Top Safety Pick award"" when the   newer version is tested.Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)rose $0.81 (+0.32%) inpremarket   tradingWednesday.

"Tesla: 80 Megawatt-Hour Battery Installation ""Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg""";1/31/2017;"Electric-car, battery, and solar companyTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) took a key step this week in advancing its nascent   energy storage business when it celebrated the world's largest   lithium-ion storage installation at electric utility Southern   California Edison's Mira Loma substation. But despite its   unprecedented scale, Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel   said the project is ""just the tip of the iceberg in the future of   how much storage we are going to see on the grid.""Tesla's Mira Loma substation energy storage installation.     Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Tesla's Mira Loma installationTesla's completed lithium-ion battery storage installation   boasts 80 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery capacity and helps   Southern California Edison provide more reliable electricity for   about 15 million people. Tesla says the batteries could store   enough energy to power 2,500 homes all day, or 15,000 homes for   four hours. The energy storage installation, along with two other   similar energy storage projects for the electric utility by two   other companies, will help the utility operate a flexible grid   that delivers clean energy, said Southern California Edison CEO   Kevin Payne at a ceremony acknowledging the project's   completion.As the largest energy storage project Tesla has deployed yet,   the company's late-2016 introduced Powerpack 2 units were used   for the utility-scale system. The updated Powerpack builds on the   company's first-generation Powerpack, which was first introduced   in May 2015. The new Powerpacks, which have 200 kilowatt-hours of   capacity, have twice the energy density of the first-generation   versions. Further, the Powerpack 2 has a new, Tesla-designed and   produced inverter, which Tesla asserts is ""the lowest cost,   highest efficiency and highest power density utility-scale   inverter on the market.""While the pricing details of Tesla's Powerpack project for the   Mira Loma substation weren't made public, Bloomberg's New Energy   Finance analysts believe it's possible that Tesla flexed its   unprecedented scope of its new Gigafactory in Nevada to   ""establish new floors for pricing, forcing the industry to   follow,"" Bloomberg's Tom Randallreportedon Monday.Ramping upImportantly, this project follows Tesla's announcement in   January that the company had doubled the size of its Gigafactory   since last July to a 1.9 million-square-foot footprint and 4.9   million square feet of operational space on the building's   multiple levels. In addition, Tesla said in January the company   had begun mass producing the company's new, high-performance   cylindrical ""2170"" lithium-ion battery cells for use in its   energy storage products, with cells for its upcoming Model 3   vehicle scheduled to begin in Tesla's second quarter.Tesla Gigafactory. Image source: Tesla Motors.As the company continues to build out its Gigafactory, Tesla   is ramping up energy storage production at exponential rates, and   the economics of Tesla's Gigafactory are playing a key role in   making Tesla's value proposition compelling. Not only were all of   the products for the installation built at Tesla's Gigafactory,   but Tesla emphasized the U.S.-based production dramatically   increased the speed with which the company was able to produce   and deploy this battery storage.""That's part of how we were able to do this site in such a   fast response time, literally if we had to ship things from   overseas, that would have taken up a third a third of the   available time for the entire deployment,"" Straubel explained at   the ribbon-cutting event. Tesla's scalability and rapid   deployment will be ""key to advancing energy storage on the grid,""   Straubel said.Tesla eventually hopes an 80 MWh installation will be dwarfed   by the total levels of energy storage the company is regularly   deploying. By 2018, Tesla is planning for the Gigafactory to   support 350 gigawatt-hours of annual cell production for its   vehicles and energy storage products combined. Meanwhile, Tesla   apparently already has its work cut out for it: ""It's sort of   hard to comprehend sometimes the speed all this is going at,""   Straubel told Bloomberg.

Why Investors Should Listen When General Motors Talks About Self-Driving Cars;1/29/2017;"Many investors think that autonomous vehicles (AVs), or   ""self-driving cars,"" will transform the landscape of the   traditional auto business. While I think it's premature to pick   winners and losers, it seems clear that at least some of the   winners will come from outside of the traditional auto industry   network.Some, but not all. One century-old Rust Belt giant is   increasingly confident that it will be among the winners as   self-driving technology goes mainstream -- and if you've followedGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) under CEO Mary Barra, you know that when GM talks   about technology, it's worth paying close attention.Why GM thinks it will be a self-driving leaderEarlier this month, GM President Dan Ammann explained why the   General's management team thinks GM is well-positioned to lead in   the coming era of self-driving vehicles: ""We have been very   consistent, I think, in our external messaging on autonomous   vehicles and ride-sharing and what we see the opportunity to be.   We think this could be a very, very large, addressable market, in   autonomous and ride-sharing at scale, and we believe that we have   assembled all of the pieces that we need to lead in this   area.""makeArticleAd();This slide from Ammann's presentation shows those ""pieces"" as   GM sees them.Image source: General Motors.Most tech-oriented investors probably don't think of GM as a   leader when it comes to vehicle connectivity. But most of us have   seen those OnStar buttons that GM has been installing in its   vehicles for 20 years now. Put two and two together: GM has taken   the OnStar technology and connectivity platform -- and the   lessons it has learned over the last two decades -- and is   transforming it into a comprehensive platform for the connected   vehicles of the not-very-distant future.As for GM's vehicle platform, the photo says it all.   Ammann:We believe we have the right vehicle platform for AV. We     think the only long-term sustainable path for autonomous     vehicles is fully electric. And we're obviously in a leadership     position with the Bolt. All of our AV development that's going     on is based on the Bolt platform.The all-electric Bolt is already in mass production at GM's   factory in Orion, Michigan. That factory has plenty of capacity   to ramp up, if and when demand for the little electric crossover   increases. ""Manufacturing capability"" is a big challenge for new   industry entrants, but it obviously isn't going to be an issue   for an auto-manufacturing giant like GM.A Chevy Bolt with a prototype self-driving system testing     near GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan. Image source:     General Motors.As for network, that was a key to GM's investment in   ride-hailing start-up Lyft, as Ammann explained: ""And then on the   network, we have our alliance with Lyft, that's one year old now.   And we think it's been very successful in terms of both the   short-term opportunities we've been pursuing in relation to   Express Drive, but also, obviously, the ultimate goal here of   deploying autonomous vehicles into a shared network.""But does GM really have its own self-driving technology? How   can an old Detroit company keep up with Silicon Valley? Part of   the answer is that GM bought a San Francisco-based self-driving   start-up, Cruise Automation, last year. Here's the rest, per   Ammann:So what I'd like to do now is just give you a little bit of     perspective on where we are technology-wise here. Over the last     12 months, particularly through most of 2016, there's been a     lot of hype around AVs and new business models and so on, and     all kinds of noise and perspectives out there. And frankly,     what we've been doing as a company, we've been really sort of     working. We've been working in the background. But we thought     it was time to give you a little bit of perspective on where     we're at.So any time any of us from the leadership team are out on     the west coast, we stop by to see the Cruise team and     typically, we'll take a ride and join one of the development     rides in the cars and see how the technology is evolving. And     what I'm going to show you is a video of a ride that I went     on.Amman explained that this video is from a ""regular development   ride,"" not a special ride done just for the video. It's sped up,   but it includes all 22 minutes of the ride that Ammann took, in   the back seat of this vehicle as the video was filming.""Twenty-two minutes, fully autonomous, zero driver takeovers,   zero driver intervention,"" Ammann said. ""The whole ride was   entirely controlled from the Cruise mobile app.""""So there you go. It's real,"" he said. ""From a technology   point of view, we think a ton of progress has been made. There's   still a lot of work to do, safety, integration and so on. But   this, hopefully, gives you a flavor for how quickly we think this   is moving along.""The takeaway: It's a mistake to overlook General Motors' tech   right nowHere's the takeaway as I see it for investors interested in   self-driving cars and the intersection of technology and   autos.A lot of tech-minded investors, analysts, and pundits didn't   take GM seriously when it first rolled out the concept version of   the Chevy Bolt two years ago. How could hidebound old GM hope to   compete withTesla Motorsand other Silicon Valley darlings, they asked.Fast-forward to today: The Bolt is shipping, and real-world   testing has shown that it exceeds the targets GM announced when   it showed that concept Bolt in early 2015.That's one of many areas in which GM has delivered on   expectations set by Barra, Ammann, and the other members of the   General's management team over the last few years. That's why I   think it will turn out to be a big mistake to look past GM when   talking about self-driving cars.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Self-Driving-Car Facts You Need to Know;1/29/2017;"Driverless-car stocks could be gearing up for their best year   yet. But beyond company fundamentals, there are regulatory   reasons to be worried about the future of autonomous vehicles.   Here are three things you need to know before you turn the key on   driverless-car stocks.Image source: Waymo (Alphabet)makeArticleAd();1. Driverless cars have killed,but they may be safer than humans.Last May, the driverless-car dream turned into a nightmare. ATesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S owner had Autopilot engaged on a highway   when a truck drove across its path. Neither Autopilot nor the   driver noticed the trailer because of its white color against a   sunny sky, resulting in the first recorded death resulting in   part from a driverless-car technology failure.While this tragic crash has rightly attracted the attention of   regulators, investors, and concerned citizens, it's important to   put this occurrence into perspective. Every year, 35,000 drivers   and passengers die on America's roads -- that's equivalent to one   death every 15 minutes, and 94% of those are caused by human   error. Given driverless cars' overall track record, the safety   comparison between human- and computer-driven cars clearly points   to an automation advantage.These sorts of empirical analyses are important for investors   and can be even more essential when alarming news (such as a car   crash) emerges that might cause a short-term stock price swing.   On the first trading day after news of the crash was announced,   Tesla Motors stock dropped 4%, but it bounced back up for a 2%   overall increase by the end of the day. Steady investors can   ignore the swings and focus on statistics instead.2. Not all self-driving cars are created equalImage source: Getty Images.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has defined   a five-level continuum to determine how self-driving a car really   is. At Level 0, the human driver does everything. At Level 4, the   human does nothing. Self-driving-car stocks have taken different   approaches to deciding just how driverless they want their cars   to be, but most have come to the conclusion that semi-driverless   cars can actually be the most dangerous. That's because between   level 0 and 4, humans might have to take over when something goes   wrong -- and humans are generally terrible at reacting quickly   and safely. That's why companies that aren't innovating beyond   assisted automation may soon be left behind.Those that are going for full automation, such asFord,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Volvo, may be the ones that   ultimately become market leaders, even if their technology isn't   currently widespread. In this case, investors should make sure to   not err on the side of picking semi-driverless models over   autonomous prototypes. For example, Alphabet's stand-alone   company Waymo, which doesn't have a steering wheel and is still   considered by most to be a prototype, may actually be a better   investment than ""proven"" lane-departure warning systems, readily   available on almost all high-end vehicles.3. Self-driving-car companies want to be     regulated.Image source: Getty Images.Companies are often at odds with regulators, spending billions   of dollars on lobbying to ensure politicians steer clear of   market meddling. Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars are   taking an opposite approach. Last April, they established the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets"" to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize   the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" Last   month, the group's legal counsel penned an op-ed inThe Hillcalling for a ""single national framework"" to align the country's   regulation and cut down on conflicting local laws and regulations   that could bring driverless-car innovation to a standstill. For   an industry as emerging as driverless cars, this serves as a   smart reminder that investors shouldn't consider regulation to be   evil -- rules are important and can enable the most innovative   companies to push ahead with production.The road aheadSelf-driving-car stocks are hot, and in 2017 they may attract   more attention than ever before. Investors who know the facts and   stick with the stats are likely to come out ahead, so be sure to   keep these three points in mind when making your next   self-driving-car stock pick.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Car Models That Could Get the Ax This Year;1/29/2017;"Which car models are likely to get the ax over the next year   or so?Sometimes, when an automaker plans to discontinue a model, the   company makes it obvious by announcing it -- or by dropping a   strong hint: ""We're closing the factory that makes it."" But other   times, it takes some analysis to figure out which of today's car   models are fated to go the way of the Edsel and Oldsmobile.Here are three models our car-minded Foolish specialists think   will disappear in the next year or so.makeArticleAd();The little car that couldn'tDaniel Miller(Chevrolet Sonic):One vehicle that could be on the chopping block sooner rather   than later isGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Sonic. It's nothing against the Sonic   itself, per se, but the fact is, demand for smaller vehicles is   plummeting while both demand for larger vehicles and a push   toward electrified vehicles are accelerating.The little Chevy Sonic could be cut to make room for new     electric cars. Image source: General Motors.Sales of the Chevy Sonic were down nearly 15% in 2016, and it   remains one of the brand's lowest-volume vehicles. Furthermore,   2016 was the vehicle's worst full year of sales, with only 55,255   vehicles sold; that's down from its 93,518 peak in 2014 and far   below the mid-80,000s sold in 2012 and 2013, its first two full   years on the market.Not only that, but as automakers continue to push toward   electrified lineups, it's worth noting that the Sonic is produced   at the Orion Assembly plant that recently received a $160 million   investment to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV -- and one could   assume that the plant could be the future production location of   GM's next EV project.The Sonic's segment is falling out of favor with the U.S.   consumer, and thanks to President Donald Trump's tweet flurry,   it's less likely that production will be salvaged with a move to   Mexico. That means the Sonic is likely on the chopping block   after only its first model, and its production capacity could be   replaced by a forward-thinking electric vehicle to be produced   alongside the Bolt.The electric car that got left behindTravis Hoium(Nissan LEAF):I'll take the angle of models thatshouldget the ax in 2017. And my pick is theNissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) LEAF.One of the very clear trends taking place in the EV industry   is a move toward long-range full-electric vehicles or plug-in   hybrid drivetrains. According toInsideEVs,Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Model S and Model X are No. 1 and No. 3 in   the category in sales in the U.S., with GM's plug-in hybrid Chevy   Volt taking the No. 2 spot.Sales of Nissan's LEAF have fallen as competitors have     introduced more advanced electric models. Image source: Nissan     Motor Co., Ltd.Falling behind is the Nissan LEAF, which sold 14,006 units in   2016, down from 17,269 in 2015 and 30,200 in 2014. Put another   way, EV sales were up 30% between 2014 and 2016, and Nissan LEAF   sales fell 54% over the same time frame. What Nissan is offering   is not what the market is buying.Nissan knows it needs to increase range beyond the 107 miles   the LEAF can currently travel on a charge. But industry reports   have the unconfirmed base 2018 Nissan LEAF packing just 120 miles   of range, and upgrades only pushing it to about 200 miles. With   Tesla's vehicles already pushing a high-end range of over 300   miles, the LEAF is looking ancient. Add in the fact that the   Chevy Bolt is in dealerships and has a 238-mile range, and that   Tesla's Model 3 is expected mid-year with over 200 miles of   range, and the competition is running laps around Nissan.Nissan was one of the earliest movers in EVs, but the company   hasn't adapted to the market's desire for more range. And I'm   afraid the LEAF is permanently branded as a low-range, uninspired   EV that needs to be scrapped to make room for a well-thought-out   EV that can compete with the next generation of competitors.An iconic car that Americans no longer seem to wantJohn Rosevear(Ford Taurus):It was once the best-selling car in America. Its nameplate   was famously revived by Alan Mulally in one of his first acts   after becoming CEO in 2006. But here in 2017, it looks likeFord Motor Company's(NYSE: F) once-iconic Taurus is on its last legs -- at least in   the United States.Today's Taurus is different from the Tauruses (Tauri?) that   were the best-sellers back in the 1990s, and it's different in   ways that have hit it especially hard as buyer preferences haveswung away from sedansand toward crossover SUVs. For one thing, the current Taurus is   considered a full-size sedan, not midsize, like its predecessors.   Ford's midsize Fusion is still a strong seller, but sales of the   Taurus, like those of most of its full-size rivals, have slumped   in a big way. Ford sold just 34,626 Tauruses in the U.S. last   year, down over 11%. (By contrast, it sold 265,840 Fusions.)Once America's best-selling car, the Ford Taurus now appears     headed for retirement. Image source: Ford Motor Company.It's not just about the slumping market segment, though. The   design of the current Taurus has some drawbacks. Notably, its   back seat is more cramped than you'd expect in a car of its size.   That wasn't considered a big deal when it was all-new way back in   2010, but it's a big deal now that cushy back seats have become   an important selling point for big (and midsize) sedans. (That   back seat, by the way, is a big reason Ford has struggled to sell   the Taurus as a police car: Cops say that getting handcuffed   suspects into the back seat can be awkward, especially if the   arrestee is struggling.)Ford could fix those drawbacks with an all-new Taurus. In   fact, it did: Fordlaunched an all-new Taurus for 2016that shares its architecture with the new Lincoln   Continental. But Ford is only building it in China, where large   sedans are still popular. There are apparently no plans to start   building it for the U.S. market.The all-new Taurus that Ford builds and sells in China.     Image source: Ford Motor Company.It'spossibleFord could import some examples of the Chinese-made Taurus   to replace the current model for those customers who still want a   big Ford sedan. But I don't think it's likely: I suspect the Ford   Taurus will be gone from the U.S. for good (or at least for a   while) in a year, maybe less.

The Biggest Investment Opportunity Of Our Lifetime;1/28/2017;"Every hour of every day, enough solar energy reaches earth to   replace all energy consumed in a year combined. Every drop of   oil, every piece of coal, and every cubic foot of natural gas;   trillions of dollars of economic value hits the earth every   hour.If we could capture just a small percentage, a measly 0.03% of   the solar energy hitting the world each year, we could be using   clean, home-grown energy, not only in the U.S., but around the   world. And the companies that can exploit this resource have the   chance to upend a multi-trillion dollar industry, something so   revolutionary it may only happen once every few generations. And   it creates the biggest investment opportunity I think we'll see   in any of our lifetimes.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The power of solar energyIt's hard to state just how big the potential for renewable   energy -- and solar energy in particular -- is around the world.   And if the political will is there it would be easy to make an   incredibly large impact on the energy industry over the next   decade. Today, wind and solar power are both cheaper than   electricity from new fossil fuel plants, and there's an abundance   of land in little-utilized locations like deserts, open fields,   and oceans where renewable power could be generated. For the   solar industry, energy production can even be put on rooftops   that are otherwise un-utilized around the world.We're already seeing how cost effective solar energy is in   countries around the world.TeslaMotors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) solar division SolarCity is built on selling   rooftop solar as a cost savings tool for customers.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are bidding on energy contracts around the world   that compete directly with fossil fuels. And with bids now below   4 cents per kWh, they're winning over traditional energy   sources.From a cost basis, solar energy is now competitive, that much   is clear. And solar energy is such a small percentage of energy   production, providing 1% of electricity demand in 2016, that it   has a lot of growth ahead.A multi-trillion dollar opportunityI think it's important to dive into the numbers a little bit   to show just how big the opportunity is for solar energy, so this   next section may get a little weedsy.The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that   global energy consumption will pass 600 quadrillion BTUs before   2020, or in electricity terms 175.8 billion MWh.To show the upside potential for solar energy, let's look at   how much solar power production there would have to be to meet   100% of the energy market's demands. If a solar power plant can   generate its full nameplate capacity 25% of the time, known as   the capacity factor, there would need to be 80,274 GW of solar   power production installed around the world.In 2016, global solar installations were around 70 GW, and   cumulative installations globally are now about 300 GW installed,   a tiny fraction of energy consumption worldwide.To illustrate the potential solar power could have, if we   assume we want to get all of our energy from solar and a solar   power plant lasts 30 years, you would have to install 2,676 GW   every year to transition the world to solar energy. To accomplish   this, the global solar industry would have to grow 35x from its   size in 2016. Put another way, the solar industry could grow   installations 30% every single year and it would still take   nearly 14 years to reach a rate of 2,676 GW per year. And that   figure doesn't even assume any growth.By 2040, the IEA predicts annual energy consumption will be   815 quadrillion BTUs. To fill that gap between 815 quadrillion   BTUs and the 600 quadrillion BTU figure I used to calculate the   figures above a total of 28,800 GW of solar energy would need to   be installed, or about 410x what was installed in 2016.It may sound absurd that solar energy could provide all of our   energy needs, but it may not be all that crazy. Nearly half of   the world's energy consumption is electricity, and the major use   of oil -- transportation -- is starting to be disrupted by   electric vehicles.Cheap and abundant solar could provide a greater percentage of   energy needs as the world electrifies and transitions away from   fossil fuels. The opportunity for solar is worth trillions of   dollars, a huge chance for the companies who grab any significant   part of the market.Why solar profits will go up as the industry growsI've laid out how incredibly big the solar industry's   potential is, but right now it may be hard to draw a line from   the hyper competitive industry we see today to a profitable   growth industry. But this is where the dynamics are changing.Solar energy bids have long struggled to be competitive with   fossil fuels and companies have had to fight each other to win   contracts. Combine that with rapid cost reduction and you have   manufacturers and developers killing each other just to gain   market share.But we're getting to the point where solar energy is starting   to compete with existing energy sources, opening up bigger   markets without the same price competition. And as solar energy   passes coal, nuclear, and natural gas on the cost curve it   doesn't have to lower bid prices as quickly to maintain   competitive. This should allow developers and manufacturers to   slowly expand margins as they cut costs.When you add in new innovations like short and long-term   energy storage and it's possible that solar power plants will be   built to provide a base load source of electricity to the grid,   something that's only been dreamed about in the renewable   industry until recently.Why the investing opportunity is so bigHopefully, it's easy to see why the growth opportunity is   enormous, both from a volume of installation perspective and also   from a dollar perspective. As solar energy beats the cost of   coal, natural gas, and oil as an energy source, it would make   sense that the profits and value of solar companies would go up.   But the market hasn't displayed that potential yet.The chart below shows the market caps of three of the largest   solar companies in the world, First Solar,Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) , and SunPower, compared toExxonMobilandRoyal Dutch Shell. You can see the oil giants are worth over 100x more than the   solar companies.FSLR Market Capdata byYChartsIf we ballpark solar energy from a revenue perspective, the   opportunity is equally impressive. Bloomberg New Energy Finance   estimated that $287 billion was invested in all of clean energy   in 2016, including wind, solar, hydro, and other sources. If the   2,676 GW investment figure I outlined above ends up being true   and solar installations costs are $0.80 per watt (about a 30%   reduction from today) the total value of installations alone   would be about $2.1 trillion.It's impossible to predict how much solar stocks will rise   over the next few decades, but the opportunity for the industry   is easily in the trillions of dollars annually. I think it's   clear that solar energy is the biggest investment opportunity of   our lifetimes. Bigger than computers, bigger than the internet,   solar energy could change the world forever. And the companies   that can take a significant amount of market share could become   the new energy giants, replacing the oil giants we know   today.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Net Metering Is Under Attack: Here's What You Need to Know;1/28/2017;"Utilities across the country are trying to find ways to   undermine rooftop solar, and some states are giving them some   help. This month alone, Wyoming'slegislature introduced a billthat would effectively ban both wind and solar in the state,   including rooftop solar. Indiana's legislature is alsoconsidering a billthat would force rooftop solar owners to sell all of their energy   production to the utility while buying all of their energy from   the utility.It's not yet clear whether either bill will go forward, but   it's clear that utilities and some states are moving to a more   adversarial stance with solar energy. And since state-wide   policies that pass tend to used as models for implementation in   other states, continued regulation of solar could be in the   offing. That could impact solar companies in a dramatic way.Solar panels. Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The rooftop solar industry is under attackNet metering has long been the foundation of rooftop solar   economics in the U.S. A customer with solar could put solar   panels on their roof and use any electricity they could, but any   excess would be sent to the grid. When their monthly bill   arrived, they would only pay for their net electricity usage,   meaning solar energy exported to the grid would effectively be   paid the retail rate. Many utilities argue that net metering   doesn't compensate them fairly for running the grid, but rules to   adopt a fairer structure aren't usually as draconian as banning   rooftop solar altogether.The three companies that would be the most at risk in the   attack on rooftop solar will beTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) . Tesla isn't 100% reliant on rooftop solar after   it bought SolarCity, but Vivint Solar and Sunrun are. If these   attacks are successful, they could be in trouble.Rooftop solar demand was already fairly weak in 2016, leading   to all rooftop solar companies to cut back on installation growth   projections. At this point, it's unlikely there will be much   installation growth at all in late 2016 and early 2017. That's   why any pressure on demand will be a negative, even if it starts   in states like Indiana and Wyoming, which have very little   solar.Why utilities will fail at undermining solarWhat's interesting about the attack on solar is that it'll   only delay the inevitable. Rooftop solar energy is now cost   effective in most of the country if net metering is in place,   which is why utilities are trying to add fees or undercut net   metering rates. But as fees, like demand charges or fixed   charges, go up, it will drive customers to solar + storage, which   utilities can't control as easily.As the cost of solar and batteries comes down, it will   eventually be economical to generate electricity on your rooftop,   store any excess created during the day, and then use stored   energy at night. This wouldn't require any energy exports to the   grid, meaning the utility would have few methods for punishing   customers who choose to go solar. If they did, customers may   eventually find it economical to cut the grid altogether.Tesla is clearly leading the way into solar + storage with the   Powerwall, an energy storage system with an inverter included.   But Sunrun and Vivint Solar are starting to add their own solar +   storage offerings as well. Call it insurance for the inevitable   attack they'll face from utilities afraid of losing their   customers. The attack may be reaching a fevered pitch and   investors will want to watch the developments in test states like   Indiana and Wyoming closely.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors, Inc. CEO Joins President Trump's Manufacturing Council;1/27/2017;"On Friday, the White House announced thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, along with some other executives   from major U.S. companies likeFord,General Electric, andLockheedMartin, will join President Trump's new council to meet regularly for   advising the president on manufacturing policy,reportsCNBC. Musk's appointment to the council further strengthens ties   the electric-car maker CEO has been forming with the new   president in recent months.Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Why it's notableFriday's announcement of Musk's appointment to the new council   further reinforces how the president is giving Musk his   ear. One of the first instances when Musk was given access   to the president was in December, when he was invited, along with   other major tech executives, to Trump Tower in New York City to   Trump'sTech Summit. After attending the meeting, Musk was also reportedly scheduled   for a private meeting with Trump andAppleCEO Tim Cook.Also in December, Musk was appointed to Trump's Strategic and   Policy forum, which, according to a press release, includes ""some   of America's most highly respected and successful business   leaders"" who ""will be called upon to meet with the President   frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as   the President implements his economic agenda.""The access the president is giving Musk is notable,   particularly since many of the other executives appointed to   these councils represent much larger companies, many of which   have market capitalizations of over $100 billion. Indeed, of the   executives at Trump's Tech Summit, every company represented had   a market capitalization of $150 billion or greater. Tesla's   market capitalization is $40 billion.In another display of a strengthening relationship with the   president, Musk, this week, also surprisingly said he believed   formerExxonMobilCEO Rex Tillerson ""has the potential to be an excellent Sec of   State."" Considering Tillerson's obvious ties to the oil   industry, which could potentially clash with Musk's hopes for a   revenue-neutral carbon tax, Musk's support for Tillerson speaks   to his willingness to be open to the Trump Administration's ideas   and strategies.Can Tesla benefit?For Tesla investors, the question is whether all this will   actually benefit the company. With Tesla being in the business of   selling electric cars, energy storage solutions, and solar   panels, the company's mission is tied directly to preventing   climate change, something Trump and Musk haven't seen eye-to-eye   on. But these new ties may be mitigating some investor fears of   sudden political action that could hinder Tesla's businesses.   However, it will be the Trump administration's actions -- and not   its relationship with Musk -- that will matter in the end.TSLAdata byYCharts.Meanwhile, investors seem to at least be giving some weight to   Musk's growing ties to the president. The stock has surged about   38% as Trump increasingly gives Musk his ear.The area in which Tesla looks positioned to benefit most from   the Trump Administration has less to do with the electric-car   maker's sustainable energy agenda and more to do with Tesla's   significant emphasis on U.S. manufacturing. Excluding   contractors, Tesla has created over 13,000 jobs in the U.S., most   of which are manufacturing related. And the company's   2016-acquired SolarCity has created about 12,000 U.S. jobs.Further, Tesla says its under-construction Gigafactory will   employ about 10,000 people at peak production and indirectly   create about 20,000 to 30,000 additional jobs in surrounding   regions. Tesla's growing U.S. manufacturing presence is directly   aligned with one of the president's top priorities to create more   domestic manufacturing jobs.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winning;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMay I be frank with you?General Electric Company(NYSE:GE) is a bit of a bore, and that's putting it mildly. In fact, of the thousands of investments available, GE stock is the one I dread analyzing.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the sexy industry,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has the sexy CEO - or so I've been told - andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) basicallyowns sex. General Electric? It has a 3.23% dividend yield - I think you're getting my drift.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's not to say that GE stock is irrelevant in the current markets. This week, theDow Jones Industrial Averagehit20,000 pointsfor the first time in history.Not only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low.In fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they wereInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM),Goldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS),JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM),Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and standoutBoeing Co(NYSE:BA), which ringed up an impressive 4% move.Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it's easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday's robust gains.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors.GE Stock Is Exciting, and That's Bad!GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons.Click to EnlargeWhile it's very early into the new year, nevertheless, it's worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA.I don't think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%.More worryingly, traders haven't pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results.Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there's a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year - and we've basically burned through two-thirds of that profit.I don't care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it's a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?Just Stay the Course With General ElectricSo should potential buyers heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock has formed an ""inside day"" pattern against the losses incurred by the feeble earnings report. Unless shares can quickly fill the technical gap, momentum definitely leans bearishly. Attempting to catch a falling knife here would not be the greatest idea.Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants InThat said, the month of January is GE stock'skryptonite. The last three Januarys produced a shockingly bad loss of 6%. Since 1962, General Electric has averaged only 0.8% returns for the opening month of the calendar. In nominal terms, there were only 28 positive Januarys over that time frame. That means that GE stock is as useful as a coin toss during the NFL playoffs.However, the industrial titan is a consistent winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an average 13% return. Nominally, 39 years ended sunny side up. This current decade has been particularly robust, averaging over 15%.I've made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you're looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.But even reliable names have their off seasons. Watch General Electric closely, and wait for a baseline of technical support before going in too rich.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20177 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postWhy General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winningappeared first onInvestorPlace."

New Social Tool for Fitbit Inc (FIT) App Doesn’t Solve the Problem;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsKudos toFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) for taking action - any action - as a means of rekindling a quickly-deteriorating business and quelling the free fall FIT stock appears unable to escape. Far too many companies would simply opt to do more of the same, unwilling to admit the organization's wheels were falling off.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitOn the other hand, not all actions are effective, and the one Fitbit is now taking seems more than a little bit impotent. That is, the mission to develop an online ""community"" of Fitbit users sounds great on the surface, but is a bit presumptuous. Is a wrist-worn activity tracker really the foundation for Internet-based friendships?When all is said and done, Fitbit is still unraveling simply because the devices don't compel enough consumers. The implosion of FIT is merely a reflection of that increasingly-harsh reality.Losing InterestAll-things-tech website Digital Trends may have described it best, calling Fitbit's new social experience a""mini-Facebook for your fitness tracker.""Members can share stories, get tips from experts, and communicate with other members about their related journey toward a healthier lifestyle. Usersinterface with the device's smartphone app to enjoy the enhanced experience.It's a clever step forward, to be sure. It can't induce newcomers into making a purchase, though, as not owning a Fitbit device precludes a potential member from joining such a group.The new app also may, or may not, radically change the even bigger headwind for Fitbit and FIT stock. That is, far too many people stop using them shortly after acquiring them.2 Trades to Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) StockTake any numerical estimate with a grain of salt. On the other hand, when several estimates all, more or less, say the same thing, there's likely something to it. And, the dire numbers for Fitbit are15% of users abandon their fitness tracker after 30 days of use, and 42% of users stop using the device after six months. In time, half shelf them for good.That's a pretty steep drop-off rate for a technology that most owners, at one point, considered a must-have. Where it really hurts, though, is the word-of-mouth advertising front, where most sales are ultimately made. If current owners aren't jazzed about their device, they're certainly not going to encourage others to buy one.The addition of a social component to the app isn't likely to make Fitbit devices any stickier or more marketable, particularly now thatconsumers are starting to experience social media fatigue.The really curious, telling part about the high abandon rate? After quitting, former users eitherfound no difference in how they live their lives, or were glad to have one less thing to manage online. Fitbit wearables were supposed to address both of those matters.Red Flags All AroundIt's not as if we haven't seen empirical evidence of the slowing interest - and even a growing disinterest - in Fitbit devices.One piece of evidence is the disappointing Q4 revenue outlook. At one point expected to drive $985 million worth of business for the period ending in January, Fitbit cautioned FIT stock holders in November that it only expected togenerate $725 million-$750 million in revenueduring the all-important holiday quarter. The outlook is barely above the year-ago tally and would extend a developing trend of ever-weakening results.Underscoring that weakness was another report from Cleveland Research, suggesting Fitbit's manufacturersaltogether halted production in the middle of Decemberas inventory started to unexpectedly pile up. Pacific Crest chimed in mid-December as well, saying its channel checks indicated18 days worth of inventory were sitting on shelves, rather than a healthier 5-10 days of inventory. In the meantime, Wedbush Securities analyst Nick McKay opined that, in the shadow of lackluster demand,Fitbit has cancelled some new products planned for 2017.It's a problem simply because older and current products aren't driving growth.Bottom Line for FIT StockPutting all the pieces of the puzzle together, the picture is one of weakness and limited future. Now, we can see it was only a fad, even if a very curious one for a while.3 Breakout-Ready Blue-Chip StocksThat's not to say Fitbit is toast and that the market for fitness trackers is going to completely evaporate. It is to say, however, the market was never as big as touted and upgrades were significantly overestimated. The roll-out of a community-based feature of the app will appeal to a few consumers, but as has been the case to date, for most users it will be just one more thing they don't have time to mess with… and that assumes they're even interested enough to keep wearing their Fitbit.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Bullish Stock Charts That Scream ""Buy Me!""7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaThe postNew Social Tool for Fitbit Inc (FIT) App Doesn't Solve the Problemappeared first onInvestorPlace."

This will include an aluminum Expedition and Navigator, as well as a new Bronco.While Ford's earnings were merely in line with estimates, adjusted net income was up year-over-year, as were revenues of $38.7 billion, which beat Wall Street's expectations.Focus on Next-Gen TechnologiesThe auto industry is in the midst of a technological revolution, as seen with the emergence of self-driving cars. Of course, several mega-tech operators, likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), have been making moves into the industry.Ford doesn't want to be left behind, and has responded in several ways, including investing heavily in developing electric vehicles. The goal is to launch 13 by 2020, including an F-150 and Mustang hybrid. Ford is also laying out its own charging network.Ford also has been working on making their cars more connected. An interesting example of this is a deal withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to leverage Alexa, which will allow for voice-activated shopping, searching and access to smart home features.And of course, Ford expects to have its own autonomous vehicle on the market by 2021. This won't be about sourcing off-the-shelf technology, either. At the recent CES conference, Ford's engineering team said it has been creating proprietary software and hardware systems. That's important to investors because it not only gives Ford more control over quality, but it should keep margins higher, too.Lastly, Ford is working on Chariot, a ride-sharing service similar toUber. It's currently available in two cities, and will expand to eight by the end of the year.Ford Stock's Valuation and FinancialsFord continues to crank out substantial cash flows, which came to$10.4 billionfor the full year.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Too Cheap to IgnoreThis certainly is important to help finance the investments in the company's technologies, but it also helps fund a juicy dividend that's near 5%. It's also note that Ford stock has raised its dividend by 20% since 2014, and paid out two special dividends to boot.Wrap that all up in a stock that trades at just 6 times earnings, and you have to imagine Wall Street has heavily discounted all of Ford's perceived flaws.This is a 4.8% yielder for a bargain price.

10 Facts You Didn’t Know About Tesla Motors Inc And Elon Musk (TSLA);1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElon Musk, South African-born Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, investor and inventor started out his life by dropping out of college to pursue the company he and brother Kimbal set up (Zip2), followed by co-founding X.com (Which is now part ofeBay Inc(EBAY), then even decided to venture further into the business world by setting up SpaceX.makeArticleAd();While Musk is known worldwide as a business magnate, he is probably most well known for his ventures withTesla Motors Inc(TSLA), the American automaker arguably responsible for the recent move towards electric cars.Musk, unbeknown to some is not the founder of Tesla Motors; he is the acting CEO & product architect at the company. He originally joined the company as Board of Directors chairman after he lead the Series A round of investment in 2004, it wasn't until 2008, when Tesla ran into a huge financial crisis, that Musk stepped in as acting CEO and took control of the company.Since joining the company, Musk has overseen the production of the Tesla Roadster, Model S, Model X and soon the Model 3, each time managing to lower the retail price for consumers. He has also trademarked the name ""Model Y"", speculating that he could have a plan for a new vehicle in the future, although this is yet to be confirmed. At the Future Transport Solutions conference in Oslo (April 21st 2016) Elon was quoted as saying: ""There will be future cars that will be even more affordable down the road…With fourth generation and smaller cars and what not, we'll ultimately be in a position where everyone can afford the car"", reinforcing one of Tesla's main aims of creating autonomous cars affordable for everyone.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundIn July 2016, Musk detailed a new master plan he had dreamt for Tesla, which included the manufacturing of more affordable cars at a higher volume, solar powered roofs, mid-size vehicles and even SUV's, showing just how far Musk is willing to go for a new, renewable future.So, here's to the man himself, Elon Musk and his dreams for a bigger, better, renewable future.Now, here are the 10 facts you didn't know about Tesla Motors & Elon MuskInfographic source:stanley-r-harris.co.ukThe post10 Facts You Didn't Know About Tesla Motors Inc And Elon Musk [INFOGRAPHIC]appeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) investors appear to have finally put theSolarCity Corpdeal behind them. TSLA stock has rocketed more than 40% higher since early December, and the shares have even broken through former resistance at $350.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut how long can Tesla shares keep this momentum going?The company has a major roadblock just ahead: fourth quarter earnings. Tesla has missed the consensus estimate in each of the past five reporting periods, save the last quarter when the company blew past the Street's projections.For the fourth quarter, Wall Street expects Tesla to post a loss of 28 cents per share, up from a loss of 84 cents in the same period last year. Revenue is seen rising 27% to $2.22 billion.As with every Tesla earnings announcement, TSLA stock's reaction may depend more on guidance, delivery projections and news on pending and current projects than the actual figures. Traders should keep a close eye out for news on the new gigafactory and any delivery/production updates on the all-important Model 3.Turning to TSLA's sentiment backdrop, we find little in the way of optimism. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that only seven of the 21 analysts following Tesla stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. Furthermore, the 12-month consensus price-target of $240.94 represents a discount to the stock's current trading range north of $250.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryElsewhere, short sellers are loaded for bear heading into next month's report. As of the most recent reporting period, roughly 35 million shares of Tesla stock were sold short, accounting for nearly 30% of the stock's total float, or shares available for public trading.And if these short sellers are nervous about a potential post-earnings rally, they aren't buying calls to hedge their positions. At last check, the February put/call open interest ratio arrived flat at 1, with puts and calls in balance.What's more, this ratio rises to 1.49 for the 10 Feb series (i.e., those options most affected by Tesla's quarterly report).Implieds are pricing in the usual post-earnings move for TSLA stock of about 6.5%-7%, placing the upper bound near $269 and the lower bound at $236. The $269 region is home to Tesla's 2016 highs, and a breakout here could force analysts and short sellers to capitulate. Meanwhile, the lower bound lies near 10-day and 20-day trendline support.So, how do we trade Tesla from here?2 Trades for TSLA StockPut Spread:While TSLA stock is on a solid run higher, I'm expecting a sell-on-the-news event following next month's earnings. Unless the results are stellar and/or the Model 3 is ahead of schedule, expect Tesla traders to take some profits off the table, resulting a pull back in the ensuing week.To take advantage of this retreat, traders might want to consider a Feb $240/$245 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.46, or $146 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $243.54, while a maximum profit of $3.54, or $354 per pair of contracts, is possible if TSLA stock closes at or below $240 when Feb. options expire.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its RangeCall Spread:On the other hand, if Tesla blows out earnings like it did last quarter, and has some positive news to throw in as well (CEO Elon Musk is known for throwing in that one more thing), then TSLA stock could remain in bull mode for a while longer.Traders looking to take advantage of such a bump might want to consider a Feb. $260/$265 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $2.02, or $202 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $262.02, while a maximum profit of $2.98, or $298 per pair of contracts, is possible if Tesla stock closes at or above $265 when Feb. options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right NowThe post2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Consider This All-In-One Biotech Fund With a 10% Yield (CHI);1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the investing world continues to shovel money toward exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (full disclosure: I find myself using them more and more), it's almost as if the grandfather of the ETF, the closed-end fund (CEF), has been reduced to a memory like dial phones or the Nehru jacket. But when I'm at a loss for finding value in an individual stock, I often find myself looking through CEF names like a millennial at a record shop.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');CEFs can trace their origins back to the 1860s in Great Britain, when they were primarily used to raise money to build U.S. railroads. The first American CEFs appeared in 1893, 30 years prior to the first U.S. open-end mutual fund. Prior to the Crash of 1929, American CEFs claimed over $4 billion in assets, which was big money for the time.CEFs have evolved over the decades since, but their organization and basic features have remained relatively consistent. CEFs are and always have been professionally and actively managed, exchange-traded, internally leveraged, and income oriented.Recently, while screening a handful of CEFs, one piqued my interest:Calamos Convertible & Hi Income Fund(CHI).As the name suggests, most of the fund's heavy lifting is done through the use of convertible bonds, which are what is known as a hybrid security. Each bond is convertible to a pre-determined number of shares of the issuer's common stock. This gives an investor two things: an income stream and participation in the movement of the company's stock. Often, convertible bonds are issued by high-growth companies whose common stock does not pay a dividend.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe fact that the fund is managed by Calamos Investments was the attention grabber. Founded in 1977 by John Calamos, Sr., the firm became one of the investing world's premier convertible bond managers. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Calamos at a conference a few years back.Knowing the fund was managed by a true authority, I looked under the hood. 37.9% of the fund, naturally, is made up of convertible bonds while 16.4% is convertible preferred stocks.But what really excited me was the sector allocation.Over 35% of the fund is weighted across information technology and healthcare, represented by disrupters such asTesla Motors Inc(TSLA) andPriceline Group Inc(PCLN).Indeed 19.2% covers the consumer discretionary sector with another 20.3% allocated to financials, energy, industrials and utilities. The fund is noticeably underweight in telecom, materials, real estate, and consumer staples.Debuting in June of 2002 as the bear market of the same year approached its bottom, CHI sports assets of over $1 billion with total internal expenses of 1.25% which is high if you're comparing to a Vanguard index fund. But keep in mind, Vanguard index funds don't have dividend yields approaching 11%.Risks To Consider:Like many CEFs, CHY uses leverage to juice up yields and returns. Currently, the fund's leverage percentage is at 28.57% which isn't too terribly out of whack. However, portfolio leverage is like being lent an umbrella when it's not raining. When the raindrops fall, the lender typically wants it back. Therefore, rising rates are probably the biggest external risk facing the fund. This would create volatility in both the fund's lower coupon holdings and leverage position. But with the link between convertible bonds and equity markets, rising stocks should help offset this risk.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017Action To Take:The unique complexion of CHI offers conservative, income-oriented investors a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the growthiest of growth stocks in a risk-managed package with above-average income. Currently CHI shares trade at around $10.50, which is a 3.5% discount to their net asset value (NAV), with a 10.85% dividend yield that is paid monthly.Editor's Note:Since 1926,one collection of stockshas accounted for HALF of the S&P's return - through every market environment imaginable. If you don't have this group in your own portfolio, you could be missing out on the single best place to put your money this year and next.Learn which stocks can…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

3 Reasons Trump Should Worry IoT Investors;1/26/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.President Trump had his fair share ofverbal scuffles with technology companiesduring his election campaign. But now that's he's the president,   his stance on federal funding for new technologies, tax credits,   and his push for more American manufacturing could have   ramifications for many companies, including publicly traded ones   betting on the Internet of Things (IoT).A few months ago, BI Intelligencepublished some forecastson how Trump's presidency was likely to affect the growth of   the Internet of Things and the companies behind it; now that   the inauguration is over, it's worth giving this information a   good look over.makeArticleAd();Here's what could change:Funding for smart city projects could dry upIn fiscal 2015, the federal government spent $8.8 billion on   IoT projects, and from fiscal 2011 through 2015, it spent a total   of $35 billion for IoT infrastructure, software, and   cybersecurity. One project involved an investment in smart cities   that allowedAT&T(NYSE: T)  bring IoT connectivity to 10 cities across the   U.S. for lighting, transportation, parking, and safety   features.But the BI Intelligence report noted that smart city   projects will likely ""stall or be abandoned due to a lack of   federal support from a Trump administration."" That's because   Trump plans for taxes would reduce federal revenues by $9.5   trillion over 10 years, leading to a major spike in the national   debt and leaving funding scarce for such high-tech infrastructure   investments. They further note that given Republicans' refusal to   acknowledge climate change, programs that subsidize   energy-efficient or green technology projects -- many of which   have IoT aspects -- are likely to have their funding cut or   canceled outright.That's important not just for AT&T and its smart city   projects, but also for broader American IoT innovations. I've   written before thatChina is leading the way in the IoTbecause its government has committed to spending lots of   money to help companies develop new technologies. If the Trump   administration backs away from IoT investments, expect China's   lead on the U.S. to widen even further.Self-driving car innovations could slowIf you're thinking that Trump couldn't possibly have influence   over the autonomous car revolution, consider that   electric-vehicle makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has released some of themost advanced semi-autonomous hardwareand software to date.Many of Tesla's vehicles are purchased with the help of   federal tax credits, but under Trump -- who does not have a   particularly fond view of environmental policies -- green energy   tax incentives could be reduced or eliminated.Tax credits of this type have pushed down the cost of current   plug-in electric cars like the Model S, and could help reduce the   cost of the cheaper, upcoming Model 3. New versions of the Model   S and the upcoming Model 3 will have a full suite of self-driving   hardware built into them, but if that green tax credit   disappears, as an analyst from AutoPacificbelieves it could, then the higher prices could significantly slow the sales   growth of Teslas specifically, and impede the spread of   driverless car technology in general.Automation might be less desirableA big part of the IoT involves companies using an internet   connection and sensors to automate systems and analyze data. In   the manufacturing sector,General Electric(NYSE: GE)  uses internet-connected machinery and software   to increase plant efficiency, both in its own factories and in   those of other companies.In huge plants, keeping track of all the physical parts used   to manufacture a product can be tricky. So instead of keeping the   chaotic and cost-prohibitive old systems (where people would run   around a plant trying to track down parts) GE created its Work in   Process Manager -- powered by its Predix software -- that   automatically tracks manufacturing. The company says that the   system allows supervisors to ""immediately know where any parts or   components are in the plant.""Trump wants to increase the number of manufacturing jobs in   the U.S. which isn't a bad thing. But that could lead to him   attempting to put pressure on manufacturing companies to keep   people employed in jobs that could instead be automated with IoT   tech like GE has developed. If companies fear that using IoT   systems to become more efficient will put them in conflict with   the administration, expect to see some businesses submit, even if   it means their expenses are higher than they would have been by   adopting the newest technology.Of course, there's no guarantee that Trump will cut green tax   credits, reduce federal funding for new smart city projects, or   put any federal pressure on companies that will impair   manufacturing innovations. But he has certainly indicated that   he's willing to push hard against companies when he doesn't agree   with what they're doing -- and that means IoT investments could   certainly be at risk.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why BMW and Nissan are Building Electric-Car Recharging Stations in the U.S.;1/25/2017;"BMW AG(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) andNissan Motors(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) announced that through their joint efforts, a   slew of new electric-vehicle fast-charging stations have recently   been installed across 33 U.S. states -- and there are more to   come.What BMW and Nissan said about the new charging stationsThe two automakers have beenworking together since late 2015to build recharging stations in the U.S. In this latest push, the   two worked with EVgo, the largest U.S. public network of ""DC   Fast"" recharging stations, to add 174 new locations in 33 states.   The stations give EVgo a total of 668 fast-charging stations   right now -- with 50 more, supported by the BMW-Nissan   partnership, set to be added during 2017.makeArticleAd();A BMW i3 and a Nissan Leaf at a DC Fast charging station.   Image source: BMW AG.The stations are 50-kilowatt dual-port DC Fast chargers with   connectors to support both the CHAdeMO (used by Nissan) and SAE   Combo (or ""CCS,"" used by BMW) charging standards, Between the two   standards, any electric vehicle equipped with quick-charge ports   can recharge at these stations.They're fairly fast, too: The stations can charge a Nissan   Leaf or BMW i3 up to about 80 percent in roughly 25 to 30   minutes. That's significantly faster than the Level 2 (240-volt)   chargers that are most commonly available at U.S. public charging   stations.Both companies say they're committed to building a strong   network of public charging stations in the U.S. as part of a   larger effort to encourage Americans to choose electric   vehicles.""BMW's continuing collaborations with Nissan and EVgo, further   demonstrate the company's commitment to building a robust public   charging infrastructure across the country. We recognized early   on that meaningful partnerships like this would be essential in   order to support the expansion of convenient and accessible   electric vehicle charging options,"" said Robert Healey, head of   EV Infrastructure for BMW of North America. ""The expansion of the   plug-in vehicle charging infrastructure will give more U.S.   drivers the confidence to choose an electric vehicle, such as the   BMW i3, as longer distance EV travel becomes increasingly   commonplace.""""Nissan continues as a leader in building accessible   infrastructure to benefit Nissan LEAF drivers as well as all EV   owners. Infrastructure for all is a key strategic priority for us   as we continue expanding the network of dual-port quick chargers   across the country,"" said JeSean Hopkins, Senior Manager, Nissan   EV Infrastructure Strategy and Business Development. ""We look   forward to ongoing teamwork and the continued build-out of public   quick-charge stations.""What it means: Small steps toward an electrified automotive   futureSlowly but surely, America is acquiring some electric-car   recharging infrastructure beyondTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Supercharger network.These 50-kW chargers aren't quite in the same league as   Tesla's Superchargers, which can deliver up to 120 kilowatts and   add 170 miles of range to a Tesla in about 30 minutes. But   at least as of right now, Superchargers only work with Teslas.   And as noted above, these new DC Fast chargers are a significant   step ahead of the most common public chargers available in the   U.S. now. That's important: Wide availability of reasonably fast   chargers will be key to convincing mainstream auto customers to   make the leap to fully electric vehicles.The stations only work at full power with electric vehicles   that have DC fast-charging capability built in. But most new   electric vehicles can be ordered with that capability. It's   standard on 2017 models ofFord's(NYSE: F) Focus Electric and available as an option onGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt.BMW and Nissan are funding these charging stations to help   support sales of their own electric vehicles first and foremost,   of course. But the network will help rival automakers sell their   electric vehicles as well -- and that in turn should help   convince all automakers to make larger commitments to electric   vehicles.Long story short: BMW and Nissan are taking some small but   important steps to help lead Americans -- and other automakers --   toward electric vehicles.10 stocks we like better than BMW AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

To see of all of the 70 or so research reports issued by our analyst team today,click here >>>Q4 Earnings Scorecard: Including all of this morning's earnings reports, we now have Q4 results from 105 S&P 500 members or 21% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 105 index members are up +6.5% on +2.2% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 53.3% beating revenue estimates. This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 105 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector. The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking moderately below other recent periods.You can read about the impact of the new administration on the corporate earnings picture in this article >>The Trump Effect on Corporate EarningsVerizonshares have been laggards over the past year - the stock was up +3.9% over the past 12 months vs. AT&T's +16.8% gain and the +19% gain for the S&P 500 index - and the pressure is unlikely to ease following Tuesday's mixed quarterly report that showed bigger than expected post-paid churn and lower than expected subscriber additions. The company has been actively trying to diversify its business beyond wireless by building a mobile business through the AOL & Yahoo deals and 'Internet of Things' initiatives. But it will likely take a while before these efforts bear fruit. In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst discusses the pros & cons of investing inVerizon sharesat this stage. (You canread the full research report on Verizon here >>)Teslashares have been standout performers lately, with the stock up +25.9% over the past three months vs. +14.7% gain for the Zacks Auto industry. The company's positive updates about the Gigafactory and new deal with Panasonic have helped sentiment, offsetting disappointment over its delivery guidance. The company continues to generate a lot of passion among investors; it has an avid fan base, but also plenty of detractors. The detractors simply don't see any justification for the stock's lofty valuation given the niche nature of the product and the well-known operational and strategic headwinds facing the company.

Better Self-Driving Car Stock: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA Corporation;1/25/2017;"Right now, one of the hottest trends in the semiconductor   industry is the emerging market for autonomous vehicles. It is   generally accepted that to do proper autonomous vehicles, a lot   of computing power is going to be needed inside of the cars to   give them the required ""intelligence.""Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Two companies that have made public their intentions to   aggressively pursue the market for the ""brains"" inside of   self-driving cars are microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) and graphics specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) .Both companies have announced major partnerships and deals   with automotive makers and suppliers. Intel, for instance,   announced last year that it would be collaborating withMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) and Delphi Automotive to build platforms for use by   automotive manufacturers.Intel hasalso saidthat, in 2016, it booked self-driving car deals collectively   worth more than $1 billion in lifetime revenue.Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announced that they would,   together, try to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020.   NVIDIA's components are also found inside ofTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) new vehicles, as well.So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-positioned to   capitalize on a potential self-driving car boom. Which stock is   the better way to play it?These are adjacent businesses for bothIt's important to understand that self-driving car platforms   aren't either of these companies' core revenue drivers today --   they're adjacent businesses. Intel's core business is   microprocessors and related components for personal computers and   data centers, and NVIDIA's core businesses are graphics   processors designed for gaming, workstations, and data   centers.An Intel chip designed specifically for automotive use. Image   source: Intel.For Intel, autonomous vehicles are just one (potentially   significant) part of the company's Internet of Things business   (though the company did recently announce that it'd be forming an   autonomous driving group within its Internet of Things group).   NVIDIA specifically calls out automotive as a key long-term   growth segment.The reason that both companies look well-positioned to play in   the self-driving car market is because the technology that   they've developed for other markets (high-performance computing   technologies) look to be applicable to self-driving cars.   However, there is additional technical and sales/marketing work   required to succeed in self-driving cars, and both companies   appear to be making the required incremental investments to   capitalize on these opportunities.Automotive could be a bigger deal for NVIDIA than for   IntelHere's the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportunity to   make some real money from the self-driving market. Furthermore,   the market for significant computing capabilities inside of   self-driving cars could be quite substantial, especially if many   (if not most) cars over the long term are endowed with such   computing capabilities.However, I think that the self-driving car market could be   much more interesting for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel's sheer   size relative to NVIDIA.If Intel manages to grow its Internet of Things business from   about $3 billion in annual revenue to $5 billion in annual   revenue, then that'd certainly benice, but not agame changerfor Intel, which is expected to have generated more than $58   billion in revenue during 2016.However, if NVIDIA -- which has generated about $6.1 billion   in revenue over the last 12 months -- generates an incremental $2   billion in automotive-related revenue from self-driving cars over   time, then that's not only going to significantly boost the   company's top line, but its bottom line as well.Answering the titular questionAlthough I wouldn't recommend buying either Intel or NVIDIAsolelybased on the potential for self-driving cars (these are complex   businesses that generate most of their revenue from outside of   the automotive market to begin with), NVIDIA's business does   appear to be more likely to benefit from growth in self-driving   cars than Intel's because it's a smaller one to begin with.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor decades,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) was at the heart of the technology industry. As the company whose CPUs dominated the PC era, it was second to none. But Intel missed out on the mobile revolution and with PCs losing relevance every year, its leadership position has weakened. Nudging itself into Intel's place?NvidiaCorporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeSource: NVIDIANvidia started as a PC graphics card manufacturer, but now, NVDA stock is riding a wave of virtual reality gaming, artificial intelligence, deep data analysis, cloud computing and self-driving cars.As its GPU-accelerated products take over processor-intensive computing, is Nvidia set to dethrone Intel?GPUs Make the Leap From Graphics to Raw Processing PowerIn the old days of computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) played second fiddle to central processing units (CPUs).Intel's processors were literally at the heart of almost every computer sold. The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia - with a standalone GPU - were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs.It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaDesktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed - encoding video, for example, or data analysis.GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times fasterthan a CPU alone.Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose - everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers - NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power.Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUsWhy the demand for GPUs?Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be ""mined"" by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU - with its parallel number-crunching capability - was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins.Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together.Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental.Intel's new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia's latestTitan X graphics cardhas 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X's $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card's price is a steal.The technology that has the big potential for future growth involvesextremenumber crunching. Think virtual reality, the hottest trend in gaming. Cloud services - which are often a single, processor-intensive task like image recognition offloaded to the web. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining and deep data - these all require incredible processing power. Computers running INTC CPUs are too expensive and too general purpose to be running these tasks. Instead, you're more likely to find server farms powered by GPUs.NVDA has also integrated its powerful GPUs into the forefront of one of the technology holy grails: self-driving cars.Nvidia Drive PX2is the company's AI car computing platform. With two GPUs providing the horsepower, NVDA says it is capable of 34 trillion deep learning operations per second. Additional units can be run in parallel for fully autonomous driving. Nvidia has alreadypartnered with multiple high-profile automakersto equip their self-driving cars with its technology, includingBMW,VolvoandTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)Growing Importance of the GPU Reflected in NVDA StockYou can track the relative trajectories in INTC and NVDA by comparing their stock prices. Over the past five years, Intel has grown in value by a little more than 40%. That's not bad, but doesn't look quite so good when you compare it to the height of PC popularity. Since 2000, when PC sales were notching14.5% annual sales growth, Intel stock has actually dropped by 10%.3 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy Now (NVDA, ISIL, STM)In comparison, Nvidia stock is up by a whopping 650% in the past five years, and nearly 2,600% since 2000.Intel Isn't Going Anywhere, But the Age of NVIDIA Has ArrivedComputer sales continue their slow slide,down another 5.7% in 2016. Much of Intel's revenue is tied to the PC market. Nvidia is not immune to the effect of declining PC sales, either.But while INTC is trying to tie its future to technology like the Internet of Things (which is struggling with security issues and competing standards), NVDA has leveraged the massive parallel processing power of its GPUs to be a leader in multiple cutting-edge areas like AI, deep data, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles.Increasingly, it's looking like we're entering the age of Nvidia. NVDA stock reflects that reality.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20173 Things Apple Inc.

How to Think About the Race to Self-Driving Cars;1/24/2017;"Alphabet's Waymo is one of several companies inside and   outside of the traditional auto industry working to bring a   self-driving solution to market. Image source: Fiat Chrysler   Automobiles.Who will win the ""race"" to a self-driving car?makeArticleAd();That's a question that lots of investors seem to be asking.   It's not hard to understand why: Self-driving cars could   transform the way many of us get around, and transformative new   technologies tend to offer big profit opportunities for those who   are able to see them coming.Recently, a Foolish colleague asked me to come up with some   sort of metric that might help us judge the likely ""winners"" in   the race to self-driving cars, at least among the automakers. But   after some thought, I decided that it's not so simple -- and that   the idea of ""winners"" might not be the right way to think about   things when it comes to self-driving technology, at least in the   near term.Why it's hard to tell who is in the best position to profit   bigLots of companies in, around, and outside of the traditional   auto industry are working on autonomous vehicle (AV) or   ""self-driving"" technology. Some, likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) are somewhat open about where they are in the   development process and when they hope to have something on the   market.But others aren't. Among established automakers and their   suppliers, details of upcoming new products and technologies have   traditionally been held very tightly, kept secret until a few   months before launch.Take the example ofGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) , which is probably among the leaders in developing AV   technology. We know that GMacquired self-driving start-up Cruise   Automationlast year and that the new electric Chevrolet Bolt is its   ""platform"" (GM's word) fortesting AV technology.A prototype self-driving Chevrolet Bolt undergoing testing   near GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan. Image source:   General Motors.We also know that GM has been working on a   not-quite-autonomous system called ""Super Cruise"" that is   comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, and that Super Cruise has been   expected to debut as an option on a Cadillac sometime this year   (althoughthat's not certain).But we don't know when GM will bring so-called Level 4 AV   technology, a system that can provide full autonomy under some   (but not all) circumstances, to market -- or how widely GM will   roll it out, or evenhowit will roll out. Will it be an option on luxury Cadillacs, a   self-driving Bolt built specifically for ride-hailing duty, or   something else entirely? (Level 5 systems that can drive anywhere   a human driver could are thought to be much further off.)The same goes for most of the other automakers: We don't know   exactly where their technology is, how much they're spending, or   when (or how) they intend to bring it to market. Will they use an   off-the-shelf system provided by traditional industry suppliers,   or will they develop a customized, more deeply integrated   solution in-house (as GM appears to be doing)?And we certainly can't tell right now how the different   systems under development are likely to stack up -- or how the   market will receive them.We can make some broad guesses as to when Level 4 technology   will come to market, and as to who islikelyto be among the first to bring it to market. But as you'll see,   that's not necessarily helpful to us as investors: It's likely   that Level 4 technology will be a commodity not long after the   first Level 4 vehicle comes to market.Why self-driving technology will quickly become a   commodityHere's the thing that many investors seem to miss: It looks   very likely the entire incumbent auto industry will have access   to Level 4 technology before long. Giant auto supplierDelphi(NYSE: DLPH) , assisted-driving specialistMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , and chip giantIntelare working together on a Level 4 system that they promise   will be available to any automaker that wants it by the end of   2019.It will probably be another year or more after that date   before the first new cars with those systems go into production.   But at some point, likely by 2021 or so, Level 4 technology will   be a commodity: Several other companies are known to have rival   systems under development.That doesn't mean that all new cars will offer self-driving   capabilities by 2021. The systems will probably be still   expensive enough that they'll only make sense for luxury cars and   commercial vehicles (which might include vehicles built for   ride-hailing services).Winter weather poses special challenges for self-driving   systems. Image source: Ford Motor Company.They'll also be geographically limited, and they may   be limited by road conditions (think snow and ice) as well.   But the maps will expand quickly, capabilities will improve as   more cars rack up miles (and data), and the prices of the   systems' sensors and other components will drop as more are made.   Assuming that it follows the pattern set by many other new   automotive technologies over the years, Level 4 systems will   gradually become more widely available as costs drop.Long story short: Level 4 technology will probably be offered   on most new vehicles in the U.S. within a decade -- and   established auto-industry suppliers will be in a position to   supply it.Why it doesn't make sense to think in terms of ""winners""   yet""So what if,"" I asked my Foolish colleague, ""Tesla brings   a Level 4 system to market in 2019 -- but then by 2021 or so, any   automaker can buy its roughly comparable technology off the shelf   from existing industry suppliers? Does Tesla 'win'?""I think in such a scenario, Tesla would certainly win bragging   rights. That's not nothing: Bragging rights on new technology add   value to Tesla's brand in a way that they might not for a big   automaker.But Tesla is only likely to be able to make 500,000 or so cars   a year in 2019 and 2020, and that's if all goes well with itsupcoming Model 3. That's not anywhere near enough to dominate the global auto   market -- it's not really even enough to dominate the luxury-car   market in the U.S., Europe, and China. (And if the Model 3 is   anywhere near as good as Tesla fans expect, Tesla will be selling   all it can make anyway -- with or without a Level 4 system   available.)And of course the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel system will probably   have other competition by 2021, so we can't quite declare that   group to be the likely ""winner"" either, at least not yet.So where does this leave us as investors?Good question. It's one that I've been struggling to answer   for a while.Right now, the closest thing to a ""pure play"" investment in   autonomous driving (among public companies, at least) is probably   Mobileye. Mobileye is a profitable business with an enviable   client list (nearly all of the world's automakers do business   with Mobileye), But it's currently trading at over 100 times   earnings, and it's not clear that it will have the earnings   growth it will need to reward investors who buy at this   valuation.Meanwhile, an investment in a company like Delphi or GM -- orAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit --   is far from a ""pure play."" Sure, AV technology could turn out to   be a profitable business for any, but it's not likely to be   transformative (at least, not in a good way) for any of them. But   that said, it's possible (likely, really) that some companies   will come up with ways to differentiate their offerings that   allow them to win more market share or profit.Here at the Fool, we're encouraged to give our readers an   ""actionable takeaway,"" an investment idea to research or a   thought that could help you become a better investor. When it   comes to self-driving technology, my takeaway for you is this:   There are no obvious winners now, but there might be once we see   how the technology is coming to market.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 U.S.-Focused Stocks to Buy for the Trump Era;1/24/2017;"On Friday, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the U.S., an event which evoked strong reactions from both the country and the world. Promising to put ""America First,"" the president pledged to put an end to what he termed as the ""American carnage"" of rusted factories across the countries. Among his first actions on assuming office was a formal withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific trade Partnership.This is a clear indication that the President does, in fact, intend on following through on many of his campaign promises even at the cost of causing great alarm to the world at large. At this point, it does make good sense to invest in domestic focused U.S. stocks which may be ideally suited to combat any volatility investors may encounter in the days ahead.Exiting the Trans-Pacific PartnershipAlmost immediately, the President has set about fulfilling his agenda. On Monday, Trump enacted the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This was one of his key campaign promises and could create friction between the U.S. and its Asian allies. Trump has said that he wants to promote U.S. manufacturing and will now seek to conclude one to one trade deals which could be ended within a short period if necessary.This is in keeping with a feeling among several U.S. citizens that trade deals of this nature have had a detrimental effect on the U.S. job market. Trump also met with U.S. industry heavyweights at the White House on Monday, promising to implement measures which will benefit domestic production and business.At the same time, he warned that companies moving production abroad would have to face heavy penalties. Trump talked about enforcing a stiff border tax on products which come in from other countries.Encouraging Domestic IndustryTrump also told the gathering of CEOs, which included the chief executives of FordFand TeslaTSLAthat he intends to reduce U.S. corporate taxes to within 15%-20%. This is a major cut considering that the current tax level is at 35%. Additionally, such a move would require the assent of the U.S. Congress, which of course is currently Republican dominated.Meanwhile, business leaders emphasized that the need to reduce regulations was even more important in their view. Speaking to the gathering, Trump said that he believed that regulations could be reduced by 75% or more.Previously, Trump has said he is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. In fact, he has proposed $1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to goad private equity investors. Increased outlays will be aimed at improving roads, bridges and telecommunications. (Read:Welcome Trump Era with These ETFs)Our ChoicesPresident Trump has promised to bring jobs back to America, in particular those related to manufacturing. However, this may not be an easy process and certainly not a quick one. What is certain is that he has put the focus squarely back on economic activity within the country. In such an event it would a good idea to invest in sectors which are intrinsically linked to the domestic sector.In this case, stocks from the utilities, healthcare, real estate and financial services sector would be good choices. They would also make for safe options in the event of short term volatility. However, picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult.This is where ourVGM scorecomes in.

Tesla Motors, Inc.: Self-Driving Features to Launch in 3 to 6 Months;1/24/2017;"Self-driving features forTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA)  electric vehicles may come through software   updates in as little as three to six months, Musk tweeted on   Monday. Of course, these features will almost certainly still   fall short of full autonomy, but the news is interesting since it   was generally thought that it would take longer for the company's   new self-driving add-on to begin morphing into a compelling   upgrade option.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Autonomous features but not fully autonomous     drivingMusk's reference to upcoming features for itsfull   self-driving capabilityupgrade package surfaced in a response to a question about when   customers can expect the more expensive add-on to begin   meaningfully exceeding features offered in Tesla's Enhanced   Autopilot. ""3 months maybe, 6 months definitely,"" Musk   said.Alongside the introduction of its new Autopilot sensors in   October, customers buying a Tesla now have a choice between   upgrading to Enhanced Autopilot for $5,000 or paying $8,000 for   both enhanced Autopilot and what Tesla calls full self-driving   capability. But since Tesla's self-driving package won't enable   new features until the new sensors and respective software have   undergone extensive validation and regulatory approval (where   necessary), there's been little incentive to pay the additional   money for Tesla's full self-driving capability option. After all,   customers can purchase the full self-driving option after   delivery (albeit for an additional $1,000), so there's good   reason to wait if customers won't get access to any new features   by upgrading today.But apparently, it won't be too long before Tesla's full   self-driving capability evolves into a noticeable improvement   over Enhanced Autopilot.What new features may Tesla introduce?Speculating what features the company might debut for its full   self-driving capability package first, one obvious expected   feature is improved safety. On Tesla's website, the company says   vehicles with full self-driving capability will access eight   cameras instead of four. When these sensors are activated in   conjunction with automatic steering and adaptive cruise control,   safety will likely improve significantly. Indeed, when asked this   Monday whether the additional cameras will provide value before   regulatory approval for autonomous driving, Musk tweeted back,   saying, ""Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy   features, even if [regulations] disallow no driver present.""Smart Summon is a feature for Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot, but   Tesla may build on the feature's capabilities for its   self-driving upgrade option. Image source: Tesla Motors.Another potential feature to debut before regulatory approval   for autonomous driving is park seek, or the ability for your   vehicle to drop off a driver at the entrance of their destination   and then seek for a parking spot. Similarly, Tesla could   introduce improvements for its Smart Summon, which, for Tesla's   Enhanced Autopilot, promises to ""navigate more complex   environments and parking spaces, maneuvering around objects as   necessary to come find you"" when summoned out of parking spaces   and garages. Perhaps summoning enhancements for Tesla's full   self-driving capability will enable even longer distances and   even more complex environments.The speed with which Tesla hopes to begin making its full   self-driving capability noticeably better than Enhanced Autopilot   is important. It means more customers may be paying up for the   more expensive add-on sooner. And since Tesla already delivers   every vehicle with the sensors required for its full self-driving   package, more upgrades mean incremental margin for Tesla. This   incremental margin can be used to help Tesla pour back more money   into the development of Enhanced Autopilot and autonomous driving   features.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

CVX Stock: How to Trade Chevron Corporation Q4 Earnings;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEnergy giant andDow Jones Industrial AverageconstituentChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) reports earnings Friday morning. In the days leading up to the event, traders and investors alike are both asking themselves whether Chevron will trump fourth-quarter earnings expectations, or whether the corporate confessional will cause a spill in CVX stock.Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Let's take a look at recent announcements for Chevron, analyze the CVX stock chart and determine what (if anything) the options market is suggesting will come Friday.makeArticleAd();Then, we'll set up a trade to help you capture profits from the announcement.Chevron Earnings Picture and Analyst   SentimentAhead of Chevron's Friday morning Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 66 cents per share. Actual estimates encompass a very wide range from 35 cents to $1.15.The mean Street expectation implies a whopping 154% earnings growth year-over-year, as Chevron reported a mere 26 cents in profit in 2016. That result came up short of views by more than 50%. We're not holding our breath, but if Wall Street is on the money this time, the 66-cent profit would represent a sequential decline of 8.3% from Q3, which surprised by 31.5% to the upside.Revenues are estimated to grow by 26% to $36.7 billion compared to 2015's sales of $29.2 billion. Here too, range views are volatile, with a low forecast of $27.2 billion compared to a Street high of $62 billion. Sequentially, CVX's revenues are forecast to jump by 22%.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017The Wall Street community is split on Chevron stock. Eighteen rate the stock a buy, while 10 maintain hold ratings. Price targets on CVX range from a low of $95 to $145 with a median estimate of $125.50 over the year.CVX Stock Short-Term Trading RecordIf it isn't obvious yet, Chevron has established a mixed record compared to actual Street profit views. Over the past couple years, CVX has beaten forecasts 58% of the time, while missing 42%.Investor reaction has proven a bit more consistent, with gains in four of the past six announcements immediately following earnings.Working backwards, CVX stock has moved 3.91%, 0.68%, -0.21%, 0.63%, 1.10% and -4.89% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction in Chevron has produced an average gain of 0.2% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.86% based on a one standard deviation reading yields an estimated range of -2.66% to 3.06%.In other words, Chevron doesn't often move that much.CVX's seven-day performance has also allowed for a fairly benign average result, with shares falling marginally by 0.23%. However, the longer period has been accompanied by a much larger standard deviation of 5.14% and bumpier forecast range of -5.37% to 4.91%.CVX Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeShares of Chevron are in an uptrend and providing a nice, lower-risk pullback entry point. The provided weekly view shows a corrective move of nearly 49% followed by a bullish uptrend, which began back in late 2014.Currently, CVX stock is in the process of establishing a minor counter-move of several weeks. The overall shape of the pattern resembles a bullish weekly cup-and-handle.With the handle or pullback situated above the 62% retracement level and longer-term weekly moving averages, bullish traders are provided plenty of technical support. That said, these supports comprise a fairly wide price range in CVX stock.Testing of the penetrated 50% level and 50-week simple moving average near $102.50-$104 is roughly 10% to 11% below the current share price in CVX. Such a price drop wouldn't invalidate the uptrend, but the allowance for the current handle would certainly be compromised.How to Trade CVX StockThe spread between implied and underlying volatility in CVX has widened over the past month. Not only is 30-day implied volatility mostly flat, but it continues to trade in a very narrow price band - from about 15% to just above 20% over the past few months.At the same time, statistical volatility of CVX stock has fallen to around 12% and fresh two-year lows.Sell GoPro Inc Stock on This Pointless Karma     Rally (GPRO)The at-the-money 27 Jan $116 straddle market points to a 68% chance BAC will remain within an approximate price range of $113.40 to $118.60 into Friday's expiration. The math behind the calculated range is based on implied volatility of 25%, three trading sessions and shares of Chevron at $116.The purest play on the earnings event is the weekly contract. Even during quiet periods like the one CVX stock is witnessing now, those premiums reflect what traders collectively expect to happen in the stock in the immediate aftermath of earnings.The dollar move up or down works out to wiggle room of about 2.26% by Friday's close - a fairly quiet and typical event.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earnings;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is set to roll another quarterly earnings report off the assembly line this Thursday. The American automotive giant gained considerable attention during the U.S. presidential election, but that buzz has failed to carry over onto Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)In fact, judging from the sentiment backdrop, traders aren't expecting much, if anything, from Ford stock this time around.Historically, Ford has bested the Street's consensus earnings estimate in five of the past eight quarters. However, that may not mean much on Thursday, with Ford earnings expected to decline 44% to 32 cents per share from 58 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is also expected to arrive lower, down 7.2% year-over-year at $35.1 billion.And then there's Ford's whisper number. According to EarningsWhispers.com, some analysts expect earnings to fall to 34 cents per share. As you can see, expectations are quite low for F stock either way.This sentiment is also reflected in analysts data from Thomson/First Call. Currently, 17 of the 24 analysts following Ford stock rate the shares a ""hold"" or worse. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $12.83 represents a meager premium of only 4.2% to Monday's close.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017F stock options traders, however, appear considerably more optimistic. Currently, the Jan./Feb. put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.68, with calls easily outnumbering puts among options set to expire in the next month. Furthermore, this ratio plunges to 0.29 for 27 Jan. options - i.e., the most affected by this week's earnings report.The question is, are these options traders betting on a rally for F, or are they Ford stockholders looking to hedge a poor earnings performance by selling premium.Click to EnlargeIt would seem that question is answered by looking at 27 Jan implieds. Currently, options traders are pricing in a measly post-earnings move of only about 1.7%. Not only are expectations for post-earnings movement quite low, so too are F stock option premiums, decreasing the likelihood that shareholders are selling calls to offset poor stock performance.Judging from 27 Jan. implieds, the expected upper move rests at $12.46, while the lower bound lies at $12.04. Short-term support appears strong near $12, while resistance should lie closer to $13, indicating an upside potential that options markets don't seem to be pricing in.2 Trades for F StockCall Spread:I don't see any real issues in store for Ford's quarterly report, as most of the bad news is already factored into the quarter. Guidance, however, is another matter, given the unknown factor of the Donald Trump administration's protectionist plans. However, I would expect Ford to be upbeat, thus leading to an F stock rally amid low expectations.For those looking to follow the prevailing winds in the Ford options pits, a Feb $12.50/$13 bull call spread has plenty of potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $12.69, while a maximum profit of 316 cents, or $31 per pair of contracts, is possible if Ford stock closes at or above $13 when Feb. options expire.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its RangePut Sell:If a call spread is too bullish for you, then a more neutral 27 Jan $12 put sell may be what you are looking for. At last check, this option was bid at 5 cents, or $5 per contract.The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as F stock closes above $12 when 27 Jan options expire at the end of this week. The downside is that should F trade below $12 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $12 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around3 Key Blue-Chip Stocks Hogging All the ActionThe postFord Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its Range;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy any conventional measure, today is a good day to sell stock inTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). Assuming it is truly range bound,as I have written that it is, then TSLA stock is now very near the top of its range. At $245 per share, the company is valued by the market at nearly $40 billion.Source: ShutterstockCompare that to the $48 billion ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), which makes nearly 2.5 million cars per year, against fewer than 100,000 for Tesla, to get a sense of perspective.makeArticleAd();But it's certain that today's bearish call will be controversial, because Tesla stock is about more than cars.TSLA as a BrandTesla has become a lifestyle brand.You can try to tease this outof its logoor just intuit some elements of the lifestyle it represents. It represents luxury, yes. But it also represents independence, likeHoward Roarkin Ayn Rand'sThe Fountainhead -the perfect hero for the Trump era.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackThe Tesla customer won't just buy a car. He'll buy the Powerwall, and when they come out, he'll buy the solar roof as well, no matter how much they cost. He'll get a home in the desert, live off the grid, and tell the rest of the world to buzz off. Notice that all the pronouns in this paragraph are male.That's the dream, anyway. Brands are dreams as much as they're reality. Most people who buy big pick-up trucks aren't working in construction, either.The point isthere could be a lot more revenue per customerthan investors thought when TSLA stock was starting out.What else are the bulls seeing?Tesla Stock as RealityRight now, the Powerwall batterylooks to be a hitand TSLA owners are happier about their purchasers than any other car owners,by a wide margin. What the bulls are seeing is cars that get updated like smart phones, so that theylearn from crashes.They're seeing year-old carsmade brand new, their software updated rather than the hardware replaced.It's true that next year's Teslamay be radically differentfrom last year's,  running far longer on a single charge, for instance. And that chargewon't be free any more.But bulls never see the glass as even half-empty.TSLA Stock as InvestmentTesla is due to report its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 8 with analysts expecting a loss of 20 cents per share, against a loss of $1.29 per share for the same period in 2015 and revenue of $2.23 billion.We already know that TSLAmissed on its delivery targets for the quarter, shipping 22,200 vehicles. That's less than the 24,500 shipped in the third quarter, and production of 76,230 cars fell well short of the 80,000 to 90,000 target.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep     Delivering in 2017Tesla continues to operate only because it continues to get financing. Operating cash flow was positive during the third quarter, but as with that quarter's profit, it was an outlier, as TSLA stock's positive cash flow generally comes only from financing.Digging into the numbers after earnings, analysts will be expecting to find the usual mess of no income, and no operating cash flow, of operations maintained through financing. Tesla bears should know that if the fourth quarter looks like the third, they could be in for a very rough ride.Right now, Tesla stock can do no wrong, but I'm convinced that, sometime later this year, it will seem that it can do no right. People will listen tothe critics, or the company will miss on its delivery schedule (again) and TSLA stock will drop like a rock.At that point, buy it. This is not that point. If you have money in Tesla stock, take some profits off the table. If you are waiting to buy TSLA stock, let it come back to you. If you're very brave, short it.Or do what I do, watch it from afar and enjoy the ride.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

2 Trades to Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFundamentally, nothing has recently changed forTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). We still have expert opinions falling on both sides of the fence. I make my money by selling risk via Tesla options against both extreme opinions. Somewhere in the middle lies the truth.makeArticleAd();I have been a long-time critic of Tesla stock fundamentals as a car company. But I am like a lot of traders warming up to the idea that the TSLA story is not one about cars. But until this becomes consensus, car headlines will move the stock so I can't ignore that aspect of its business.Click to EnlargeTechnically, Tesla stock has made a nice recovery. This could tempt those trapped long at these levels to exit. To offset that, there could be plenty of fans looking to chase this runner. So the drop is a potential, but not a forecast.So to trade a stock that has potential, I will set a trade that gives it space to run on both sides and let time help me profit.The Trade:Sell the Tesla stock March $210/$205 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 65 cents per contract. As long as TSLA stays above $210 per share, this trade can yield 14% on money risked. This gives me a 15% buffer from current price.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaI usually like to hedge my bets. In this case, I can set a bearish side while knowing that Tesla stock fans could cause me grief on this side. The TSLA dip buyers should be enough support for the bullish trade alone. I do not rush into the hedge; I watch the price action for the next few candles.The Hedge (optional):Sell the TSLA March $290/$295 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect an additional 60 cents per contract. This trade has a 85% theoretical chance of success for a 10% yield on money risked. I could hedge this trade through earnings by sacrificing a few pennies in a debit call spread for the earnings week contract at $290.Hit the Bull's-Eye in Target Corporation (TGT) StockIf I take both credit spreads, I would be set in a sold iron condor. Since I can only lose on one side or the other, the money at risk falls. Total potential yield if Tesla stays between both spreads sold would then be 29% on money risked. This is a range-bound trade with +/-15 % buffer from current price.Cautionary note about earnings. The short-term reaction to earnings adds a temporary gambling element to trades. Wall Street often overreacts to headlines.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Motors Inc Again Proves It’s Not A Conventional Automaker (TSLA);1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsTesla Motors Inc(TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted a series of tweets on Saturday, mapping an   update schedule that is more often seen among smartphone makers   than traditional automakers.The schedule indicates that the automaker is expecting to release   majorupdatesto its vehicles every 12-18 months, according toMarketWatch.makeArticleAd();Retrofits to Slow Tesla's ProgressOlder-model cars will not be equipped with the latest sensors   or hardware, and this is worrying some Tesla owners who are   seeking upgrades to their vehicles. Musk's response to these   complaints was essentially ""tough luck.""""Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong   car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18   months. . . . If we applied resources to doing super complex   retrofits, our pace ofinnovationwould drop dramatically,"" Musk tweeted.Adding self-driving tech to earlier vehicles would require   replacing 300 parts, something that needs stripping the ""entire   car,"" he added.According to Musk, cars with HW2 technology made after October   2016 are now getting Autopilot. Musk also warned owners to be   careful while their car's cameras readjust.Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No       Matter Which Way It MovesResponding to his tweet on Sunday, Musk said the auto-steer   mode is limited to 45 mph for now, but once the company gets more   driving data, it will raise the speed.Tesla Acts More Like  a Tech CompanyBefore making any major upgrade launches, traditional   automakers usually keep the same base technology for   about five years. Tesla is known for operating more like a   tech company and less like an automaker, not to forget its   fondness of conducting beta tests and constant lineup   adjustments. This all strengthens the belief that the EV firm has   no plans of settling into the familiar patterns of its   conventional rivals, notesEngadget.However, it has both positive and negative aspects associated   with it. On one hand, it guarantees owners cutting-edgetechwhenever they buy a Tesla, while on the other hand, it means that   owners will find their cars outdated in record time.This could make owners hesitant to buy one if they suspect   they will miss out on a must-have feature, notes Engadget.Of course this means the only way for owners to keep their   vehicles the most up to date is by buying new Teslas.The postTesla Again Proves It's Not A Conventional   Automakerappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Tesla Motors, Inc.: Expect Major Improvements Every 12 to 18 Months;1/23/2017;"Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk took toTwitterthis weekend with a range of updates and commentary about the   electric-car maker's products. But perhaps the most telling of   all was a glimpse into how the company thinks about releasing   major updates for its vehicles. Here's a window into Tesla's   approach to product innovation.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Frequent updatesWhen asked on Twitter whether the company would allow owners   to pay for a retrofit of their first-generation Autopilot   hardware to Tesla's October-launched improved new sensors for   Autopilot, Musk said this won't be happening.""Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire   car and replacing 300+ parts,"" Musk explained. ""Wish there was an   easy way.""Going further, Musk said anyone buying a Tesla shouldn't   expect their vehicle to keep up with future innovation in the   company's cars.""Tesla will never stop innovating,"" Musk explained. ""People   are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major   revs every 12 to 18 months.""Customer requests for retrofits are a part of an old narrative   from Tesla owners. The first major updates for the company's   vehicles came in October 2014, when the electric-car maker   announced dual-motor all-wheel drive and the first Autopilot   hardware for its vehicles. This update introduced important   driver-assist safety features such as automatic emergency braking   and collision avoidance, as well as convenience driver-assist   features like automatic steering and parking, adaptive cruise   control, Summon (a feature that allows cars to move themselves),   and automatic parking. Furthermore, dual-motor technology   improved both the range and acceleration of Tesla vehicles.More recently, Tesla began including its second-generation   Autopilot hardware in every vehicle. The new sensors will enable   an enhanced version of Autopilot and even fully autonomous   driving, after further software validation and regulatory   approval, according to the company. In addition, in January Tesla   began offering a new version of Model S with 20 miles of   additional range than its previous highest-range model, helping   the sedan achieve a maximum driving range of 335 miles on a   single charge.For someone looking to buy the highest-range Model S, this was   a significant update since the 335-mile version cost much less   than the 315-mile version. The catch, of course, is that the   335-mile version has a zero-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds versus the   315-mile version's time of 2.5 seconds.Teslarati's Gene Liuexplainedthe significance of the new, higher-range version of Model S (and   a similar update to the company's Model X SUV lineup) when price   is taken into account:Though the increase in range on the 100D is minimal     when compared to the company's performance-based P100D with 100     kWh battery pack, the price difference is substantial. A Model     S P100D starts at a base price of $137,800 and bundles in     the Smart Air Suspension feature while the     non-performance 100D is priced considerably less at     $95,800, but does not include the Smart Air Suspension. The     $42,000 price difference buys unprecedented acceleration,     however the 100D offers 20 more miles of range than the     P100D despite the lower price point. The same story can be told     for the Model X. A Model X 100D costs $37,000 less than     the P100D version and offers 6 more miles of range.Image source: The Motley Fool.Innovation is Tesla's priorityIn short, Tesla doesn't expect its current vehicles' hardware   to keep up with new vehicles for very long. Even if that means   updating its vehicles within the same model year, Tesla intends   to deliver major revisions as fast as possible. While Tesla will   continue to deliver big software updates for vehicles it has   already delivered, the company won't be expending energy on   updating old hardware.Musk summed up this philosophy in a tweet this weekend: ""If we   applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of   innovation would drop dramatically.""This fast pace of innovation is particularly important for   Tesla. While the company's annualized 100,000-unit build rate   today has established the automaker in the luxury-car market,   Tesla's scale still pales in comparison to that of other major   automakers. As Musk has expressed in the past, speed is one of   the company's greatest defenses in combating competition.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

All of that bodes well for BofA's bottom   line.But have the shares come too far too fast? The devil, as they   say, is in the details.makeArticleAd();Unfortunately for BAC stock, there are very few details to go   on. Despite bluster about decreased regulations, Trump has   offered little in the way of actual plans for moving forward on   allowing the financial sector more leeway.What's more, despite announcing the potential for three rate   hikes in 2017, the Fed did not lift its economic growth forecast,   setting many analysts on edge. In fact, Fed Chairwoman Janet   Yellen noted that a""cloud of uncertainty"" hung over the U.S.   economyand would keep the central bank in wait-and-see mode for the time   being.Anyone else remember the Fed promising four rate hikes in   2016?Click to EnlargeTaking all this in, BAC stock's 35% rally from November through   December brings to mind a popular phrase from former Fed Chair   Alan Greenspan: ""irrational exuberance.""In fact, BAC stock has gained just 0.24% since the beginning   of the year, with the shares locked in a tight trading range   between $22 and $23.50. And that range is narrowing fast as   traders deal overbought conditions and the urge to take profits   following 2016's year-end rally amid an increasingly uncertain   geopolitical climate.As for sentiment, analysts appear content to stick with their   bullish stance for now. According to Zacks data, 14 of the 20   analysts following BAC stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better,   with no ""sell"" ratings to be found. The consensus price target,   meanwhile, rests at $24.79, indicating a premium of about 9.4% to   Friday's close.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You       BackInstead of reining in their ratings on Bank of America,   analysts decided to lift price targets over the past month to be   more inline with their bullish outlooks.  However, with BofA   stagnating throughout January, it may be only a matter of time   before this sentiment picture tops out and reverses course.As for BAC options traders, this speculative bunch is also   leaning heavily bullish on the shares.  For instance, the   February put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.64,   down sharply from even its pre-earnings perch near 0.88. That   said, there remains a lack of heavy out-of-the-money call   accumulations in the Feb. series, hinting that despite the   bullish appearance, BAC options traders may be preparing for a   reversal.Overall, February implieds are pricing in a move of about 3.2%   heading into expiration. As a result, the upper bound for the   expected move lies at $23.23, while the lower bound rests at   $21.77.2 Trades for BAC StockPut Spread:Traders looking for BAC stock to finally give in to   uncertainty and profit taking might want to consider the Feb   $21/$22 bear put spread.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: AT&T Inc.       (T), McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and Tesla Motors Inc       (TSLA)At last check, this spread was offered at 20 cents, or $20 per   pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $21.80, while a maximum   profit of 80 cents, or $80 per pair of contracts, is possible if   Bank of America shares close at or below $21 when February   options expire.Put Sell:If betting directly against BofA feels a bit premature to your   risk profile, then a more neutral-to-bearish stance may be more   appealing. Along those lines, a Feb $20 put sell should do well   in taking advantage of BAC's recent stagnation.At last check, this put was bid at 5 cents, or $5 per   contract. The upside, as usual, is that you keep the premium as   long as BAC stock closes above $20 when these options expire. The   downside is that should Bank of America trade below $20 ahead of   expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at   a cost of $20 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Short Squeeze Stocks With 10-Bagger       Potential7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's       ""America First"" PlansThe postBank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational   Exuberance Will Endappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Buy Now;1/21/2017;"Image source: Waymo.I bought a new-to-me car recently, and I realized that by the   time I'm in the market for another one, we'll likely beknee-deep into the driverless car   transformation. That's becauseIHSestimates that there will be 76 million partially to fully   autonomous vehicles on the road worldwide by 2035.That's not as far away as it may seem and this shifting   automotive market -- which will be worth $77 billion less than 20   years from now -- leaves plenty of opportunity for long-term   investors to benefit.makeArticleAd();If you're looking for top driverless car stocks that are   leading the pack, you many want to considerAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) , andTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .New name, same self-driving leadershipAlphabet's self-driving team was recentlyspun off into its own companyand now goes by the name of Waymo. To date, Waymo has   logged nearly 2 million miles of self-driving on the road and 1   billion miles of simulated driving in 2016.That makes Waymo a leader in the driverless car space, because   one of the most important aspects of letting cars drive   themselves is giving them direct experience in handling the   myriad of situations they'll encounter in the real world.And Waymo proved recently that it's much more than just an   Alphabet side project when it announced that it's developed its   own LIDAR technology that is90% cheaper than the previous systemit was using. LIDAR sends out light signals that bounce off   objects around it in order to tell self-driving vehicles what   things (cars, buildings, pedestrians, etc.) are around it.Though the new technology is much cheaper, Waymo says it's   accurate enough to tell which direction a pedestrian is looking   (which is helpful when a driverless car is trying to determine   where a person might walk).Waymo is setting itself up to benefit from the driverless car   market by selling its hardware and software as a service. Some of   the details are still unknown, but Waymo showed its hand recently   when it announced a partnership withFiat Chryslerto test self-drivng car services starting this year.Waymo's president and CEO, John Krafcik,said recentlythat the company will have its next prototypes on public roads   some time this year, further solidifying the company in the   driverless car space.Don't forget ChinaSelf-driving vehicles get a lot of attention in the U.S., but   China could end up being one of thebiggest users of driverless car tech-- and Baidu might benefit the most.The company is often called the Google of China, because it   controls everything from countries largest search engine, earns   most of its revenues from advertising, and has some of the   world's most advanced self-driving technologies as well.Baidu is already testing its technology in cities across China   and plans to release more driverless vehicles on the road next   year, with the goal of bringing mass-produced driverless cars to   market by 2021. The company benefits from China's relaxed   position on self-driving regulations and the country's need to   improve transportation its famously large cities.It's still unclear how Baidu will make money from its   driverless car pursuits, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the   company go the same route as Waymo and strike up a partnership   with an automaker to launch a self-driving service or sell its   technology directly to automakers.The carmaker playInvestors shouldn't make the mistake of overlooking Tesla's   driverless car opportunities or the huge strides the company's   already taken. Tesla began adding all of the necessary hardware   to make all its vehicles fully autonomous just a few months ago,   something no other carmaker is even close to doing.All of the hardware isn't turned on right now, but it'll use   the technology to collect driving data to improve its   semi-autonomous software. When enough information has been   collected in real-word situations, Tesla will then offer owners   the option toactivate the hardware.Tesla also recently posted a video of its semi-autonomous   Autopilot technology driving a person around town in the fog   while navigating intersections, pedestrians, traffic, and even   bicyclists. Tesla has already talked about plans to let its   owners rent out their vehicles to others when they are not   utilizing it, and CEO Elon Musk says the time frame for fully   autonomous Teslas could happen by the end of this year.In a move that further proves the company's commitment to   self-driivng technology, Tesla recently announced that it'll be   using technology from another driverless car tech leader,NVIDIA Corporation's(NASDAQ: NVDA) . Tesla will use NVIDIA's supercomputer in its   new cars to help them process all the visual information   collected and give the vehicles optimal image recognition   capabilities through NVIDIA's GPUs.There's no going back nowWhile driverless cars may still seem like a long way off,   automakers are continually adding incremental self-driving tech   to their vehicles and the U.S. government is providing new   opportunities (and much-needed rules) for making these   technologies a reality. Investors looking for a new technological   shift to bet on should look no further than driverless cars --   and consider any of the companies listed above.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla Needs To Be Cautious In China;1/20/2017;"Recently, Tesla Motors (TSLA)announcedthat its new car owners in China will no longer enjoy free supercharging for the life of the vehicle. This is in line with its global policy and does not impact existing owners who ordered their cars before January 15th. However, consumers in China are critical of this policy and have started doubting Tesla's other promises. The company faces tough competition in the region with local companies building cheaper electric vehicles. AChinese start up NextEValready claims to have built the world's fastest electric vehicle, which is likely to be cheaper than Tesla's Model 3.  The Chinese branded electric-vehicles market is supported by huge government subsidies as China looks to build global leadership in clean energy. The Chinese government has a target of5 millionelectric vehicles to ply on the country's roads by 2020 and is subsidizing local players to achieve large scale production. However, these local vehicles do not offer the luxury and long range of Tesla and are likely to gain market share on their lower costs. With China on track to become the largest electric vehicles market in the world, several players are looking to enter this market with a wide range of offerings creating a stiff competitive environment for Tesla. Audi announced recently that it would introduce five new electric vehicles in the country over the next five years. General Motors' Chinese joint venture is investing $ 3.8 billion in electrification and developing 10 'new energy' models by 2020. And the Indian company Mahindra is looking for a joint venture in China to manufacture and sell electric vehicles in the region.See our full analysis for Tesla MotorsChinese customers are not ""automatic"" fans of Tesla and might look for other luxury and value-based electric alternatives. Tesla's change in this life-of-car charging policy is likely to impact value-seeking customers more, given that they are price sensitive to begin with. Tesla's Model X, which is its ""mass scale"" electric vehicle, is more likely to be impacted by the change in its ""free charging for a life time"" policy and wider availability of other cheaper brands. Tesla's charging rate is a ""guide"" rate which can be increased in future. Any increase in this rate can irk Chinese customers since they are averse to price increases.makeArticleAd();So far, Tesla has had a good innings in China. Its Model 3 reservations in China were higher than any other country in the world, other than the U.S.  and the company is considering construction of an assembly factory in the region. While this is a strong indicator of the company's growth potential in the region, it needs to tread carefully in China. Players across the globe are looking to capture the Chinese EV (i.e., electric vehicle) market and competition especially for the low priced Model 3 is likely to get tougher. According to our estimates, Tesla's Model 3 (Gen III) is the most important segment of its business accounting for nearly 50% of its valuation. We expect Gen III to capture a 20% market share in the global EV market by the end of our forecast period.While the electric vehicles market is still at a nascent stage, China is the most important region for players in this segment. With government subsidies and high demand for EVs, several players are looking to establish themselves in the region. Tesla is likely to be a key player in this market with its luxury offerings, long range and wide network of supercharging stations. However the company needs to be cautious of the Chinese sentiment as it looks to grow further in the region.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock   Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;1/20/2017;"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.makeArticleAd();Lower Corporate TaxesTrump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.“Repeal and Replace”The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scale Back Dodd-FrankCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again."

Why Boring AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Can Work For (Or Against) You;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips""Boring is good"" forAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), according to InvestorPlace writer and IPO Playbook Editor Tom Taulli, and for whatever it's worth, I mostly agree. But really, what choice do I have? AT&T as a corporate entity has existed for over 50 years above the average American lifespan. This isn't Elon Musk andTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). And I highly doubt that there are T stock fan boys trolling the internet to defend the honor of AT&T.Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrMaybe that's a bit of a low blow. T stock isn't irrelevant by any means. In fact, AT&T scored the biggest ""T"" of our media ecosystem - as in Taylor Swift.makeArticleAd();I don't need to haul in loads of statistics for you to understand the marketing power behind the company's ""Taylor Swift Now"" experience. Just by name recognition, AT&T can piggyback off the social media and pop culture phenomenon.But will this and other deals translate to profitability for T stock investors? The initial signs don't look too hot. Presently, AT&T stock is just a few cents higher than when ""Taylor Swift Now"" launched. At one point, T was up 4% generated by the enthusiasm.Why Investors Love T stockAt the same time, T stock just gave investors a 30% return last year. Obviously, they're doing something right. It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge and credit the successes of AT&T.First, the venerable company is making some savvy moves. The most conspicuous of these is the acquisition ofTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). Although this deal has its own set of inherent risks - we are talking about media and entertainment, after all - AT&T is loaded with money. More importantly from an administrative perspective, itsfree cash flowis indeed free and flowing. If anybody can absorb the risk, it's T stock.10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's     ""America First"" PlansThen there's the exciting details written in the fine print. The company has revamped its acquisition of DirecTV with standard-bearing streaming services. Also, the introductory rate for new DirecTV customers is $35 a month, which then moves up to a still agreeable $60 regular rate. Best of all, the platform is well-integrated with others, includingApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV andAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV.If initial reports are anything to go by, T has a big winner on its hands. There's good reason to believe that the late winter rally of AT&T stock was primarily attributed to DirecTV's popularity.Of course, anyone that has had their eye on T stock knows that the AT&T dividend is a huge draw. With a 4.7% yield, that is very difficult to ignore. This is all the more true considering that high rates of passive income typically carries significant capital risk. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty certain that this company isn't going anywhere any time soon. Furthermore, the payout on the AT&T dividend has steadily increased over the last 32 years.Is the Relationship With AT&T Getting Old?So why on earth would anyone cast doubt on T stock? The problem for me is that AT&T is in the maintenance business. As Taulli notes, the company has ""79.4 million business wireless subscribers, 53.9 million consumer wireless subscribers and 25.3 million video subscribers. More importantly, AT&T has the benefit of a powerful moat - that is, a nationwide fiber optic network. Replicating this would be incredibly expensive."" Although impressive, there's not much more that T can do in that department besides annexing Canada.This is a point of heated contention, but it's definitely worth mentioning - traditional media is dying.Naturally, I'm leery of organizations and investments like AT&T stock, where salvation comes from a steadily archaic industry. And here's another scary thought: According toInc, a majority of millennialsdon't even watchtelevision.Don't Sweat Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock --     Here's WhyThis leads to a disconcerting theory. Maybe it's not that T stock is irrelevant; rather, it's their core business that is losing influence. If AT&T's investments are focused on chasing yesterday's trends, that might be a hindrance when tomorrow comes around.At the end of the day, none of this matters depending on your personal perspective. If you're looking for growth and have the time frame to take on heavier risks, avoid T stock. It just doesn't have the speculative potential that's necessary to reliably produce great gains. In addition, the AT&T dividend isn't that big of a deal unless you're putting serious capital to work.Which then brings T stock to where it most belongs - in a conservative retirement portfolio. For that purpose, there aren't that many superior candidates. It's boring as heck, with a little bit of spice to not have you go comatose.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second     Wind7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postWhy Boring AT&T Inc.

Should You Take the Wheel in General Motors Company (GM) or Ford Motor Company (F)?;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI remember stopping at a roadside gas station in Arkansas as a child and seeing a bumper sticker that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway holding a Ford steering wheel than drive a Chevy."" Of course, immediately next to this sticker was an almost identical one that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway holding a Chevy steering wheel than drive a Ford."" While my eight-year-old mind found both stickers to be hilarious and somehow profound, I wasn't sure - as the owners of a Pontiac - where my family stood in this pecking order.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)I try to be a little less tribal when it comes to investing. I'm comfortable owning bothGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) stock if the prices are compelling enough. (And in fact, I do own both GM stock and F stock in my Dividend Growth portfolio.) But today, we're going to do a good, old-fashioned Ford vs GM stock smack down.GM Vs. F: ValuationI'll start first with valuation. The entire auto sector looks cheap right now, and General Motors and Ford are certainly not exceptions.At current prices, GM stock trades for a ridiculous 4.3 times trailing earnings and 6.1 times forward earnings estimates. F stock isn't exactly expensive, mind you, trading at trailing and forward earnings multiples of 5.9 and 7.6, respectively. But GM is the cheaper stock based on earnings.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeLooking at the price/sales ratio, which eliminates some of the accounting issues that can make direct comparisons difficult, it's essentially a wash. General Motors and Ford trade for 0.35 and 0.32 times their respective annual sales.So, in a world in which few stocks can credibly be called ""cheap,"" GM stock and F stock are clearly exceptions. At these prices, investors are essentially pricing in years of earnings stagnation or outright shrinkage. And hey, automakers obviously have less growth potential today than they did a generation ago, particularly with ride sharing rising in popularity and the concept of a car as a service rather than an asset is starting to take shape. And the strong sales of recent years will probably take a breather. But at 4 to 6 times earnings, it's hard to argue the bad news wasn't priced in a long time ago.Winner:General MotorsGM Vs. F: DividendNext, let's consider the dividends. At current prices, General Motors and Ford sport dividend yields of 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively, making both high yielders by the standards of today's market. So F stock looks ever so slightly more appealing based on the raw yield.Of course, there is more to a dividend than just its current yield. There is also the issue of growth. Since reinstating its dividend in 2014, General Motors has already raised it 27%. Over that same period, Ford has raised its regular dividend by a smaller 20% but also paid two special dividends that collectively equal a full two quarters' worth of regular dividends at the current rate. So when it comes to dividends, Ford is the clear winner here.Winner:FordGM Vs. F: Future ProofingI'm going to skip the usual banter about whether the Chevy Silverado or the Ford F-150 sells more trucks next quarter. No, instead we're going to focus on which one of these old-economy companies is doing a better job of preparing for the future.I'll start with General Motors. GM is looking to compete head on with the likes of electric car leaderTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) with the Chevy Bolt. Now, Tesla clearly wins that contest based on both style and performance, but the Bolt is no slouch. For drivers wanting to move beyond the internal combustion engine, the Bolt is a viable option.But even bigger in my mind are GM's embrace of both ride sharing and autonomous self-driving cars via its partnerships with bothLyftandUber. Last year, GM inked deals with both ride sharing companies to profit from the transformation of car transportation from a personal asset to a pay-as-you-go service.Rather that bury their heads in the sand, GM's leaders are embracing this trend. And GM's partnership with Lyft will ideally create the infrastructure to make self-driving cars a practical reality for the masses.Short Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's OverhypedFord is making its own efforts, of course, with a goal of creating its own fleet of self-driving cars by 2021. Ford also has an electric version of the Focus. But all in all, GM seems to be doing a slightly better job of embracing the future. We're still early in the game, and a lot can happen. But for now, I'm giving the nod to General Motors.Winner:General MotorsThis gives GM the slight edge overall. Of course, no one ever said you have to choose just one.

Will Solar Manufacturing Be a Costly Mistake for Tesla?;1/20/2017;"When it bought SolarCity late in 2016,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) may have taken on a manufacturing challenge that   makes automobiles look easy. The solar industry has left a string   of bankrupt manufacturers over the past decade, and a price drop   of over 30% in 2016 alone could be a sign that more revenue   pressure is ahead.Amid this backdrop, Tesla is trying to make new technology   work at scale, is bringing in a new partner, and is launching the   solar roof. That's a lot to take on all at once, and it could be   more than even Tesla can handle.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Tesla's manufacturing plans are complicated, at     bestSolarCity was in the process of building out manufacturing   capacity using technology it acquired from Silevo when it was   acquired by Tesla. The acquisition meant bringingPanasonic, Tesla's battery partner, and its HIT technology into   SolarCity's plant.Panasonic's technology has similarities to Silevo, but is   different enough that they're not a natural fit. There's also the   small complication that Silevo uses a 156 mm cell and Panasonic   uses a 126 mm cell. In other words, bringing SolarCity, Silevo,   and Panasonic technology under one roof is far from a trivial   task.It's unclear how much equipment was installed before the Tesla   acquisition, but there's certainly some Silevo technology in   SolarCity's Buffalo facility. In its research,PV Techalso cited job postings that included language about Silevo   technology as evidence that Panasonic won't be the sole   technology in the plant.We also know that Tesla will be making solar roof cells and   shingles in the Buffalo plant. In other words, Tesla will need to   manufacture three separate products in the facility.Solar manufacturing is hardMaking one solar product cost competitive is hard enough. But   Tesla is now trying to make three products simultaneously, and is   facing a solar industry that currently is under pricing pressure.   The price of solar panels fell over 30% in 2016, and prices are   now around $0.40 per watt for commodity solar panels, which, not   coincidentally, is what SolarCity is still installing as it ramps   up solar manufacturing.Neither Tesla or SolarCity has given any information about   what efficiency or costs look like coming out of in-house   manufacturing to this point. But given delays in launching solar   panels and the fact that Panasonic had to be brought in as a   partner, we can discern that it isn't going well.The financial impact could be big if manufacturing fails. New   York was nice enough tobuild the $750 million plant and buy equipment   for it, but that came with a commitment to spend $5 billion in the   state over the next decade, including hiring 1,460 high-tech   workers. And SolarCity estimated it would still spend around $150   million in capital costs at the plant, plus cost overruns. If   SolarCity, and now Tesla, fails to meet obligations for   investment and job creation in New York it could be obligated to   pay $41.2 million per year as a ""program payment"". If panels   aren't competitive, it's safe to say the impact on Tesla could   measured in the hundreds of millions in losses.Why Tesla doesn't need solar manufacturing in the first     placeAt the same time that Tesla is trying to complete   manufacturing plants to make three products, competitors are   improving technology and lowering costs. On top of the already   low and declining costs for commodity panels, many   manufacturers are building out mono-PERC high-efficiency   manufacturing capacity. Mono-PERC technology that's being built   out is comparable in efficiency to what Panasonic was producing,   so Buffalo may not have much, or any, efficiency advantage over   competitors.In other words, Tesla could be buying solar panels in the open   market that would be similar to what the Buffalo plant would   make. No headaches, no risk, no promises to invest in   manufacturing capacity that may not be cost competitive at   scale.It looks like getting into solar manufacturing was an   unnecessary risk for SolarCity, and now it's a problem for Tesla.   Investors should hope it's not a distraction that becomes a   financial drain, something the company doesn't need right   now.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Short Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock While It’s Overhyped;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsShares ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) rose over 2% yesterday on the heels of an upgrade by Morgan   Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. TSLA stock also broke out past   some major resistance at the $235 level as well.While Tesla bulls are rejoicing for now, however, the party   should be short-lived, if history is any guide. To me, it's time   to take a (guarded) short stance in Tesla stock.makeArticleAd();While one can debate the valuation of Tesla stock and the   aggressive sales projections of the all-important Model 3, the   fact remains that buying TSLA stock at current levels requires ahugeleap of faith. Some may even consider it blind faith, especially   as the market cap approaches $40 billion and price-to-sales still   exceeds 6.From a technical perspective, Tesla shares are becoming   extremely overbought. Previous instances when shares were at   comparable overbought readings were indicative of significant   intermediate-term tops in TSLA.Click to EnlargeTesla did break out past some significant resistance at the   critical $235 level. While this may serve the bullish thesis well   for the short-term, it also provides the potential for a quick   and sharp reversal if that level fails to hold. Given that TSLA   shares are up over 30% since bottoming at $180 in early December,   a significant pullback would not be a surprise.Click to EnlargeMuch of the recent rally may be attributed to short covering,   as short interest continued to climb while the rally began in   earnest. But the shorts have been severely punished, so that   tailwind is diminished.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeAlso interesting to note that Morgan Stanley is a lead   underwriter on both the secondary stock issuance and convertible   bond issuance for Tesla.Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla stockprior to the last two times Tesla issued more stock and   convertible bonds. Kinda makes me wonder.Given the magnitude of the recent rally and the grossly   overbought levels of TSLA stock, I think a counter-trend put   calendar play makes sense. While the $235 support may hold in the   short-term, I think it eventually will give way to a sharp   reversal once the faith is broken.How to Trade TSLA Stock HereBuy Feb $235 puts and sell 27 Jan $235 puts for a $5 net     debit.The trade is 14 deltas short at inception with a maximum risk   of $500 per spread. Ideally, TSLA stock pulls back towards the   $235 level over the coming week.The short strike expires before earnings due on Feb. 8.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.

Everything Is Coming Up Roses for UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) Stock;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnitedHealth Group Inc(NYSE:UNH), a Minnesota-headquartered health insurer recently released its fiscal year 2016 numbers. And they were impressive.Source:bradleypjohnson via FlickrGiven the fact that the industry has been racking up huge losses trying to sort out how to make money from Obamacare, no one was really expecting a company like UNH to increase revenues 17.6% year over year. Earnings per share were up 25%, as were non-GAAP EPS.makeArticleAd();That certainly doesn't sound like a company that's struggling to find a way through the current healthcare mess. The stock is up over 40% in the past 12 months, so it doesn't look like UNH is falling victim to confused system.While UNH lost 135,000 people in individual plans (mostly Obamacare plans) in Q4, it finished the year up 160,000 individuals. Its corporate plans saw an increase for the year of 205,000.And under a Republican controlled Congress, things should become even better for UNH. However, there will be a transition for UnitedHealth Group if the new version of Obamacare is significantly different from what has been built over the past several years.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     RetirementBut that isn't a big issue, since all companies in the sector will have to deal with that equally.Long term, growth is built in on a number of levels. And the biggest of those is the massive numbers of baby boomers who are going to be retiring over the next decade.Researchers have even dubbed the upcoming transition the '2030 problem' because that is when most of the 75 million baby boomers will be between the ages of 66 and 84. That breaks down to about 3 million boomers entering retirement age every year for the next two decades.This is an entire new industry that has not existed before and means those insurers that can best adapt and maximize revenue from this megatrend, the better they will do.And UNH should do just fine.It is a major player in Medicaid and Medicare, so if more weight is put on that system as Congress renovates Obamacare, UNH is there. It has integrated business to help individuals, businesses, governments as well the healthcare providers themselves in everything from billing to prescriptions to quality of care.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Gets a     Meaningless UpgradeAnd now, it's strengthening its outpatient (aka, ambulatory care) services. Last week UNH announced its purchase ofSurgical Care Affiliates Inc(NASDAQ:SCAI) for $2.3 billion. SCAI has more than 200 outpatient surgical centers in 35 states and does nearly 1 million surgeries a year.This will be another area of strong growth for the next two decades or more.

NHTSA Drops Tesla Autopilot Investigation, Highlights Technology Strengths;1/19/2017;"In June, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety   Administration had opened a preliminary evaluation into   Autopilot's performance in an unfortunate fatal accident that   occurred while the technology was activated. About seven months   later, NHTSA says it is closing the investigation after   concluding that it did not identify any defects.But NHTSA went further than ending the investigation. NHTSA's   report on the analysis also highlighted some strengths of the   technology.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla Motors.Closing the investigationAfter NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) analyzed   Autopilot's systems, NHTSA concluded both that it didn't find any   defects in the technology and that it didn't find ""any incidents   in which the systems did not perform as designed.""""At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and we   appreciate the thoroughness of NHTSA's report and its   conclusion,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement on   Thursday.NHTSA's conclusion about Tesla's automatic emergency braking   (AEB) system is of particular interest given the nature of the   fatal crash, which consisted of the Autopilot-engaged Tesla   driving on a divided highway and subsequently colliding with a   tractor trailer driving across the highway perpendicular to the   Model S. However, NHTSA said AEB systems aren't designed to   operate in situations like this.ODI's analysis of Tesla's AEB system finds that 1) the     system is designed to avoid or mitigate read-end collisions; 2)     the system's capabilities are in-line with industry state of     the art for AEB performance through MY 2016; and 3) braking for     crossing path collisions, such as that present in the Florida     fatal crash, are outside the expected performance capabilities     of the system.Further, NHTSA emphasized that Tesla's system explicitly   ""requires the continual and full attention of the driver to   monitor the traffic environment and be prepared to take action to   avoid crashes."" Suggesting the driver was inattentive, NHTSA's   investigation found the driver had ""at least seven seconds"" to   notice the tractor trailer.Interesting takeaways from the reportIn addition to exonerating Tesla, the report pointed to some   other notable tidbits about the technology and its   development.1. Tesla was proactive about considering inattentive   drivers in Autopilot's development.NHTSA found that ""it appears that over the course of researching   and developing Autopilot, Tesla considered the possibility that   drivers could misuse the system in a variety of ways,"" and that   ""the potential for driver misuse was evaluated as part of Tesla's   design process and solutions were tested, validated, and   incorporated into the wide release of the product.""2. The crash rate for Tesla Autopilot-equipped vehicles   dropped about 40% compared to vehicles without the   technology, according to NHTSA's analysis of mileage and airbag deployment   for Tesla vehicles.Tesla Model S and 2016 Model X vehicles before and after   Autosteer installation. Chart source: NHTSA.Pointing to this particular data point from the report, Tesla   CEO Elon Musk tweeted Thursday, saying the company is targeting a   90% reduction in crashes for vehicles with the updated Autopilot   hardware Tesla started including in every vehicle in October.3. Tesla could have been more transparent about system     limitations, but its warnings are more explicit now.Tesla's information about system limitations of Autopilot is   ""perhaps not as specific as it could be,"" the report said. But   information, particularly as it relates to user interface   warnings, alerts, and driver monitoring systems intended to   ensure the driver remains attentive, improved significantly in   Tesla's 8.0 software update, which NHTSA highlights:Tesla's design included a hands-on the steering wheel system     for monitoring driver engagement. That system has been updated     to further reinforce the need for driver engagement through a     ""strike out"" strategy. Drivers that do not respond to visual     cues in the driver monitoring system alerts may ""strike out""     and lose Autopilot function for the remainder of the drive     cycle.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its new Autopilot   hardware. Image source: Tesla Motors.NHTSA's conclusion about the fatal crash is good news for   Tesla investors. Not only does it emphasize how the company's   Autopilot technology works as it's intended, but it also points   to improving safety because of the technology. And with Tesla's   new hardware being far more capable than the first-generation   Autopilot hardware examined in this report, the safety of Tesla's   vehicles should only improve.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/19/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock got clocked to end 2016. Shares tumbled from as high as $70 to just $28 today, a crushing 60% decline. Is TWLO stock finally cheap enough today, or is there room for even more downside?Source:Web Summit Via FlickrOn the plus side, numerous analysts are upgrading the firm as the price drops. And a new partnership could reinvigorate the growth story.makeArticleAd();But don't overlook the risks here either. Just because a stock has fallen a long way already doesn't mean it can't keep dropping. Before you hit the ""buy"" or ""sell"" button on TWLO stock, however, take a minute to consider both sides of the coin.TWLO Stock ConsTwilio Doesn't Have a Moat:Twilio has generated a lot of interest in its services due to affordable pricing. The company is operating with a negative 15% net profit margin. And this figure has hardly budged over the past year, even as revenue has soared. You would expect to see scale effects by this point. One alternative hypothesis is that Twilio has underpriced its services. It doesn't appear to have a genuine technological moat. Much of what the company does would probably not require excessive effort for its customers to do internally. A company such asFacebook Inc(NYSE:FB) always has the option of building their own message marketing platform. But why bother if Twilio is willing to provide the service at less than cost? However, that sentiment could change quickly the moment Twilio tries to raise prices.Valuation Still an Issue:One of the issues with low-float IPOs such as Twilio is that the stocks can run far beyond seemingly logical valuations. TWLO stock soared out of the gate, but this was likely mostly due to the limited number of publicly trading shares. Insiders still controlled the vast majority of the company. They've been slowly selling more of the stock into the market, depressing the price. However, given that initial pop to $70, many investors have a mental anchor there. They see a drop from $70 to $28 and think it must be cheap now. However, compare Twilio with other firms in its space. Its 9x EV/sales figure is still astoundingly high, and is in fact the highest in its entire peer group. The company's revenue growth rate is slowing down enough to make it difficult to justify paying up for Twilio's expensive revenues.10 Companies That Should Be in the Dow     JonesPositive News, But Stock Isn't Moving:The poor performance TWLO stock has delivered lately demonstrates the valuation issues. The company has gotten a stream of upgrades along with the announcement of a potentially game-changing partnership withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). More on this below. Despite all the good news, TWLO stock hasn't gone anywhere. After each bit of positive news or analyst upgrade, the stock pops for a day or two and then gives back all the gains. This is indicative of an overpriced stock. Owners are happy to use any pop to sell, while short sellers show no nervousness.TWLO Stock ProsNewsflow Turning Positive:In recent weeks, TWLO stock has seen many positive news announcements. In late December, Drexel Hamilton started the company with a ""buy"" opinion. Pacific Crest Securities upgraded the firm to start 2017. And just this week, two more firms weighed in, with Canaccord Genuity upgrading it to a ""buy,"" and Oppenheimer naming TWLO stock a 2017 top pick. If that weren't enough, in late December, Twilioformed an expanded partnershipwith Amazon. Amazon Web Services had already partnered with Twilio to deliver text messages for AWS customers. Now that capability will be expanded to include voice messaging, greatly expanding Twilio's reach within the booming AWS ecosystem.Short Squeeze Potential:Normally, you see short sellers pile into a stock as it soars. However, that's not always the case; sometimes short sellers pile onto a plunging stock. That's exactly what they've done with TWLO stock. As TWLO stock peaked in late September, short interest was just 64% of the float. That's a huge number, yes, but it was about to get bigger. In November, short interest topped 100% of the float (a very rare occurrence). By the end of November, short interest hit 116% of the float, suggesting that for every 5 tradable shares of TWLO stock, 6 had been sold short. This is rather sketchy, as generally exchange regulations prohibit this sort of behavior. Even with the continued weakness in Twilio stock, short interest has hardly budged - the most recent data has it at 8.8 million shares, or 102% of the float. Needless to say, any concentrated effort by these short sellers to dispose of their positions could set off a large rally in the stock.Earnings Soon:TWLO stock needs something to reset the narrative. Over the past month, Twilio has seen a variety of positive developments, centered around the upgraded partnership with Amazon and numerous stock upgrades. However, traders are still focused on insider selling and the company's high valuation level. At this point, earnings in a couple of weeks could be the catalyst that finally revives the bull case. Twilio is trading not far off IPO levels now, it'd take some gumption for the shorts to press the stock through that level. On the other hand, given the massive short interest, even a modest beat could send the stock flying. Remember that Twilio initially traded down on earnings last quarter, but buyers appeared shortly thereafter.Bottom Line on TWLO StockTraders have punished TWLO stock over the past quarter. There are certainly reasons to expect the stock could turn around. Short interest is astoundingly high and persistent.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Gets a     Meaningless UpgradeThe stock has seen more positive news lately, and earnings could be the mechanism that finally triggers a sentiment shift. However, the company still appears richly priced. And it's not entirely clear that Twilio will ever be able to ramp to any significant level of profitability. For now, this is a better trade than an investment.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek had no positions in   any of the aforementioned stocks.

Tesla Motors Upgraded: 3 Things You Need to Know;1/19/2017;"It's been nearly two months sinceTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) finalized its acquisition of SolarCity, unifying   two of alternative energy's leading lights under Elon Musk's   leadership --and Wall Street hates them both.According to data from ratings aggregatorStreetInsider.com, the past six or so months have seenTesla stockbombarded with negative sentiment -- a brand-new sell rating   (from Cowen), two downgrades (Argus and Goldman Sachs), and two   underwhelming initiations of coverage at ""hold"" (from Deutsche   Bank and Berenberg). But finally, at long last, someone had   something nice to say about Tesla today.makeArticleAd();Morgan Stanley just upgraded the stock. Here are three things   you need to know about that.Tesla's Model 3 electric sedan could hit big -- and mean big   things for Tesla stock. Image source:Tesla.1. Why Morgan Stanley loves TeslaIn a long, drawn-out sketch of Tesla's several moving parts,   Morgan Stanley hit upon three key reasons it thinks investors   should own the stock. These include:The impending launch of theModel 3 mass market electric sedan, which Morgan Stanley now sees arriving sooner than it had     feared, and delivering ""a significant positive impact     on earnings and our price target.""Decreased competition from Silicon Valley rivals, with     ""tech firms"" such asGoogleandAppleno longer seeming as interested as they once were in producing     whole branded electric cars on their own. Morgan thinks they're     now more inclined to just build bits and pieces of software     that Detroit can then insert into the cars that it builds (and     presumably, Morgan Stanley sees Detroit as easier than Silicon     Valley for Tesla to beat).And generally speaking, Morgan believes that America is     ""moving Tesla's way"" in its willingness to adopt electric cars     over gasoline-powered horseless carriages. According to the     analyst, Tesla ""stands at the epicenter of US high tech     manufacturing job creation,"" and will benefit     disproportionately as this industry evolves.Put it all together, and Morgan Stanley is convinced Tesla   stock will outperform the market, and assigns the stock a $305   price target -- 25% more than what the stock costs today.2. Summing up those partsThat's the big picture. Now here are a few specifics.In working up its valuation on Tesla stock, Morgan Stanley   specifically excludes, and assigns ""zero value"" to Tesla's   ""Energy"" battery business. Instead, Morgan gets the its basic   target price from valuing (a) how many cars Tesla is likely to   produce, and subtracting from that value (b) the number of cars   Teslafailed to produce as promisedlast year, and (c) the cost of ""higher capex"" as Tesla builds its   business.Working these numbers, Morgan arrives at a base value for   Tesla of $229 per share, which Morgan Stanley admits is ""slightly   below the current share price.""3. Tesla's X-factorSo how does Morgan move from $229 to $305 on its target price?   This is the third part of the equation, and it may surprise you.   The company assigns fully $76 in share price to the value of   Tesla's proposedTesla Mobilitycar-sharing service -- which doesn't actually exist yet.Its non-existence notwithstanding, Morgan boldly proclaims   that ""over 100% of the upside to our $305 price target can be   attributed to the value we ascribe to Tesla Mobility."" And   adding $76 to $229, the company finds the entire company to be   worth 25% more than it costs today.That's a big leap of faith that Morgan Stanley is making,   granted. But it's worth noting that the analyst has actually   ratcheted back its expectations. As the Fool's own Alex Dumortier   has noted previously, in 2015, Morgan Stanley said Tesla Mobilitycould be worth $244 a shareto Tesla. And ifthatprediction turns out to be true, then the stock could literally   double from today's $244 share price.Bonus thing: How much is a Model 3 worth?Granted, much of the above remains speculation -- the zero   value of Tesla's nascent battery business, and the incredible   value of the car-sharing business that has yet to begin   operations. Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to prove it can earn a   profit fromanyof its businesses over the course of a full financial year. For   the time being, the stock is still being valued largely on the   volume of cars it produces, regardless of the profits that they   do or do not produce.And this brings us to the final valuable tidbit of information   contained in Morgan Stanley's report. According to the analyst,   $81 of its $305 price target comes from Morgan Stanley's belief   that Tesla will deliver 75,000 ""additional"" Model 3s in 2018, and   ""nearly 100,000 units"" in 2020. If you crunch those numbers,   therefore, it appears that Morgan Stanley is valuing each 1,000   cars sold in 2018 at about $0.50 in added share value for Tesla   stock (75 x $0.50 = $37.50 per share), and valuing each 1,000   cars sold two years later at about $0.435 per 1,000 units (100 x   $0.435 = $43.50 per share).Knowing this may give you an idea of what to expect in future   upgrades (and downgrades) from Morgan Stanley, as Tesla delivers   (and fails to deliver) on its car delivery promises. Simply put,   for every 1,000 units that Elon Musk promises to investors, add   $0.435 to the stock price -- and for every 1,000 cars that Tesla   actuallydelivers, you can mark up the value of Tesla stock by $0.50.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 Bullish Trades to Juice Your Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Position;1/19/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate 2016, I wrote how to catch theFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) knife. The trade was pure profits out of thin air. Since then, Facebook stock caught a 13% rally, but it still isn't expensive. Let's trade it again.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, FB execution has been flawless. It had doubters, but management proved them all wrong. After all, it would take a major gaffe to ruin the potential of a billion users.Technically, while this is not an obvious short-term entry point, it should be a good point for a long-term trade. I am not looking to profit from this trade in the next few days. Instead, I am looking out to next year.The Ultra-Cheap Portfolio: 3 Schwab ETFs for 2017The Trade:Sell the FB Jan 2018 $100 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $4.50 per contract to open. To be successful, I need Facebook stock to stay above my sold strike while I hold the position open. Selling naked puts is risky and I only do it if I am willing and able to own FB stock at the strike sold. My breakeven price would be the strike price less the premium I collect. In this case, breakeven is $96 per share. If FB stock falls below my strike I could get assigned the stock. This means that I would own FB at a 21% discount from current levels. I also keep the premium I collect to open the trade. If I really want to juice this bullish trade, I can add a debit call setup for an even more bullish bias.The Juice (optional):Buy the FB June $130/$135 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $2 per contract to open. I stand to double my money if FB rallies past my spread. Since we are in earnings season, I could delay entry in the debit call spread or keep it a small bet. Short-term reactions to earnings add a temporary gambling element. We never know how will traders react to the earnings regardless of how good they are. Usually those reactions, if unwarranted, are short-lived and the stock should resume its pre-earnings trajectory.The Hedge(optional):Usually I like to sell credit call spreads to hedge my bet. In this case I am opting out. Instead of hedging, I can be less bullish by taking only one of the two trades suggested. Selling credit call spreads in this ""animal spirit"" market seems counterintuitive. The bulls are in complete control for now.The Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in 2017I am not required to hold options trades open until expiration.

Revenues also came in over the bar, tallying $2.48 billion versus   an expectation for $2.47 billion.But what really excited investors and analysts alike Wednesday   night: subscriber totals.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for       RetirementNetflix had forecast 5.2 million total subscriber additions   for the quarter, but instead brought in more than 7 million. That   was bolstered by a huge push on the international front, adding   5.1 million subscribers outside of the U.S. That said, domestic   subscriber additions of 1.93 million were better than   expectations for 1.56 million, too.For the full year,Netflix's subscriber additions accelerated, with NFLX packing on 19 million net subscribers in 2016, versus   17.4 million in 2015.Helping Netflix achieve those additions was a big push toward   expanding its original content, which will continue this year as   the company plans to release more than 1,000 hours of its   original programming.In response, Netflix stock saw a host of upgrades, including   from Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.NFLX stock was up more than 8% in Thursday's premarket   trade.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)TSLA shares were up solidly on Thursday in response to a   Morgan Stanley upgrade.Morgan Stanley has turned up its rating on shares from   ""Equalweight"" to ""Overweight,"" and lifted its price target from   $242 to $305.

The investment represents an important step for Tesla ahead of   its planned high-volume Model 3 production later this year.Tesla Gigafactory construction progress as of Jan. 3. Image   source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Model 3 drive-unit productionAfter introducing Tesla's chief technology officer JB Straubel   at Nevada's State of the State Address this week, Nevada Governor   Brian Sandoval confirmed Tesla's Model 3 drive-unit production;   it is expected to yield over $350 million of incremental   investment in the state, and add 550 new skilled jobs to Nevada's   economy.Tesla job postings have already indicated the company was   working on drive-unit production at the Gigafactory, but this   announcement officially confirms the electric-car maker's   commitment to drive-unit manufacturing -- specifically for its   upcoming Model 3.Drive-unit production expands the already mind-boggling scope   of Tesla's Gigafactory, which Sandoval summarized in his   address:As you all know, Tesla's Gigafactory project has     impressively contributed to our economic growth story.     Currently, Tesla has over 1,000 full-time employees and 2,000     construction workers on site, and five million square feet of     the Gigafactory is already built.By the time Tesla's Gigafactory is finished, it will be the   largest building on earth.Tesla's Gigafactory was designed primarily to build battery   cells and packs for its vehicles and its energy storage products   as the company's vehicle sales increase. The company is building   the factory in a unique phased approach, building it in sections   and then immediately beginning manufacturing in finished areas.   At the factory, Tesla has already started mass-producing the   lithium-ion battery cells for its energy storage products; it   will begin Model 3 cell production in the second quarter.Tesla recently announced the company's Gigafactory haddoubled in sizebetween July of last year and January, expanding to a 1.9   million-square-foot footprint, with 4.9 million square feet on   several levels of operational space.When it's completed, the Gigafactory will be the largest   building on Earth.Big investments ahead of the Model 3Tesla's expanding production at the Gigafactory is just one   aspect of the company's production-capacity expansion ahead of   its Model 3 launch.The Model 3.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Inches Closer to Its Important Autopilot Update;1/17/2017;"Over the weekend, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) beamed a key update for its ""enhanced"" autopilot   to vehicles with its October-introduced sensor suite, or what   Tesla calls its hardware two vehicles (HW2).But there's a catch. Besides the first 1,000 vehicles already   running the new software, this update for Tesla's driver-assist   technology is only operating in ""non-actuating mode to assess   reliability,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk explained onTwitter. The full rollout of the new features, if everything ""looks   good,"" will happen by the end of the week, Musk said.makeArticleAd();Inside Tesla's model X. Image source: The Motley Fool.The next steps for AutopilotTesla's upcoming Autopilot for HW2 vehicles will be aimed   mostly at catching up Tesla's HW2 vehicles to its HW1 vehicles.   The update should include ""most"" of the functionality from HW1   vehicles, Musk explained on Twitter in December. This is in line   with the company's initial plan for the new technology. When   Tesla first announced its new autopilot sensors, it said HW2   vehicles would initially lack HW1 features as it validates the   sensors with more robust driving data.Over time, of course, Tesla expects the improved sensor suite   to deliver an upgraded autopilot experience, which Tesla calls   enhanced autopilot. And the company says the sensors will   eventually be enough to enable autonomous driving. But Tesla will   need to extensively validate and refine self-driving features, as   well as obtain regulatory approval.Enhanced autopilot. Image source: Tesla Motors.This autopilot update is just one of many new features Tesla   plans to deliver wireless to its vehicles in the near future.   After following through with its promised updates for its   original autopilot announcement in October 2014, the company has   recently been more transparent about the next steps for the   driver-assist technology. For instance, Musk tweeted this weekend   that there are still ""many improvements"" to be released for its   HW1 vehicles ""over the course of the year."" And Tesla has   promised a range of new features to eventually make it to   enhanced autopilot, including:Automatic lane changes without requiring driver inputTransitions from one freeway to anotherExiting the freewaySelf-parking when near a parking spotHowever, as Tesla's autopilot features more closely resemble   autonomous driving, the company is careful to emphasize that   these new features are ""subject to regulatory approval.""Tesla has also been transparent about its plan to make HW2   vehicles fully autonomous. The company says its vehicles will be   able to take drivers from their home to their destination without   any input and then park autonomously after dropping drivers off.   While regulatory hurdles will probably push these updates out   several years, Tesla has said it will demonstrate a self-driven   cross-country trip this year.Tesla demonstrates its new hardware's capabilities on a drive   in Calfornia. Image source: Tesla Motors.A continuous stream of new autopilot features, particularly in   2017 and 2018, will be important for the company as Tesla   increases production from a current annualized annual run rate of   100,000 units to a plan for annual production of 500,000 units in   2018. In the company's most recent shareholder letter, Tesla   listed enhanced autopilot and the hardware for full self-driving   capability among expected catalysts to help ""drive strong vehicle   order growth.""10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Moves;1/17/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of my favorite topics in the stock market these days isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). For anyone who likes an underdog story filled with drama and suspense, TSLA stock is as good as it gets.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)Tesla - the company - has been an incredible success up to this point. TSLA stock has also been one of the best stocks in the market in the past five years. Unfortunately, the company now has extremely high expectations, and Tesla stock has an even higher valuation. I've been very critical of the bull case for TSLA. I wholeheartedly believe it's one of the most dangerous popular stocks in the market today.Yet I am the first to admit that if the Tesla story has a happy ending, it could easily double within the next couple of years. If not, I believe the bottom will fall out of the stock and the company may end up dead in the water.The TSLA Stock Bear CaseIn the past four quarters, Tesla shipped76,000 automobiles, generated over $6 billion in revenue and registered $874 million in net income losses. Last year,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) shipped 9.8 million automobiles globally.In the past four quarters, GM generated $162.1 billion in revenue and reported net profits of $14 billion. Yet somehow, TSLA stock is valued at a market cap of $39.2 billion compared to GM's valuation of $56.9 billion.7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017Why? The Tesla bull case involves the Model 3 and subsequent affordable Tesla models taking over the global mass auto market. If that's the case, TSLA stock will eventually justify its absurd valuation.I'm skeptical. Elon Musk has made too many promises that will require perfect execution to keep. Anyone who has operated in the business world knows things rarely go exactly according to plan. Tesla plans to ramp production from 50,000 in 2015 to 76,000 in 2016 to 500,000 in 2018. Musk also promises that Model 3s will begin shipping by the end of 2017 andwill startat $35,000.Just ask any TSLA stock bull, and those are the reasons they like the stock. To me, that means that at the bare minimum, all of those assumptions need to actually happen to justify Tesla's current valuation.TSLA Stock Is Too Dangerous to ShortUnfortunately for traders betting against TSLA stock, they have plenty of company. According toshortsqueeze.com, it has a short percent of float of nearly 30% with 8.7 days to cover. That means any dip in share price will likely be met with short covering. Any potential good news could also be followed by a huge short squeeze.Despite my belief that TSLA stock is extremely overvalued, these risks have kept me away from ever taking a short position in the stock. The way I see it, Tesla has so much potential for volatility in the next couple of years, both longs and shorts are playing a dangerous game.When a friend asked me the other day where I think TSLA's share price will be by 2019, I told him probably $50. Then I added that if it's not below $100, it will probably be above $500. Tesla is either going to deliver on its story with a happy ending or it won't.A LEAPS Straddle Bet On TSLA StockAfter the conversation with my friend, I got to thinking about the hypothetical $50 or $500 binary outcome for TSLA stock and what could be the best way to create a neutral trade based on that idea. The uncertainty makes long-term options very expensive. But if you agree with my premise that Tesla will be making a major move one way or the other within the next couple of years, it is possible to set up a straddle trade using 2019 TSLA LEAPS.At a strike price of $220, the Jan 2019 TSLA LEAPS calls last traded at about $57. The $220 puts last traded at around $50. If you invest equally in both options, you will require roughly a $100 move in one direction or the other to break even on your trade. That means that if TSLA ends up above $320 or below $120 by January 2019, you've made a profit. If TSLA ends up at $50, you've earned a return of roughly 70%. If TSLA makes it to $500, you've earned a return of roughly 180%.Take Advantage of a Misunderstood Fitbit Inc (FIT) StockThose returns are lopsided simply because the options market appears to be fairly bearish on TSLA stock in the long-term.If you're on the fence about which direction Tesla stock is headed in the next two years but agree with the idea that it will be making a huge move in one direction or the other, consider a 2019 LEAPS straddle trade like the one described above. Then you can simply sit back and enjoy the end of the TSLA story, one way or another.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Healthcare Stocks That Will Cripple Your Portfolio10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyThe postProfit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Movesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);1/17/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointed sharply lower this morning, as Wall Street came back from the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in a selling mood. Comments from President-elect Donald Trump on China and the U.S. dollar helped spur the selloff, as Trump toldThe Wall Street Journalthat the dollar was ""too strong"" due to China manipulating the yuan.makeArticleAd();Adding fuel to the fire, British Prime Minister Theresa May is said to be pushing for a ""hard Brexit"" from the EU.Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave fallen 0.41%,S&P 500futures have shed 0.51% andNasdaq-100futures are down 0.52%.On the options front, Friday's volume was brisk heading into the three-day weekend. Overall, roughly 15.4 million calls and 13.4 million puts crossed the tape on Friday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed to 0.63 from Thursday's one-week high of 0.68, while the 10-day moving average held steady in two-month high territory at 0.67.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) call volume received a pre-earnings boost from Raymond James, which upgraded the stock to ""strong buy."" Elsewhere,T-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) saw call volume ramp up amid the FCC's spectrum auction, which has led to increased speculation on merger activity in the telecom sector. Finally,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was also call heavy after the company detailed its plans to charge for supercharging stations across the country.Facebook Inc (FB)Front-running the social media giant's quarterly report,Raymond James lifted Facebook stockto ""strong buy"" from ""outperform"" on Friday.10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyAccording to a research note, social media ad spending was strong in the fourth quarter, with Raymond James stating that channel checks indicate an increase in ad spending of about 20% to 30%. The brokerage firm reasoned that Facebook should now easily hit ad growth estimates of 35%.FB stock rallied 1.36% on the news, finally filling in November's post-earnings gap lower. The combination of technical and fundamental strength pushed options traders toward FB call options in droves on Friday. Overall, Facebook saw volume reach over 962,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 70% of the day's take.Looking out to 3 Feb options, however, FB options bulls are still playing catchup. Currently, peak call open interest rests at the in-the-money $123 strike, totaling 9,800 contracts - well short of FB's current perch north of $128. In the $128 region, there are roughly 3,400 contracts at each of the $129, $130 and $131 strikes in the 3 Feb. series, i.e., the one most affected by Facebook's coming quarterly report on Feb. 1.T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS)TV broadcasters have once again lowered their asking price for prime wireless spectrum in the ongoing FCC auction which began in March. Broadcasters were originally asking $86 billion for the wireless spectrum, but have sincelowered their price to just $10 billion, and potentially setting the stage for a failure of the auction if none of the major wireless carriers bite. T-Mobile certainly could use the spectrum, having outgrown most of its current bandwidth. However, a failure of the auction could lead to another round of merger and acquisition activity in the telecom sector.Options traders ramped up speculation on TMUS stock on Friday following the news, as T-Mobile has long been seen as a prime acquisition candidate. Total volume on Friday rose to 367,000 contracts, with calls making up a whopping 99% of the day's take.Diving into the activity, however, reveals that about 180,000 of those contracts - more than half - were involved in one spread trade at the Jan. 2017 $50 and $55 strikes. According toTrade-Alert.com, blocks of 90,000 contracts traded on both the Jan 2017 $50 and $55 strikes for the respective bid prices of $2.84 and $7.55.Without additional information it is impossible to tell exactly what is going on here, but it would appear to be the closure of a bull call spread ahead of expiration this Friday. If so, the trader netted a profit of $4.71, or $471 per pair of contracts, on the trade.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)On Friday, Tesla Motors detailed how it would be handling plans to begincharging for use of its supercharger network- plans for which were hinted at back in November. The news promptedGlobal Equities Research's Trip Chowdhryto claim that by 2020, the supercharger network would add $2.6 billion in revenue directly into Tesla's bottom line.TSLA stock leapt 3.55% following the research note.How to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock After EarningsTSLA options traders also rallied behind the bullish note, sending nearly 350,000 contracts across the tape on Friday. Calls claimed an above average 63% of the day's take. That said, options traders remain somewhat conservative on TSLA stock's prospects.Looking at Feb open interest, peak OI totals 5,600 contracts at the in-the-money $235 strike, with little in the way of additional OI north of this region. In other words, TSLA options traders are remaining in a holding pattern until more news is known on how supercharging charges will impact Tesla's revenue.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right Now7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017The postTuesday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why 2017 Is the Year to Invest in Artificial Intelligence Stocks;1/16/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.The other day I sat in a coffee shop across from a student who   was studying a complex math problem. The equation took up the   entire page, and he sat there staring at it for quite awhile.   After I thought about how glad I am to not be in school anymore,   I started thinking about how jumping into a new investing market   can be intimidating. Like the math equation, it can be hard to   make sense of all the information on the page.But it doesn't have to be this way, especially if you closely   follow what smart companies are doing in new segments and pair   that with some good ol' fashioned research.makeArticleAd();Artificial intelligence (AI) is one such opportunity where   companies are making big bets on it and where the research backs   up its potential. And if AI pans out the way many are   thinking, then 2017 may be a very good year to get on board with   this technological shift.AI is at an inflection pointIn 2016, the AI market was worth just $644 million, according   to Tractica. This year, that amount will nearly double and then   grow exponentially from there. Take a look:Data source:TracticaandStatista.Clearly, we're still at the beginning of AI's revenue   possibilities, and its opportunity will accelerate over the   coming the years until it reaches $37.8 billion less than 10   years from now.Growth in the AI market will be spurred on by many large tech   companies that implement AI into their current businesses. For   example,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) uses its own internally developed AI programs to   read the posts we put on Facebook and understand the context   they're written in. The company's DeepText program reads   thousands of posts in just seconds and does so across 20   different languages. Facebook also uses deep learning to tag   our friends in photos, and is even using AI to identify people   (and their voices!) in videos.But AI is expanding its reach outside of the technology sector   as well. There's plenty of talk about self-driving cars these   days (I've done my fair share) and that's because the number of vehicles worldwide with some   level of autonomy will hit 76 million by 2035 -- and be worth $77   billion by that year.That growth is being fueled, at least in part, by AI.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) is using its graphics processors (GPUs) to create   some of the most sophisticated image processing supercomputers,   like the company'sDrive PX 2. The computer is being used by 80 automakers and auto suppliers   already, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  recently said that it would use some of   NVIDIA's technology in its next version of its semi-autonomous   Autopilot driving feature.Tesla is itself becoming a leader in AI technologies, and back   in October, the company posted a video of its self-driving AI   driving a person around in one of its vehicles --    completely hands-free -- as it navigated stop signs,   bicyclists, and foggy roads.Image source: Tesla.OK, so technology companies are obviously betting on AI's   future, and NVIDIA is proving that the automotive sector will   bank on AI as well, but it's important to note that governments   are betting on AI's growth as well.China announced last year that its government will invest in   new AI technologies over the next three years, as it tries to   create its own $15 billion AI market. And even the U.S.   government has taken notice of China's recent focus on artificial   intelligence. In areportreleased back in October, the White House said that Chinese   scientists are publishing far more AI research than American   scientists and that their work is being cited more often. The   U.S. then urged more AI research and development spending in   order to catch up and improve economic growth.The South Korean government recently turned its attention to   AI as well. AfterGoogle's DeepMind AI beat a South Korean grandmaster Go player in   an exhibition match in Seoul, the country pledged $863 million to   develop more AI technology and called on private companies to   invest even more.There's no turning back nowWith so many companies (and leading world powers) focusing   their attention on AI, there's no stopping the momentum now.   Investors waiting around to see how AI plays out could be left in   the dust, as this technological shift begins to speed up even   faster this year. Of course, there's no guarantee that 2017 will   be the best year to invest in AI. But if all of the AI focus from   2016 spills into this year, then it certainly looks like a good   bet.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Companies That Are Already Benefitting from Increased Drilling Activity Post-OPEC Cut;1/16/2017;"January marks the first month of OPEC's production cut, and   the oil industry is already responding.In this week's episode ofIndustry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman go over   this week's biggest energy, materials, and industrials news. Find   out how OPEC's production cut is coming along so far, and where   it's likely to go from here; how the cut has indirectly affected   American energy companies so far; why last year had the lowest   recorded carbon emissions since 1992; a few ways investors might   want to invest in the rapidly growing and evolving solar power   industry; and more.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Today is Thursday, Jan. 5, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I'm   joined in studio by the irreplaceable Taylor   Muckerman. Happy New Year, Taylor!Taylor Muckerman:Fireworks are still going off in the studio.O'Reilly:Yeah. You know it's a fire hazard, right? You can't do that.Muckerman:Oh, really? Shoot.O'Reilly:Yeah.Muckerman:I didn't get fired yet for it. We'll change it to sparklers   instead.O'Reilly:Is that a fire hazard, Austin? Sparklers?Muckerman:Nah.O'Reilly:He's shaking his headyes. That's bad. Our producer, Austin, does not approve of   sparklers. Why do you have to be like that? It's Happy New Year,   man, come on. He's just sitting over there with ...Austin Morgan:I don't want you guys burning down my studio.O'Reilly:Nice, OK. Doesn't he have a great radio voice, folks?Muckerman:Yeah, I think we should just give up.O'Reilly:Can you just come in here and do this and I'll just get some   coffee?Morgan:I'll just take over.O'Reilly:Attaboy. You talk about hockey.Muckerman:Well, what are we talking about? If he's talking about   hockey, what are we up for today?O'Reilly:Thanks for that transition, Taylor! Look at this guy.Muckerman:Little two-arm pass there.O'Reilly:Really quickly, I just want to mention OPEC, because   it's what we do.Muckerman:Yeah. We're going to try and trim that down unless there's   something major. But, new year, I feel like we have to at least   briefly hit on it.O'Reilly:Well, this is the first month they're supposedly going to do the   production cuts they agreed to.Muckerman:Yeah, they start the cuts. Up to 1.8 million barrels a day,   including the 11 other countries that committed to --O'Reilly:Right. The big story a couple weeks ago was that Mexico was   in on it, and blah blah blah.Muckerman:And Russia, yeah.O'Reilly:I actually just saw on the wires this morning that Iraq   has already cut production. They're actually doing it.Muckerman:Yeah, they're cutting medium and heavy crude, which   is basically what everybody produces over there.O'Reilly:I'm mildly impressed with how everybody is actually doing   what they said they would do.Muckerman:Well, we don't know the degree to the extent that they   have cut. But yeah, they have started to cut, along with Oman and   Kuwait as well. There's at least three out of the OPEC   members.O'Reilly:We're 10% there, yay.Muckerman:Yeah. We don't know much about the other countries. Mexico   wasn't necessarily cutting; they were just expecting a natural   decline of oil wells, without having the replacement there.   But of those 11, all eyes are on Russia, who hasn't begun to cut   or provided any guidance of when they might decide to.O'Reilly:I get the distinct impression that Russia views the world as   being on a need-to-know basis.Muckerman:Yeah. I think maybe they're waiting to see what happens when   everyone else cuts, and if prices rise,   they're probably going to be like, ""Well, you know   what? Thanks, guys!""O'Reilly:Well, you know that Saudi Arabia already increased their   prices -- you know how they set monthly prices to Asia and   the U.S. and stuff. They already upped it a little bit because of   the cut. They're like, ""We cut production, so we're upping the   price.""Muckerman:Yeah, upping prices. But we mentioned this a couple weeks   ago, straight from the mouth of the former Saudi   Arabian oil minister talking about OPEC and their previous   cuts, saying, ""We tend to cheat."" So, we'll be surprised to see   100% of that 1.8 million barrels per day   cut. Analysts I've seen, aGoldman Sachsanalyst says he believes around 84% of that total will   be achieved. I've seen as low as 70%.O'Reilly:Well, before the holiday, you said ""historically."" You said,   you usually get about two-thirds? Over the last 40 years or   whatever.Muckerman:Yeah, I think it falls right in that 60%-75% range.O'Reilly:If we got 83%, that'd be a win.Muckerman:Yeah, historically, it would be a win.O'Reilly:Good for them. Moving on, very briefly, to our likely   next Secretary of State under the Donald Trump presidential   administration --Muckerman:Still to be confirmed, but moving in that direction.O'Reilly:Likely.Muckerman:Likely. No one else has been named, not even close.O'Reilly:Plus he's a really good negotiator. I didn't know he   had this much money, but I guess I should have assumed.Muckerman:Yeah, he's been there since he started his career.O'Reilly:So he's handing over control of $250 million worth ofExxonMobilshares, and his net worth is like $400 million. Cool.Muckerman:Yeah, he's disclosed about $400 million in assets. That includes   pension and stock he owned and the $180 million payout he's set   to receive simply for becoming the Secretary of State.O'Reilly:It's good to be the king.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. But on top of that, he has holdings   in several other oil companies, producers, service   companies. You're looking atRoyal Dutch Shell,Chevron,Schlumberger(NYSE: SLB) , [General Electric]. Didn't necessarily disclose the full value of those. But yeah,   guys, he's an energy man, quite clearly.O'Reilly:With a name like Rex Tillerson, how could it be   otherwise?Muckerman:Yeah, that's wildcatter through and through.O'Reilly:You name a kid that because you think he's going to be an oil   man.Muckerman:Yeah. It's like having a kid you want to be a wrestler and never   letting him lay down on his back. That's basically what happens   when you name your kid Rex Tillerson.O'Reilly:Boom. Moving on to the oil market, the OPEC cut is actually   having its desired effect, at least for the price of oil. But   that, of course, has side effects, like the increased drilling   activity here domestically in the United States. Going to happen.   Saudi knew it. It is what it is.Muckerman:It's already happening. We saw production pick up later in the   year of 2016. You'd imagine it will.O'Reilly:And refresh my memory, I think U.S. production dropped   about a million barrels? We were at about 9.6 million and it   dropped to 8.6 million?Muckerman:Something like that, yeah.O'Reilly:ButHalliburton(NYSE: HAL)is hiring 200 workers in, unsurprisingly, the Permian   Basin. I think you sent me this article?Muckerman:Yeah. That's the hotness.O'Reilly:They laid off a ton of people, though.Muckerman:Yeah. Last year, if you looked at the announced layoffs --O'Reilly:Thousands. Tens of thousands.Muckerman:-- energy services companies were the worst by   far. Schlumberger had two of the top five largest   announced layoffs last year, and Halliburton was also right   up there. So yeah, I don't know if here's our new jobs, but   either they're shifting 200 to the Permian, or they're announcing   actually hiring 200 new folks.O'Reilly:I wasn't particularly impressed with this. One, it's like, 200   guys. Who are we kidding? Hundreds of thousands of people   have lost their jobs. Two, it's in the Permian. Not surprising at   all, either. The other headline we were talking about before we   came in here was drillers capping their record year for stock   sales with a huge bump in December, which is, again, not   surprising because OPEC gave the oil industry a wonderful   Thanksgiving present.Muckerman:Yes, they did.O'Reilly:This seems like a slightly bigger deal.Muckerman:Yes. You're looking at these companies going out there.   Mostly, these are small to mid-sized companies. You're not   seeing big equity raises from the integrated, or anything   like [EOGResources] or [PioneerEnergy Services].O'Reilly:Plus, they don't need the cash, but they have a little   bit of an opening, and they need to raise money.Muckerman:Yeah. So you have [DiamondbackEnergy] raising money to purchase assets in West Texas.Gulfport Energyraised some money to buy assets in Oklahoma. There are   a few other companies out there as well. You look at a record   year for issuances by oil and gas producers: $31.3 billion   in 2016, which is twice as much as you saw in 2015.O'Reilly:That is amazing. What was it in 2014?Muckerman:2014, not off the top of my head.O'Reilly:Still, that's crazy.Muckerman:Yeah. Just in December alone, they raised about --O'Reilly:And this was equity, not debt.Muckerman:Yeah, this was all equity.O'Reilly:That is staggering to me.Muckerman:Some were paying down debt, but most of them, I think, are just   gearing up, not necessarily to immediately drill, but they   think it's about time, so they're padding the wall here.O'Reilly:Yeah, that does seem to be in effect.Muckerman:And it might prove prescient, because right now,   you're looking at expectations that the cost of drilling and   fracking is going to rise about 20% this year, simply   because companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger andBaker Hughesand [Weatherford International], the services companies, gave pricing concessions over the   last couple years to help these drillers maintain a low cost per   barrel to produce, so that they could actually do some   drilling. They're probably going to try and claw that back.   On top of that, higher demand in general, the services   are going to be stretched because of the layoffs that we   talked about. So you're looking at, maybe, up to a 20% increase   in the price of fracking, which could add up to $10 per barrel to   the base cost.O'Reilly:Yeah. Was that a month ago that you first mentioned that? We've   talked about it before.Muckerman:I've had it in my mind for a little while. Yeah, those price   concessions were pretty serious.O'Reilly:They've been nice, but now they want to make money, too.Muckerman:Absolutely. And these producers, they can't acquire the oil and   natural gas without these companies. So they're   the bottleneck, and if they don't get the prices they want,   you know what?O'Reilly:Game over. So, Mr. Muckerman...Muckerman:What?O'Reilly:We're going to go from guys getting oil out of the ground to the   next stage of what might be how the world is powered with energy.   Carbon emissions for 2016, we just found out, are expected to be   the lowest since 1992. What were you doing in 1992, Taylor?Muckerman:Well, let's see. I was 7.O'Reilly:You were playing Power Rangers.Muckerman:Probably playing outside and harnessing the power of the sun   myself. Vitamin D.O'Reilly:I have to think that a lot of this is just because of way more   efficient cars.Muckerman:Efficient cars, yeah, that's big. The switch from coal to natural   gas to generate power in the United States. We saw, this year,   for the first time ever, natural gas overtook coal as the largest   provider of fuel to create electricity. So that's a big thing.   And I think people drove a lot more this year because   gas is so cheap. I don't have the exact specifics on me.O'Reilly:There were statistics. It's a calculation, like, do we fly   or drive? Especially if you have a family of four, it's very   price-dependent. And gas was cheap.Muckerman:When you start keepingVolkswagenhonest, you get down to the bottom of it, and you take all   those older cars off the street that were polluting more   than we thought --O'Reilly:Wait, are you implying that Volkswagen is the reason for   this drop?Muckerman:Quite possibly. Maybe they should be lauded now instead   of...O'Reilly:There were a lot of Volkswagen Jettas included in this,   now that you mention that.Muckerman:Yeah, millions! Globally. I don't know about how many were   impacted in the U.S. But yeah. Big deal.O'Reilly:Also a part of it might be -- and we talked about this   before -- but solar power is on the rise in Texas in 2016.   That's, of course, the other part of this. Also, I don't   know if you saw, fool.com writer Travis Hoium, he recently   wrote a piece about how Las Vegas is entirely green now for their   energy.Muckerman:No kidding?O'Reilly:Yeah. They're in a desert, so it's like, what are you going   to do?Muckerman:So that hockey stadium is going to be completely solar   powered?O'Reilly:Yeah. Isn't that nice? But, same deal in Texas. Desert   land, nothing grows, let's put up some solar   panels.Muckerman:They're catching up to California and Nevada in terms of   solar installations. I think this was the strongest year   ever for them.O'Reilly:It's also fun for them, because there's three power   grids nationally in the United States. There's the   Eastern grid, the Western grid, and Texas.Muckerman:I had no idea.O'Reilly:They have their own power grid.Muckerman:I wonder who negotiated that.O'Reilly:Well, think about the Texas mentality. ""We could have been   our own country if we wanted to.""Muckerman:Could have been. They probably will one day. Who knows? But   yeah, you're looking at 77% of all the solar that was installed   in Q3. Q3 was twice as big as Q2 of 2016, in terms of   installations, and three times as big as Q3 of 2015, so year over   year, three times more in terms of solar power capacity was   installed in Q3. You're looking at great expectations   for Q4. We haven't seen those results out yet. But, about   three-quarters of the Q3 installations were of the utility-scale   variety. So that means you're looking at potential companies likeFirst SolarorSunPowerreally benefiting there.O'Reilly:The price dropped this past year. A lot of the solar stocks   you're talking about just now, their stocks aren't doing that   great because they're having to cut prices because, at the end of   the day, it's a hardware commodity. This is what happened   with computers. If memory serves, the prices of these solar cells   were dropping 10% to 20% last year. This isn't surprising at   all.Muckerman:Yeah, they're down big, and obviously the market is   responding by increasing the demand. You're seeing the   parity start to creep up in terms of it costing the same or   less to use solar power.O'Reilly:So I do need to ask, because it lends itself to what we were   talking about before -- the switch from coal to natural gas   is obviously awesome, lower emissions, etc.   Should natural gas be worried now?Muckerman:Because of solar power and wind power? No, I don't think so.   Right now, you're looking at natural gas being the baseload   provider.O'Reilly:Because you do need it overnight. The sun sets.Muckerman:In terms of aggregate, I'm pretty sure natural gas is --O'Reilly:Here to stay.Muckerman:-- multiples above solar and wind right now. That being   said, they're catching up. You are talking about doubling and   tripling growth quarter over quarter, year over year.   That's pretty meaningful. And I don't really see it slowing   down. If you talk about reduced costs and utility scale, that's   what it's going after.O'Reilly:They're getting efficient, too. The cheap cells are, like, 19%   efficient now. Which, 10 years ago, 10% efficiency was a big   deal. The more expensive super-quality cells are in the   23% efficiency ranges. It's getting good, if you want   to do something like this.Muckerman:And I don't know how many homes there are in the United States,   but enough solar capacity was installed, supposedly, they're   predicting, once they get Q4 numbers.O'Reilly:I think there's 110, 120 million households. I'm talking about   census data. I could be wrong. I don't know how many houses that   is, because you have single people in there, too.Muckerman:Yeah. So, arguably, you have a long way to go. But in 2016 alone,   they estimate that enough was installed to power 2.3 million   homes. That's a pretty decent number.O'Reilly:I was going to guess 1 million. That's high. Wow, cool. Gosh, is   there any way for us to make money off of this?Muckerman:Well, I think we had a podcast sponsor a while back, I think it   was something like a way to invest in --O'Reilly:Oh, Wunder Capital.Muckerman:Wunder Capital, yeah, a way to invest in a portfolio of   solar.O'Reilly:You could also say the solar yieldcos.Muckerman:Or you just look out for solar, SunPower, SolarCity --   well, I guess [Tesla Motors](NASDAQ: TSLA) now, because SolarCity is no longer public.O'Reilly:You have these facilities, and they're used to making solar cells   at certain costs, and they're the older cells now that are being   outmoded, so they're currently switching over to the   higher-efficiency ones. So I think the next year or two for the   solar guys is going to be rough, but long-term, I think if they   can keep up with the efficiencies, they'll be OK.Muckerman:Yeah. And if you want to check out that article Sean mentioned,   it's by Travis Hoium, published in the middle of December, titled   ""U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Future Is Getting Brighter   for Clean Energy,"" and I can't think of anybody better to read   than Travis Hoium if you want to learn about solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, on fool.com, he's our solar guy right now.Muckerman:As long as I've been at the Fool, he's been covering that   industry, not exclusively, but I would place that 75%-85% of his   time is spent on solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, that and harking on Tesla. We love you, Travis.Muckerman:And now Tesla's part of the solar regime with their acquisition   of SolarCity, the Gigafactory is up and running, only around   15%-20% capacity.O'Reilly:Yeah, I got a push notification yesterday, I was like, ""You   didn't tell us, what?""Muckerman:They're producing lithium batteries, and then the Powerwall,   which they're selling --O'Reilly:That's the trick, of course, with solar and wind -- how do you   store this energy, if you don't need it right then?Muckerman:Tesla might be on the way to figuring it out, at least for the   residential side of the business.O'Reilly:Sweet. Well, thank you for your time, Taylor!Muckerman:Thank you!O'Reilly:See you next week!Muckerman:Yes, sir!O'Reilly:Well, that is it for us, folks.

5 Stocks Millennials Should Buy in 2017;1/15/2017;"Millennials have one of the most important things in investing   on their side: time.By starting to invest long before retirement, millennials can   take a very long-term view of their investments. And at The   Motley Fool, a long-term view is what we're all about. With that   in mind, here are five stocks that are attractive for any   millennial's portfolio.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.SquareOne of the broad trends I think we can expect to continue for   decades to come is a growing number of mobile transactions.Square Inc(NYSE: SQ) is a leader in mobile transactions for businesses, and   with Square Cash has become a leader in peer-to-peer transactions   as well.Square is losing money today, but the company is growing like   crazy and margins are starting to improve, as you can see   below.SQ Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsThe great thing about Square is that it's building a business   that will be the foundation on which thousands of other small   businesses will be built. With payment processing, point of sale   solutions, payroll, and other offerings Square is making it   easier to build a business and operate it on mobile platforms,   something millennials probably interact with on a regular   basis.Whole FoodsMillennials didn't start the organic food trend, but they're   taking it to a new level. It isn't necessarily that they want   food to be healthier than other generations have, but how food is   made and what's in it is more important to millennials than ever   before. That's been a big driver ofWhole Foods'(NASDAQ: WFM) success over the past decade, something that I   think will continue as millennials get older and more start   buying their own groceries.It's true that Whole Foods' stock price has dipped over the   past year as growth has slowed and profits sank. But the fall in   the stock price means shares trade at a much more reasonable 20x   earnings than the ratio's peak in the 60s a few years ago.WFMdata byYChartsWhat Whole Foods is riding is a long-term trend toward food   that's more transparent and more humanely produced than previous   generations have demanded. It's no longer the only player in the   market, but it's still the biggest fish, and is uniquely   positioned to become a go-to grocery store for millions of   millennials for decades to come.General MotorsTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) may be the easy auto pick for millennial   investors, butGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is the better investment long-term. Not only has GM   generated more than twice as much net income over the past year   ($13.9 billion) as Tesla generated in revenue ($5.9 billion) --   in some ways, it's ahead of the EV upstart on technology.GM bought a9% stake in ride sharing company Lyft in 2016and recently bought Cruise Automation to advance its self-driving   car technology as well. So GM is already ahead of Tesla in the   ride sharing business, and is arguably on equal footing in self   driving technology.Where GM has really jumped ahead of competitors is with the   Chevy Bolt. The all-electric EV with a 238 mile range and price   tag under $30,000 (after the federal tax credit) beat Tesla's   Model 3 to the road and will likely have about a year head start   in deliveries.It may be exciting to talk about Tesla as a future power in   the auto industry, but GM is far more established and is   executing on a strategic shift that will make the company   relevant for decades to come. For long-term investors, that's   where I would put my money today.SunPowerIf there's one trend that will change the world more than any   other during the lifetime of millennials, I think it's solar   energy. Fossil fuels have long powered everything from our homes   to our cars, but it's energy from the sun that's actually our   most abundant energy resource, providing the earth with enough   energy every hour to provide all of the world's energy   consumption needs for an entire year.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is the most efficient solar panel manufacturer in   the world, and has exposure to nearly every segment of the solar   market around the world. Everything from small, handheld solar   cells to the largest power plants in the world are powered by   SunPower solar cells, and that gives the company a unique   position from which to grow into the multi-trillion dollar energy   market.What's encouraging for millennials buying now is that the   growth is just beginning. Subsidies no longer drive the adoption   of solar energy, with SunPower winning bids in Chile, Mexico, and   Nevada that provide cost efficient energy more cheaply than   fossil fuels. And with falling costs we will see volumes grow   long-term. This is a volatile market, but if you have a decade or   two to wait, SunPower is well positioned to take advantage of the   booming solar market.NikeConsciousness about health and fitness is almost a standard   among millennials today. Whether it's biking to work or taking   yoga classes, athletic gear is going to be a staple for the   entire generation. AndNike(NYSE: NKE) is a company that's proven to have staying power in   the athletics business.Nike has proven its ability to stay relevant as styles have   changed, but it's their sales model that I think demonstrates why   they're built to last. Sure, you can buy Nike products from most   retailers, but the company is a master at dealing directly with   customers through digital marketing and direct online sales. This   cuts out all middlemen and will lead to more information on what   customers want and higher profits long-term. And as you build   your portfolio, that's a great trend to be following in   retail.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

9 Facts You Didn't Know About Driverless Cars;1/15/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Technology and automotive companies are currently in a sprint   to bring the best (and the safest) self-driving technologies to   market. The companies have been spurred on by high traffic   fatalities, increasing support by governments, and, of course,   new revenue potential.makeArticleAd();The pace at which driverless car technology advances is   astounding, which means that most of us have probably missed a   few key developments if we haven't been keeping up lately. Check   out these nine facts to help bring your driverless car knowledge   back up to speed:Google's Waymo just cut the cost of LIDAR by     90%.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google recently spun out its     self-driving business into its own company, called Waymo, and     this month it announced that it hasreduced the costof the LIDAR technology, which is used to help self-driving     cars see what's around them. According toArsTechnica, Waymo may have reduced the price from $75,000 down to $7,500.2018 is the year to watch.Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  released a video a couple of months ago     showing a person riding around in a Tesla -- in Autopilot mode     -- with the car completely in command. Tesla started adding     fully autonomous hardware to its cars a few months ago and says     it'll actively roll out software updates to bring full autonomy     to its vehicles after they go through more testing. But     CEO Elon Musk has said he wants Tesla to have a fully     autonomous vehicle on the road by 2018.Mars rover technology might find its way into     driverless cars.At the Consumer Electronics Show this month,Nissan Motor Co.(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)announced that it wants to implement NASA technology used for     the Mars rovers to help control fleets of self-driving cars.     Nissan's Seamless Autonomous Mobility (SAM) system allows a     self-driving car to call on a person for help if the car     doesn't know what to do (for example, if it needs to interpret     hand signals from a traffic officer). The vehicle would call     SAM in such a situation, and a person would map out a quick     route around the problem area. Other self-driving cars would     then learn from these situations to improve their own driving     knowledge. NASA used a similar system, called Visual     Environment for Remote Virtual Exploration (VERVE), for the     Mars rover and other vehicles, which involved humans mapping     out routes around obstacles when the rover couldn't figure out     what to do on its own.Driverless cars will make you a better       driver.Chipmaker and driverless car tech leaderNVIDIACorporation(NASDAQ: NVDA)  recently announced its new artificial       intelligence (AI) Co-Pilot system that uses external cameras       and radar to tell you what's around (such as a bicyclist),       and internal cameras that keep track of where you're looking.       The AI Co-Pilot will drive the car by itself most of the       time, but will use its data to also help humans learn how to       drive better when they're controlling the wheel.Self-driving vehicles will be big business.Boston Consulting Group estimates that the driverless car     market will be worth $77 billion by 2035. Not all of that will     come from sales of the vehicles themselves, though. Many     companies, like Waymo, plan on making money from self-driving     ride-hailing services.Not everyone is a fan of the technology.An advocacy group for professional drivers, called the     Upstate Transportation Association, is trying to get New York     toban self-driving carsfor 50 years. The organization wants to protect the jobs of     professional drivers, though a 50-year ban seems a bit extreme     (won't the AI robots have taken over by then?). So far, New     York's state government appears open to self-driving     technologies on its roads. But the state does have a     requirement for drivers to keep one hand on the wheel that     self-driving opponents are hoping can be used to ban the tech.Driverless cars might make traffic worse,     initially.A new study by the U.K. Department for Transport found that     traffic would actuallyget worseon Britain's roads when driverless cars take to the streets,     because the vehicles will be too cautious at first. When a     quarter of all cars are automated, the government agency     expects road delays to tick up by 0.9%, and the percentage     won't go down until about 50% to 75% of all cars are fully     autonomous.There will be slow, but steady, growth.One-quarter of all cars will be autonomous by 2040, according     the Brookings Institution. AndIHSbelieves we'll reach driverless car ubiquity sometime     after 2050.China could lead the autonomous-vehicle     market.China is trying to revamp its trucking industry by     allowing companies to test out self-driving technologies at afaster pacethan many other countries. The lack of regulation in the     country means that China is in a position to roll out     self-driving tech faster, though it raises the question of     whether accelerated development of the technology comes at the     expense of safety.Final thoughtsWhile there are certainly concerns around self-driving cars,   there's virtually no stopping this technology now. Automakers,   tech companies, and governments are all eager to bring autonomous   driving to the masses, and we're likely to see the pace of   innovation pick up over the coming years.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Detroit Auto Show: Why Audi's Q8 Concept SUV Is Significant;1/15/2017;"The Audi Q8 Concept at the North American International Auto   Show in Detroit. Image source: Audi AG.German luxury-car makerAudi AG(NASDAQOTH: AUDVF) unveiled a big new SUV in Detroit this past   Monday. The Audi Q8 Concept is technically just a show car, but   Audi officials said that it's a close preview of an upcoming new   full-size luxury crossover SUV from the German brand.makeArticleAd();But in addition to being a preview of Audi's new flagship   crossover SUV, it's also a preview of something else: The   approach that Audi and its corporate parent will take to get   past the diesel-emissions cheating scandal.What it is: A preview of a new flagship SUV for AudiFirst and foremost, although the Q8 at the North American   International Auto Show in Detroit is officially a ""concept,"" or   show vehicle, Audi officials were clear: Something very much like   it, probably with the Q8 name, will arrive at dealers in   2018.If so, the upcoming new Q8 will be a high-tech luxury   powerhouse with a profile that hints at the classic Audi Quattro   models of the 1980s. Audi describes its shape as ""an elegant   alternative to the robust presence"" of a typical big SUV.It is that. The Q8 Concept is big, with high sides. But   up close it seems well scaled, not enormous -- despite its very   big wheels (23 inches) and tires. Inside, it's spacious, with an   attractive design and Audi's usual top-notch materials and fit   and finish. The Concept's interior features an elaborate series   of touchscreen displays and a heads-up display for the driver;   it's unclear exactly how much of that will make it into the   production model. But much of it might.The Audi Q8 Concept's interior. Image source: Audi AG.The plug-in hybrid drivetrain seems more likely to make it to   production. It combines Audi's 3.0-liter turbo V6 with a   100-kilowatt electric motor for a combined equivalent of 443   horsepower and a beefy 516 pounds-feet of torque, which should   make the Q8 a lively driver. The Concept's 17.9 kilowatt-hour   lithium-ion battery pack is good for an electric-only range of   just over 37 miles, Audi said.""The Q8 concept is an Audi in peak form. It demonstrates the   strengths of our brand in both technology and design while   providing a glimpse at a future full-size, production SUV,"" said   Dietmar Voggenreiter, Audi's chief of sales and marketing. ""With   its next-generation display and control solutions, we are   enabling customers to experience connectivity in a whole new   way.""Why it's important: The Q8 Concept signals Audi's move past   the diesel messAudi, of course, is a subsidiary of German auto giantVolkswagen AG(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , which is currently contending with a massive   (and massively costly) scandal after it admitted to programmingmillions of diesel-powered vehiclesto cheat on government emissions tests.Audi hasn't been tainted by the scandal to anything like the   same extent at VW's namesake brand. But like VW, it needs to show   that it willmove past the diesel messinto a (cleaner) future -- and like VW, it plans to do that by   putting a very strong emphasis on electrified drivetrains.Another view of the Audi Q8 Concept on Audi's show stand in   Detroit. Image source: Audi AG.Audi plans tolaunch an all-electric SUV next year. That's expected to provide some serious competition toTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model X. But it's likely to be a niche product,   at least for the near future. Sophisticated plug-in hybrid   drivetrains like the one in the Q8 Concept will be the   mass-market alternative until pure-electric vehicles move more   fully into the automotive mainstream.It's likely that the production Q8 will feature a series of   gasoline engines as well as a plug-in hybrid version. But the   plug-in hybrid as Audi has presented it here is important: Rather   than positioning it primarily as an eco-friendly drivetrain, Audi   talked up its performance.That probably reflects a lesson learned from Tesla: Customers   will line up for electric vehicles (and by extension, plug-in   hybrids) if they're exciting and offer somethingmorethan gasoline-only alternatives. The Q8 Concept signals that Audi   is thinking along those lines for its upcoming flagship SUV.   That's a good sign.10 stocks we like better than Volkswagen AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Hawaii Is Becoming the Proving Ground for the Future of Energy Storage;1/14/2017;"The islands of Hawaii are known for their gorgeous landscapes   and world famous beaches, but they're probably not the first   place you think of when you think of renewable energy. But they   should be.Hawaii is the first state in the U.S. where rooftop solar has   become an almost standard item on homes and businesses, something   I personally witnesses recently driving around the islands of   O'ahu and Kaua'i. Solar panels are also in places unthinkable in   other locations. They face north, they're covered by trees, and   some look like they're barely attached to the roof itself. But   Hawaiians find solar to be so economical that almost all solar   makes sense, and they are increasingly finding energy storage an   economical solution as well. Understanding just how energy   storage is working here can help us understand why companies are   proving their technologies of the future on the Hawaiian   Islands.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Island energy doesn't look like continental U.S.     energyOn average, U.S. residential consumers pay 12.45 cents per kWh   for electricity. Prices vary by state in the continental U.S.,   from 9.33 cents per kWh in Louisiana to 19.95 cents per kWh in   Connecticut, but the prices in the lower 48 states pale in   comparison to those in Hawaii.According to the EIA, in October 2016 residential electricity   prices in Hawaii were 27.54 cents per kWh, and on the island of   Kaua'i rates are 32.78 per kWh starting this year. That makes   solar extremely viable given the fact that power purchase   agreements for residential projects can be found for less than   $0.13 per kWh. Utility contracts are going for less than $0.05   per kWh. And the difference means energy storage can make   financial sense as well.Big investments being made on Kaua'iSolarCity andTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) were the first big investors in Kaua'i, building a   13 MW solar plant and 52 MWh battery system. They combined with   24 MW of existing solar power to provide as much as 13 MW of   power to the grid during evening's peak hours of 5 p.m. to 10   p.m. The reported price per kWh of electricity from the   Tesla/SolarCity system was 14.5 cents per kWh.This week, AES Corp announced a deal to build a 28 MW solar   farm with a 100 MWh battery system attached. This time,   electricity will be sold to KIUC for 11 cents per kWh. When   completed, Kaua'i will get over 50% of its electricity from   renewable sources.In less than a year and a half between the Tesla/SolarCity   deal and the AES deal, the cost of solar+storage fell 30%. And it   shouldn't go unnoticed that the price of electricity is now below   the retail rate most consumers pay in the continental U.S. Hawaii   is proving that a 100% renewable energy future is not only   possible, it's closer than you might think.Islands are the new proving groundsSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR)  won a bid to build a similar system in the   French West Indies and Corsica. The company will build 20.7 MW of   solar power plants on the islands and five projects totaling 18.4   MW of solar power that will include energy storage.Islands around the world rely on burning diesel for   electricity, so they're taking notice to the falling cost of   solar+storage.Solar+storage is the next big energy trendSolar energy contracts in the U.S. are now below $0.05 per   kWh, and by the end of 2017 we should see contracts below $0.04   per kWh. So solar energy is competitive with new fossil fuel   plants on a per unit of energy basis. But the intermittency of   renewables is still a challenge, something batteries can help   address.What Kaua'i is showing is that combining solar with energy   storage can create an economical energy combination that can   supply electricity beyond the hours the sun is out. The cost of   $0.11 per kWh is economical for a Hawaiian island, and with   consistent cost reductions over the next decade it could be   economical for some states in the U.S. as well. And as   solar+storage becomes a very real option for utilities,   businesses, and homeowners it will change the way we think about   energy forever.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;1/13/2017;"Normally, this is the weekly recap where I cover the breaking   news from solar companies around the world, from new project   signings to bankruptcies. But this week, the industry's focus has   been on a much bigger picture: policy and advocacy. From   California to Washington D.C., investors will want to buckle in   for a wild ride in the solar energy space over the next few   years.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();California may make solar mandatoryAt the start of 2017, San Francisco made solar energy   mandatory for all new buildings that are 10 stories or fewer. And   the election of Scott Wiener, the author of that bill, to the   state senate hasbrought the idea to the Capitol. Wiener has brought a summary proposal for legislation that   would take the mandate statewide, which could end up in full   legislative form within a couple of months.Mandating solar on new buildings would be a huge boost for the   solar industry, but it would have an ancillary benefit of being   much cheaper than solar through traditional sales channels. Sales   and marketing costs have proven to be very high for solar because   sales staff often have to visit each home individually.Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity, in particular, has had to lower its   installation guidance multiple times over the past year, and   costs have spiked because sales are becoming more difficult.But knowing that new buildings have to have solar would help   lower sales costs, and having the cost of solar rolled into a   mortgage would lower financing costs, as well. The result should   be a combination of lower costs for solar buyers and/or higher   margins for installers. What companies will want to do next is   partner with builders to efficiently sell their systems, which is   where it's notable thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) already has partnerships with seven of the 10   largest homebuilders in the country. That could be an advantage   if the California mandate passes.The solar industry's biggest voice may be President     ObamaSolar energy has grown by leaps and bounds over the last eight   years, increasing from 1.3 GW installed in 2008 to an expected   14.1 GW in 2016. And investors have to keep in mind that   subsidies and policies at the federal, state, and local levels   have helped drive that growth.Along with falling costs, the federal investment tax credit,   state renewable mandates, and policies likePURPAhave helped drive the industry forward. The concern within   the industry is that the new presidential administration and   Congress will tear down some of that support. One of the biggest   supporters of solar energy, President Obama, happens to be in the   White House for a few more days, and he recently made a   compelling case for more investment in the future in aSciencearticle titled, ""The irreversible momentum of clean energy,"" saying in part:This should not be a partisan issue. It is good business and     good economics to lead a technological revolution and define     market trends. And it is smart planning to set long-term     emission-reduction targets and give American companies,     entrepreneurs, and investors certainty so they can invest [in]     and manufacture the emission-reducing technologies that we can     use domestically and export to the rest of the world.Policy matters in the solar industry, and to maintain   favorable policies that will drive future growth, the industry   needs to have a positive message to sell to all Americans.   President Obama may emerge as the loudest voice for the industry,   and the message he outlined above is as good as anyone can ask   for, no matter which way you lean politically.The biggest rooftop solar system in the worldTesla's Gigafactory will break a lot of records, but one   important one will be the fact that it's expected to install the   biggest rooftop solar system in the world, at 70 MW. That's about   seven times the second-largest array anywhere else in the   world.If the plant is going to get 100% of its energy from renewable   energy, the roof is a good place to start. This also likely will   be a proving ground for SolarCity's solar panels that will be   produced in Buffalo, New York.Tesla is certainly putting its money where its mouth is when   it comes to renewable energy. And powering what will eventually   be the biggest factory in the world with renewable energy is a   big endorsement of Tesla's overall vision of the future. Solar   energy is literally going to help keep the lights on.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Don’t Sweat Analysts’ Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory;1/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this week,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) finally put its ballyhooed gigafactory into motion, beginning the production oflithium-ion batteries in Sparks, Nevadain front of a crowd of a few hundred interested parties. TSLA stock soared on the heels of the event, of course, jumping nearly 5% the day it officially flipped the switch to ""on,"" and then continued to rally. Indeed, Tesla stock has rallied 27% since early November, mostly in anticipation of the milestone event.Source: ShutterstockAnd yet, while the market and most retail investors were clearly impressed, more than a handful of analysts weren't. Their concerns?makeArticleAd();A lack of fiscal details about how the battery plant will impact the company's books, for one. Another worry was about the sheer cost of the facility itself. Still another was whether the Model 3 may not be profitable when it finally goes into production.With all due respect to those professionals, you want to start worrying about these things now?Now?!?Yes. No. Maybe.Just for the record, yes, I'm the same guy who's been more critical than constructive on Tesla Motors over the years (likehere,hereandhere).7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     BankBut, my pessimism was never to suggest that Tesla's take on electric vehicles wasn't game-changing. The companyhasmainstreamed EVs. Its carsareengineering marvels. My concerns were simply rooted in the notion that most investors had unrealistic expectations; the masses couldn't distinguish between Tesla Motors being a trade or an investment.In retrospect, it's not clear if the analyst community was able to distinguish between the two either.Take the comments from Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino as an example.He said, following Tuesday's event at the facility:""Overall we found the tour helpful in illustrating the layout and process for manufacturing lithium ion battery cells and packs for its automotive and energy products. However, there was a lack of quantitative updates for 2017 and the ramp expectations.""Fair enough. Just bear in mind, however, that Goldmanupgraded Tesla stock to a ""buy"" in May of last year- when the battery factory was well underway - with analyst Patrick Archambault commenting ""We do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company's disruptive potential.""So … is Tesla any less disruptive now that it's making its own batteries en masse? The stock isn't any higher now than it was then, but Goldman's current rating on TSLA is ""neutral.""Granted, Goldman was just days away from underwriting another secondary offering of TSLA stock in May but the company didn't know anylessabout the math of the gigafactory than it knows now. The only real difference between then and now is the stock's price.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas was also worried about Tesla's lack of fiscal details now that the factory is in production, just as much as he's worried that another round of fundraising is in the cards. Again, however, that's nothing new for Tesla Motors, and it wasn't a problem for Jonas back in 2014 when he doubled Morgan Stanley's price target on TSLA stock, to $320 per share.He notedat the time:""If it can be a leader in commercializing battery packs, investors may never look at Tesla the same way again … Tesla says it will team up with partners to build the world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility in the US. We reflect the potential for lower battery costs through higher sales volume nearly doubling Tesla's share of the global car market to 90bps by 2028, driving our target increase.""Teslaisclearly going to have that ""world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility"" Jonas was stoked about three years ago. And, there's at least alittlemore clarity now than there was then. Yet, Morgan Stanley's current rating on Tesla stock is a modest ""equal weight"" despite clear progress being made since the 2014 call that said such progress would be compelling.The stock never even threatened to reach $320.And that's when it hits you … some (though not all) analysts are just taking their best guess on TSLA, beingled bythe rhetoric rather thanleadingthe rhetoric.To be fair, that's what analyst do.And it's not easy.Opinions should be updated as new information surfaces.On the other hand, the ebb and flow between quantitative and qualitative analysis from some analysts has made it tough for investors to digest those professional insights. The things that didn't matter before - like profits or perpetual fund-raising - can't be too big of a deal for the stock now.Here's Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Dominated     Holiday SalesIn other words, don't sweat the naysayers' opinions too much.Bottom Line for TSLA StockNone of this is to suggest TSLA is inevitably going to skyrocket higher, nor is it to imply Tesla stock is doomed; the actual outcome is apt to be somewhere in between the two extreme opinions. It's simply to point out that of all the reasons you may want to worry about owning Tesla shares, the lackluster response from analysts regarding the gigafactory is the least of them. Those guys are largely expected to say something in response to milestone events, and many of the pessimistic comments were off-the-cuff sound bites not meant to be taken as a complete analysis.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017The postDon't Sweat Analysts' Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factoryappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Supercharger Network Is Still Mostly Free;1/13/2017;"In a blog post Thursday evening,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) revealed the latest details on its plans to charge   new Tesla owners some small fees for Supercharger usage. As it   turns out, however, most charging will still be free. Here's the   latest on Tesla's evolving Supercharger program ahead of its   higher-volume Model 3 launch later this year.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Necessary changesAs Tesla pointed out in its Thursday blog post, ""Building a   charging network that provides quick, convenient, and   long-distance travel is critical to the adoption of electric   vehicles."" And this is why the company has been both rapidly   expanding its Supercharger locations and introducing some fees   and policies aimed to relieve congestion at crowded locations.   With Model 3 planned to launch this year and expected to be   produced at much higher volumes than its pricier Model S and   Model X vehicles, the Supercharger network will need to be ready   to handle demand from a fast-growing fleet of vehicles.Tesla started initiating changes to the Supercharger program   in November, when the electric-car maker said it would soon begin   charging new vehicles for Supercharger use beyond 400 kWh per   year. Then, in December, Tesla introduced afeefor vehicles plugged in at Supercharger locations but no longer   charging.Now Tesla is unveiling the details of the new fee structures   as it begins to deliver the first Tesla vehicles that no longer   qualify for free lifetime access to unlimited charging for   long-distance travel.In short, new Tesla customers will have to pay per kWh of   charging after using 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits in any   given year. Charging for use by the kWh is ""the fairest way"" for   owners to pay for the exact energy they use, Tesla says. But in   some regions, Tesla will bill users per minute of charge because   of local regulations prohibiting the sale of electricity on a per   kWh basis. However, Tesla says it is ""actively working with   regulators to update the rules.""Prices range from state to state, but they remain well below   the price of gasoline. Tesla gave some examples of how much   charging could cost:To put the affordability of Supercharging into perspective,     customers will pay about $15 for a road trip from San     Francisco to Los Angeles, about $120 from Los Angeles     to New York, about 60 euros from Paris to Rome, and about 400     yuan from Beijing to Shanghai.Tesla also promised that Supercharging will always be   ""significantly cheaper than gasoline.""Furthermore, Tesla ensured customers that they won't have to   get out their credit cards or cash to pay when accessing   Superchargers. Instead, Tesla owners will be billed automatically   to credit cards linked to their website account. And customers   can view Supercharger history and invoices online anytime.The goal for Tesla's new Supercharger fees, the company   emphasized, isn't to make a profit, but rather to ""recover a   portion of our costs and set up a fair system for everyone; this   will never be a profit center for Tesla.""Tesla's plan for U.S. Supercharger locations by the end of   2017. Image source: Tesla Motors.Still free (kind of)But what's perhaps most intriguing about Tesla's approach to   monetizing the network is that it still clearly aims to offer   enough free charging for most owners to rarely -- if ever -- have   to pay.Since owners charge at home for local driving and the   Supercharger network is only meant for long-distance travel in   the first place, 400 kWh (roughly 1,000 miles) turns out to be   sufficient for most drivers' annual long-distance Supercharger   usage, according to Tesla.Image source: The Motley Fool.We carefully considered current Supercharger usage and found     that 400 kWh covers the annual long-distance driving needs of     the majority of our owners. As a result, most owners will     continue to enjoy the benefits of Supercharging on road trips     at no additional cost.Ahead of Tesla's planned Model 3 launch later this year, the   company will likely continue to make changes to its Supercharger   network, primarily by continuing to expand it. Last year, Tesla   said it planned to double its Supercharger stations around the   world by the end of 2017, increasing them from 3,600 to 7,200.   The network has already expanded rapidly, with stations now   numbering 5,085.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla (TSLA) Provides Details on Supercharger Fee Structure;1/13/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAdisclosed the details of its plans to charge new customers for the use of its Supercharger network. While the company has traditionally offered free use of the charging network to customers, owners of Model S and Model X cars ordered after Jan 15, 2017 will have to pay a small fee if they use the network beyond a certain limit.Tesla is implementing this strategy to facilitate faster expansion of the Supercharger network and reduce congestion at the charging locations. The company will offer 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits to new customers every year. Tesla believes that this is enough to cover the long-distance travel needs of most of its customers, based on the analysis of their current Supercharger usage. Unused credits, however, will not be rolled over at a year end but will be reset to 400kWh.Beyond the free credits, customers will be charged for every kWh of energy used. However, in certain regions, they will be charged on the basis of the time of usage due to local regulations.Prices will be fixed within each state or province in North America and within each country for foreign locations. To give an estimate of the pricing, Tesla revealed that the journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles will cost about $15, while that from Los Angeles to New York will cost around $120. Meanwhile, a trip from Paris to Rome will cost nearly €60 ($63.74) and that from Beijing to Shanghai will be charged at ¥400 ($3.49).Tesla is developing a network of Superchargers in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. These Superchargers are industrial-grade, high-speed chargers that can revive 50% of the battery of a Model S in 20 minutes and provide full charge in 75 minutes, compared to normal charging stations that take as much as 9 hours for a full charge.At the end of the third quarter of 2016, Tesla had 715 Supercharger locations globally, with 4,461 individual chargers. While 97% and 86% of the population of the continental U.S. and Western Europe, respectively, were within 150 miles of a Supercharger by then, the company aims to reach similar coverage levels for high-population areas in China, Japan and Australia. To supplement the Superchargers, 3,222 destination chargers with 5,547 connection points were available globally at the end of the third quarter. These chargers offer easy charging at hotels, malls as well as restaurants.Price MovementTesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last one-year period. Shares of Tesla increased 11.4% over this time span, while the industry witnessed a 22.5% gain.Tesla has been facing production-related issues for a long time, as a result of which it has failed to meet delivery targets in the first two quarters of 2016. This, along with the losses incurred by the company, has had an adverse impact on its share price. Tesla's stock was also affected by the announcement of the SolarCity acquisition due to concerns related to the latter's losses, debts and cash outflow. However, now that the acquisition has been completed, investors are shifting their focus on Tesla's growth plans ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Tesla Motors, Inc.

5 Ways To Position For 2017’s Biggest Tech Trends;1/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWe are in the midst of the greatest technological revolution   of all time. After years in its nascent stages, the internet has   become a critical fixture in all aspects of our lives. High-tech   turning high-touch, to borrow a phrase from futurist John   Naisbitt, has become our reality. All one needs to do is visit   any big box electronics store to see shelves full of all the   internet-connected devices designed to help make our lives   easier.Investors who ride this internet of things (IoT) wave are   poised to reap handsome profits over the long run. The key to   success is identifying sub-trends within the overall trend then   drilling down further into the leading firms within each.makeArticleAd();The following five trends are where smart investors are   putting their money this year.Talking SpeakersI was fortunate enough to receive theAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) Echo as a Christmas gift. Though I first believed that this   ""talking speaker"" named Alexa was nothing more than a gimmick, I   soon discovered otherwise. The voice recognition is uncannily   accurate, and can be used to access dozens of apps for a wide   variety of tasks. Echo also provides an unbelievable music   listening experience despite the small size of the speaker.Currently, I am using Amazon Echo to play music, adjust the   temperature in my home, turn on and adjust the TV, and even get   stock quotes, all by simply using my voice. Among the things I   want to try soon are the voice grocery and Amazon ordering   features. I firmly think that this device is the start of total   voice automation of nearly everything.Soon all home appliance makers will be including technology to   interface with the Echo and other voice command products. At the   same time,Microsoft Corporation's(MSFT) Cortana andAlphabet Inc's(GOOGL) Home have arisen as competitors.At this point, however, there's no question that Amazon   currently has upper hand over the competitors in early acceptance   and infrastructural capabilities.Mobile VideoFacebook, Instagram, and Twitter are all vying to be the   leading live mobile video platform. Soon-to-go-public Snapchat is   hot on their heels with over 10 billion video views daily. We see   more and more primetime news coverage using these live feeds from   regular people. This trend is only getting stronger and the   sector more competitive as time goes by.On the back of this explosion, mobile data providers have been   forced to up their data plans for smartphones across the board.T-Mobile (Nasdaq:TMUS)andSprint (NYSE:S)are both keeping ahead of the curve by offering unlimited data   plans at reasonable prices to accommodate the massive increase in   data usage.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksDue to the uncertain and highly competitive nature of the   mobile video, my picks are Sprint and T-Mobile as the best stocks   to buy to ride this trend. No matter who wins the war, everyone   needs the backbone of mobile data to operate.Augmented RealityThis is perhaps the most science fiction-sounding of all the   major trends for 2017. Augmented reality is a live view of a   physical, real-world environment whose elements are supplemented   by computer-generated sensory input such as maps, video, or   sound. The first large-scale commercial attempt to capture this   trend was Google Glass. These glasses projected a computer screen   near your eye but were too rudimentary to catch on with the   public despite the massive amount of Google-promoted hype.The latest attempts at augmented reality were the Pokemon Go   game and Snap Spectacles. While both have gained a cult   following, it is way too early to determine if either will be a   long-term success. Several of my venture capital friends are   focusing on the idea before the companies going public.One of the most exciting startups, and one getting tremendous   attention and funding, is Magic Leap. I have been fortunate   enough to witness some of their technology, and it may be   world-changing. Keep a close eye on this company!Despite Microsoft coming to market with their HoloLens and   Google working on improving Glass, I do not think the trend is   ready yet for most investors' portfolios. But be patient and   track developments carefully because it soon will be.Robot CarsOnce just a dream of futurists, self-driving cars will soon be   a mass- produced reality. Driver-assist options are already   nearly standard across most major automakers. Uber has   successfully launched a pilot program with driverless cars in   Pittsburgh, proving the concept. I likeTesla Motors Inc(TSLA) andNVIDIA Corporation(NVDA) as stable investments in the robot car trend.Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence, or AI for short, is the ability of   computers to make decisions and learn independently. Big data and   capacity to process is the backbone of the AI trend, placing   Google at the forefront of the AI revolution. Its neural machine   translation system is simply a fantastic example of what we can   expect in the future from the artificial intelligence trend.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in       2017Action To Take:Keep up with StreetAuthority for the latest on these emerging   tech trends and the best ways to profit from them.P.S.One of our strategists is already looking into the future for her   next investments.Game-Changing Stocksis now offering subscribers access to the most awaited report of   the year:10 Shockingly Profitable Predictions for the Next 12     Months.

Sunrun Finds Big-Name Partner in National Grid;1/12/2017;"Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) has had a difficult time differentiating itself in   the competitive rooftop solar market, so it's taking a new   approach. The company announced a new partnership withNational Grid plc(NYSE: NGG) on Tuesday, which will attempt to leverage the   utility's customer base and infrastructure backbone.There's no guarantee that the partnership will pay dividends   for either company, but it's a novel approach to growing sales in   residential solar today.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why Sunrun and National Grid are teaming upNational Grid will initially team up to sell rooftop solar   systems. Sunrun will be able to target the utility's 100,000   customers in single-family homes in New York with the hopes of   quickly accessing the market. Similar partnerships have been   tried before, notably bySunPowerandTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity partnering withAirbnbandHome Depot. They haven't been particularly noticeable in earnings, but   being able to reach thousands of customers with a utility's help   has maintained allure for solar installers.More notably, the partnership also entails National Grid   committing $100 million to fund equity in 200 MW of solar   projects across the country. This is beyond the tax equity or   other funding Sunrun normally gets and allows the company to   monetize assets earlier than in the past.While partnering with National Grid could be an incremental   positive for Sunrun's normal operations, and vice versa, the real   partnership will be beyond solar system sales.Where the partnership could help Sunrun long     termWhat's interesting about the partnership is that it includes a   deal to look into how to create a network of distributed assets,   including solar and storage, that would provide value to the   grid. The press releasestated it like this:National Grid will also leverage its experience in complex     energy markets to better understand the transformation     occurring in the sector, and will work with Sunrun to explore     options of how distributed energy resources might be aggregated     and used to help keep the energy grid balanced and optimized.     Currently these services are typically provided by centralized     generators.The concept of distributed assets being aggregated into a   series of assets that work together is the goal of many solar   companies. SolarCity's grid service solution aims to provide a   series of benefits to the grid through distributed solar and   energy storage assets. The company also worked with SunPower, Con   Ed, and National Grid to offer a proposal that would compensate   distributed assets based on local value to the grid rather than   net metering. Sunrun is now going to be working on building a   similar aggregated asset base using distributed resources it   controls.This is another example of utilities and solar companies   working together to find ways to provide compensation to   customers and value to the grid for solar and energy storage. If   Sunrun and National Grid can find a way to aggregate assets   together in a group and sell services from those assets, it could   create more value for all parts of the value chain. And that's a   positive trend for both the solar and utility industries.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Tesla: Increasing Capacity at Supercharger Locations Now a ""Top Priority""";1/11/2017;"Ahead of its plans to bring to market a lower-cost,   higher-volume electric car before the end of the year,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been aggressively revamping its Supercharger   network in anticipation of higher demand for the charging   locations. Now the company's latest move for its Superchargers is   to add more charging stalls to existing locations.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Increasing capacity at Supercharger locationsWhen someone asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk onTwitterTuesday whether he had any plans to increase the number of   charging stalls at Supercharger locations, Musk tweeted back   saying, ""Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations   now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is   empty.""This top priority item adds to Tesla's growing efforts   recently to reduce congestion at Supercharger locations,   particularly in California, where there is a much higher density   of Tesla ownership compared to other areas of the U.S. In   November, Teslaannouncedthat owners after Jan. 1 (the deadline was later extended by two   weeks) would only get about 400 kilowatt-hours (roughly 1,000   miles) of free charging for long-distance travel per year. Beyond   1,000 miles, Tesla owners would be billed a small fee for   incremental charging. In December, it introduced anidling feefor vehicles plugged in at a Supercharger location but no longer   charging.Tesla's active U.S. Supercharger locations. Image source:   Tesla Motors.Of course, Tesla's efforts to expand its Supercharger network   aren't new. When Tesla first announced Model 3, the company said   it planned to double Supercharger stations around the world by   2017, increasing them from 3,600 when the Model 3 was unveiled to   7,200. Today, Tesla already has 5,045 Superchargers at 790   different locations. But with adding Supercharging stalls   currently a ""top priority"" for Tesla, it's likely the company's   rollout of additional stalls at congested Supercharging locations   will take place at a more aggressive rate in the coming   months.Necessary for Model 3As Tesla's planned launch target for Model 3 in the second   half of 2017 approaches, it's increasingly important for Tesla to   improve the Supercharging experience.Tesla expects the higher-volume Model 3 to significantly   increase the size of its fleet. After garnering 373,000   deposit-backed reservations in just a month and a half after the   Model 3's unveiling last March, the company set an aggressive   target of expanding annual production from around 50,000 vehicles   in 2015 to 500,000 vehicles in 2018, driven primarily by Model 3,   of course.Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Currently, Tesla is only producing about 100,000 vehicles per   year. So, if it really can achieve an annualized rate of   production of 500,000 units as early as 2018, the number of Tesla   vehicles requiring a Supercharger while traveling long distance   is about to increase significantly.Tesla has said the Model 3 will come standard with the   hardware for Supercharging capability, but the company hasn't   specified whether the vehicle will also include about 1,000 miles   of free charging per year. Either way, Model 3 owners will need   to charge when traveling long distance -- free or not.As Tesla's planned Model 3 launch approaches, expect the   company to continue expanding and updating its Supercharger   program.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

So far TSLA stock is off to a strong start.

The company just wonCar of the Yearfor its Chevy Bolt EV, its first mass-market entry into electric vehicles. And when competition fromother auto manufacturersenter the EV market in force - that will spell certain calamity for TSLA stock!Some of Tesla's 40% bearish short interest may also be muttering that Tesla will delay its Model 3 rollout which, because of its lower $35K price point, is supposed to compete head-to-head against the Bolt. Watch out TSLA bulls!There's also ominous chatter that Tesla will undoubtedly announce another secondary, or TSLA stock is burning cash and, and, and … and the list of bearish warnings is nonstop.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryNevertheless, TSLA is also up over 6% in just the second week of 2017 and shaking off some of those concerns for Tesla's 'cult' of bullish investors.It might also be pointed out Tesla has over 400,000 Model 3 sedan preorders and is sold out until mid-2018. Tesla, as an analyst from Baird recently noted, may also have an ace in its pocket with itsenergy storage business.The cult of TSLA is sounding a bit more grounded, yes?Lastly, TSLA continues to look like it wants to motor north in 2017.Tesla Stock Weekly ChartAs noted above, it has been a good start to 2017 for TSLA. Shares are up about 6% and demonstrating relative strength versus averages like theNASDAQ CompositeandS&P 500with gains of around 2.7% and 1.1% respectively.It's our view Tesla shares will continue to motor ahead as well. It's apoint of viewdiscussed just over a week ago.Technically, after nearly three years of volatile, but mostly stalled and lateral price action, TSLA is due to make a meaningful move in 2017. With its early out-the-gate gains, shares of Tesla have also reclaimed and tested the 200-day simple moving average for support and broken out to fresh 4-month highs.Net, net Tesla looks good overall. Of course, that's not to say it's all puppy dogs and rainbows for the cult of TSLA bulls. The provided weekly chart of TSLA suggests shares still face overhead resistance from congestion and a trend line or two. And on this time frame, Tesla is overbought based on its stochastics.TSLA Bull Call SpreadLast week's discussed March $230/$250 bull call vertical notched intraday gains in excess of 50% or $2.50 in profit during yesterday's session and definitely worthy of adjusting. Having said that and after reviewing the board for fresh ideas, I still like this spread as a way to ride TSLA higher.Trade JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Stock for     Earnings RichesCurrently and with TSLA at $228.40, the vertical is priced for $6.95. The spread stands to gain $13.65 or 215% if shares of Tesla can rally 9.5% and through $250 into March expiration.As stressed last time though, our preference is to either exit or adjust the position during the life of the position as TSLA begins to move up or down - and either validating or wrecking our bullish position on the name.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock Not Worth Investing In;1/11/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe saga ofWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) has been rather unexpected, to be honest. For many years, I believed WFM to be the category killer for organic food. WFM had everything going for it: brand name, decent footprint, secular tailwinds and solid financials.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Then something happened that I really did not expect, and it blew my conception about WFM out of the water.The thing about category killers is that they are massive one-stop shops for what are effectively commodities.Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) wiped out the local hardware store because it carries everything at lower prices, which it can obtain via economies of scale.WFM, however, is not quite the same concept. At first, and up until recently, it was moving in that direction by openingde novostores and by rolling up small organic grocery stores. The key point, however, is that WFM was not selling commoditized products. It was selling specialized products, which meant it was building itself into the primary supplier of those products - organic and ""responsible"" food.WFM Stock StumblesHowever, in the past couple of years, everyone has gotten into the organics game. Grocers of every stripe,Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT), and even the dollar stores started selling organics.10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help ItOriginally, I thought that this would not present any real competition to WFM. My faulty assumption was that the Whole Foods shopper was loyal to Whole Foods, and had no reason to shop anywhere else. WFM patrons fit a certain upscale demographic.Where I went wrong was that organics have effectivelybecomecommoditized. You can find organic chicken and meat and vegetable and fruit in just about any large grocery store. It doesn't matter if it is ""lower quality"" organic or not compared to WFM. The point is that labeling something ""organic"" is evidence enough to the general consumer.With organics now commoditized, the Whole Foods shopper no longer has loyalty, as we would expect of a commodity business. Thus, consumers have bailed on the substantially higher prices of Whole Foods and deign to visit the regular grocery stores more often. The result has led to lower same-store sales, and other struggles for WFM stock.Costs have also gotten more painful for Whole Foods stock. Even though revenue rose almost 11% from fiscal year 2014 to FY16, operating income fell from $934 million to $857 million, a nearly 300-basis-point drop in gross margins. Net income fell from $579 million to $507 million, with margins declining almost 200 bps.The good news is that both operating and free cash flow have remained relatively unchanged, at about $1.1 billion and $800 million, respectively. However, the company raised a billion dollars in debt in early 2016, for the worst of all possible reasons: to repurchase shares. I hate this. I absolutely hate it.Instead of figuring out how to grow the business and find traction, Whole Foods is buying WFM stock that is trading at 19.7x FY16 earnings while net income is stagnant or falling. WFM thus goes from a company with no long-term debt to one with a billion dollars in debt, paying 5% interest and stealing about 10% of profits to service debt.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely RightThat's why I don't think you should invest in Whole Foods stock. It's no longer an investment with a clear, long-term vision provided by management.So you trade it. If you look at the one-year chart, you'll see WFM stock has been in a trading range between $28 and $35. I would say to buy it under $30 and flip it above $33 to be safe. For more aggressive traders, you could short it above $33 and cover under $30. In both cases, however, set a 5%-7% stop loss.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely Right;1/11/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGenius is a funny thing - we often don't recognize nor appreciate it until it's gone. Case in point is Nikola Tesla. The innovative scientist - from whomTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)gets its name- was on a path toward inventing a free global power generator when he discovered the ""Tesla coil.""Source: ShutterstockThis system was the first one where electricity could betransmitted wirelessly. Although Tesla never achieved his dream of providing free energy, his groundbreaking work set the stage for today's technologies.makeArticleAd();Indeed, while Wall Street has clamored over Tesla stock in recent years, many would be surprised to learn that TSLA did not invent the electric vehicle. In fact, the very first EV was developed well before TSLA CEO Elon Musk - or even his parents - were born. The firstcrude prototypeswere introduced during the early nineteenth century. However, it wasn't until the 1890s that the EV entered its original heyday.The Backdrop of Tesla stockIn 1893, electric-powered cars were exhibited in Chicago. Four years later, electric taxis were ferrying people around busy New York City streets. By the dawn of the twentieth century, EVs were actually on the verge of automotive domination. In 1900, a whopping 28% of automobiles were powered by electricity. A year earlier, Thomas Edison ofGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) fame began a massive investment into EV battery technologies.Of course, it was Henry Ford and the eventualFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) that killed the EV's momentum. Mass production of the iconic Model T offered the public practical transportation at a substantial discount to its electric counterparts. As further advancements made gasoline-powered cars increasingly convenient, the EV platform was quickly abandoned, and not to be revisited seriously until TSLA entered the scene.4 Casino Stocks to Buy on Japan's     LegalizationThe eventual success of Tesla stock resulted from a primary vulnerability of fossil-fueled autos - dependence on crude oil. That not only drew the ire of price-gouged drivers, it also directly shed human blood. World wars have beenfought over oil. And it's absolutely no conspiracy to say that much of our foreign policy is centered on ""black gold.""I'm not suggesting that Tesla stock is some kind of philanthropic investment. Rather, TSLA is an investment in the future that has been a long-time coming. Anybody that's anybody -Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) - are all gearing up aggressively for digitization and ""next-gen"" computing. To assume that our transportation mechanisms will continue to be tethered to archaic fossil fuels is to believe in the flat earth.I would go so far as to say that the bear case for Tesla stock should only be limited to a clearly defined framework. Otherwise, TSLA is one of the few investments I confidently trust.Fears Surrounding Tesla's ViabilityThat's not to say that Tesla isn't without faults. From a gut reaction, shares are pricey. After all, Tesla stock was trading for around $30 a pop four years ago. At well over $200 today, that's a big percentage and psychological jump. Naturally, investors will question whether they've missed the boat.Click to EnlargeDrawing up a long-term technical chart of Tesla stock does not help matters. When assessing the publicly traded history of TSLA stock, you can't help but notice a sharp resemblance to thebusiness S-curve.In short, the S-curve is a graphical representation of the three main phases of a business or industry - infancy, expansion and maturity. The concern here is that Tesla stock has gone through an accelerated version of the S-curve, and is now sitting in the maturity phase.Adding to those fears are the financials. Let's be honest - they don't look great. Free cash flow is always running in the red, profitability margins are stressed and Tesla stock is overvalued against forward earnings.Short interestfor TSLA stock has also increased significantly since the second-half of this year.Finally, as awesome as these folks are, they're not immune to makingdumb mistakes. The buyout of SolarCityis an embarrassing example.Moving Forward With Tesla StockListen - Tesla stock isn't for everybody. But I'd like to leave you with this last statistic. Presently, everyone is talking about the EV revolution - which TSLA helped catapult - as if it's unprecedented. Yet themarket penetrationfor EVs is only 3%. The mass excitement centers around forecasts calling for 7% penetration by the year 2020.That's nice, but that's just scratching the surface. Assuming the forecast is accurate, that's only a quarter of what was achieved in 1900. With technology advancing at a clip rate, it's more likely than not that TSLA will end up on the right side of history.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017The bottom line here is to not let the bumps in the road dissuade you from Tesla stock. It's risky, it's pricey, but it has all the right components working in its favor.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Biotech Stocks That Are Catching Fire7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead     Weight Right NowThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely Rightappeared first onInvestorPlace."

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onNVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report),Daimler AG(OTCMKTS:DDAIF-Free Report) andTesla Motors(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Expedia, Inc.(NASDAQ:EXPE-Free Report) continues to cash in on strong demand for travel and one-stop online travel buying. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see double digit earnings growth again in 2017.Expedia is the world's largest online travel company encompassing many brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz Worldwide, trivago, HomeAway, Egencia, Travelocity, Hotwire.com, Wotif Group, Classic Vacations, CarRentals.com, Venere, Expedia CruiseShipCenters and AirAsia Expedia.makeArticleAd();Expedia acquired Orbitz in September 2015 and HomeAway in December 2015.Big Growth in Q3 of 2016On Oct 27, Expedia reported third quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus of $2.24.Gross bookings rose 21% to $18.6 billion while revenue increased 33% to $2.6 billion from the 2015 quarter.It had other strong growth metrics including a 17% year-over-year increase in room nights stayed, with growth of 11% if you exclude Orbitz Worldwide.It gained 14,000 properties during the quarter to 321,000 worldwide.Expansion on Amazon AlexaExpedia has been pushing the boundaries in terms of how to get services to customers for some time.On Nov 30, 2016, it announced travelers could ask Amazon's Alexa devices such as the Echo and Echo Dot to give it travel updates on hotels, real-time flight status and updates on gate changes and delays, book or confirm car reservations and more.Bear of the Day:Rexnord Corporation(NYSE:RXN-Free Report) is an industrial company that is still seeing declining earnings. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a double digit earnings decline in fiscal 2017.Rexnord is an industrial manufacturer in two areas: Process & Motion Control and Water Management. It makes engineered drive systems, seals, couplings and conveyor systems which you would find in the mining, energy and food & beverage industries. It also makes valves, fittings, faucets and drains for the construction industry and municipalities.Rexnord is headquartered in Milwaukee and has 8,000 employees worldwide.Moving Some Jobs to MexicoIf Rexnord sounds familiar to you, that's because it was recently in the news because it decided to close a bearings-making plant in Indianapolis that employed 300 workers and move the business to Mexico. The plant was located just a mile from the Carrier plant which was the subject of tweets in 2016 by Donald Trump.But these jobs, apparently, won't be saved.In December 2016, the union and the company reached a severance agreement which will pay $2,000 plus one week of salary for every year they spent at the company. Workers will also get free health insurance for 6 months.A Public Offering to Raise CashAfter the election results, shares of Rexnord moved sharply higher as investors bought up all the industrial names they thought could benefit from Republican policies.Rexnord decided to take advantage of this move. On Dec 1, Rexnord announced the pricing of a public offering of 7 million shares.The company raised $390.1 million which it intends to use to pay a portion of its outstanding term loan indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.Lowered Full Year GuidanceOn Nov 2, Rexnord reported fiscal second quarter results and met on the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38.Net sales were only up 1% year over year to $491 million. Core sales fell 2%.It described the demand environment as ""challenging.""Rexnord lowered its fiscal year 2017 EPS to a range of $1.32 to $1.38 due to ongoing deceleration of project schedules in the Middle East water infrastructure markets and a more conservative outlook for growth in the nonresidential construction and process industry end markets.As a result, the analysts have been cutting estimates.4 were cut for fiscal 2017 in the last 60 days which pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $1.32 from $1.52 in the last 3 months.One analyst, however, recently got a bit more bullish and actually raised the estimate in the last week. But that wasn't enough to change the consensus estimate.Analysts still see a 10.4% earnings decline in fiscal 2017.Additional content:NVIDIA, Mercedes-Benz Building A.I.-Powered Self-Driving     CarsOn Tuesday, leading smartphone chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report) and Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler AG (OTCMKTS:DDAIF-Free Report) have announced a partnership to build self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence (AI).Expected to hit the market within the next year, the cars will feature self-driving capabilities, and an active driver assistance function called ""Co-Pilot.""

Zacks.com featured highlights: Tesla Motors, Icahn Enterprises, Exa, 8x8 and Ocwen Financial;1/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 11, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article includeTesla Motors(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Icahn Enterprises(NASDAQ:IEP-Free Report),Exa Corp.(NASDAQ:EXA-Free Report),8x8, Inc.(NASDAQ:EGHT-Free Report) andOcwen Financial Corp.(NYSE:OCN-Free Report).Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin   Matras:A Company's First Profits Can Mean Big Profits for     InvestorsWith earnings season having just begun, now is a great time to take a look at my 'First Profit' stock screen. The concept for this one is to identify companies that have recently shown their first quarterly profit within the last year.More specifically, to find companies that havenotshown a profit for at least the previous 4 quarters, but have just recently produced their first profit this last quarter.I run this screen after every earnings season. And here we are again.Some of these companies will be relatively new, and this recent profit may be the only profit in the company's history so far.Other companies may have a long history of profitability, but for whatever reason haven't seen a profit in a while -- but has finally returned to profitability.I like this concept because, if the trend has been one of improvement, there's a good chance the trend will continue. This is true whether you've been profitable or arejust gettingprofitable.But some people (like myself for example) dislike buying companies that cannot show a profit. And there are many others who won't even consider a stock unless it's making money.Losing less than the previous quarter is indeed an improvement. And in that respect, by definition, it is growth, i.e., they're growing less unprofitable. And it's even better if the losses are less and less in each sequential quarter.But there's something entirely different about growth AND being profitable. And those are the stocks that will likely see the best new demand from new investors; people who are now, all of a sudden, willing to take notice of, and pay attention to, the stock.And that's what we're screening for today:•EPS for the previous 4 Quarters less than or equal to 0(This means in each of the previous 4 quarters (except the most recently reported quarter) the company has reported earnings of less than or equal to zero, i.e., no profit.)•EPS for the recently reported quarter greater than 0makeArticleAd();(This time, the company reported earnings greater than zero, meaning they finally showed a profit.)•Current Price greater than or equal to 5(I prefer to only look at companies over $5. But if you drop this item from the screen, it'll currently produce three times as many stocks coming thru the screen.)The screen is pretty simple yet pretty powerful.Here are 5 stocks that made it thru this week's screen:(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) Tesla Motors(NASDAQ:IEP-Free Report) Icahn Enterprises(NASDAQ:EXA-Free Report) Exa Corp.(NASDAQ:EGHT-Free Report) 8x8, Inc.(NYSE:OCN-Free Report) Ocwen Financial Corp.Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start looking for the newest companies that fit this criteria.

Tesla Just Hired the Creator of Apple, Inc.'s Swift Programming Language;1/11/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) announced on Tuesday that it just snapped upApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) director of developer tools, Chris Lattner. The   executive was integral at Apple, responsible for creating Swift,   a new programming language the tech giant announced in 2014. The   important hire comes at a critical time for Tesla as it works to   advance the software behind its next-generation driver-assist   sensor system for Autopilot.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();From Swift to AutopilotLattner's decision to leave Apple and join Tesla ""wasn't taken   lightly,"" according to a statement Lattner posted on Swift.org to   explain the move. Indeed, Lattner said he won't be entirely   leaving the Swift community. ""I plan to remain an active   member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the   swift-evolution mailing list,"" he said.But make no mistake. Lattner is definitely leaving Apple and   joining Tesla. In fact, he confirmed in his post that he will be   leaving Apple later this month.At Tesla, Lattner will take on the title of vice president of   Autopilot software. Lattner will take over for Jinnah   Hosein, SpaceX's vice president of software, who was   ""serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla   Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time,"" Tesla   said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""We are very excited that   Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and   accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" Tesla said.To fill Lattner's role with the Swift programming language,   Apple's Ted Kremenek, who is currently the senior manager of   languages and runtimes at Apple, will now lead the day-to-day   operations of the Swift Core Team.Furthermore, just as Lattner is stepping up to lead Tesla's   Autopilot team, Tesla's director of Autopilot programs, Sterling   Anderson, is leaving the company. Interestingly, shortly after   the news broke, Anderson mysteriously tweeted, ""You ain't seen   nothing yet...""Taking Autopilot to the next levelLattner joins Tesla's Autopilot team at a crucial period for   the technology's development, only a few months after the company   made the surprising announcement that it started including full   self-driving hardware in every vehicle it ships.The new hardware included in Tesla vehicles includes eight   surround cameras for 360-degree visibility for up to 250 meters   of range, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors, forward-facing radar,   and a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing   power of its predecessor.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its next-generation   Autopilot system. Image source: Tesla Motors.The sudden inclusion of the new hardware in every vehicle   Tesla produces has presented challenges for the company, which,   according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk in December, have the   Autopilot team working seven days a week.First, vehicles with the new hardware temporarily lack   Autopilot features included in vehicles with the older hardware   as the company validates the software using customer data   generated from operating the new Autopilot sensors in shadow mode   as Tesla owners go about their normal day-to-day driving. While   the company has started releasing updates to a portion of its   vehicles delivered with the new hardware, Musk recently said he   hopes the company will be ready this weekend to finally release   an update to bring all new-hardware vehicles to feature parity   with older vehicles.Second, the new Autopilot sensors presented manufacturing   problems during the company's fourth quarter, as Tesla blamed""short-term production challenges""related to its transition to the new sensors for its   worse-than-expected deliveries for the quarter.Autopilot's ongoing development is an important piece of   Tesla's business as it aggressively pursues autonomous   vehicles.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Rooftop Solar Stocks Plunged in 2016;1/10/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.After a decade of rocketing growth, 2016 was a very tough year   for the rooftop solar industry. Growth slowed dramatically and   the introduction of the loan as a viable financing option upended   the lease/power purchase agreement (PPA) model that's driven the   industry to where it is today.makeArticleAd();Vivint Solar Inc.(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) both ended the year down more than 50%, and before   being bought out byTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) , SolarCity's stock was down 60%. The challenge   heading into 2017 is that the pressures rooftop solar is facing   aren't going to get any easier.RUNdata byYCharts.Why growth disappeared in 2016The big shock of the past year has been the massive slowdown   in residential solar growth. The extension of the Investment Tax   Credit has given the industry stability in federal subsidies, but   it's also removed the urgency of installing solar. And with costs   continuing to decline, it may make sense for customers to wait   rather than install rooftop solar today.According to SEIA/GTM Research'sU.S. Solar Market Insight Report, third-quarter residential solar installations were up just 2%   from a year ago and fell 10% sequentially. The industry overall   has had to adjust by cutting costs, particularly in sales and   marketing, and by focusing more on the profitable customers who   are left.Compounding the growth challenge is the fact that customers no   longer see signing a 20-year PPA/lease attractive given the low   cost of installations and greater availability of loans, which   was a shock to Vivint's, Sunrun's, and SolarCity's business   models.Financing changes courseThe rooftop solar industry was built on third-party financing   in the form of PPAs and leases. Solar companies were able to use   tax benefits more efficiently than customers and could get better   financing terms, mainly because banks didn't know how to finance   one-off rooftop solar systems. But as the industry has grown and   costs have come down, the tax benefits have become easier for   homeowners to use and banks have begun to offer financing   solutions.Image source: Getty Images.This trend toward loans took hold in 2016 and threw the   industry into turmoil. Regional installers began taking market   share from industry leaders Vivint, SolarCity, and Sunrun because   they were more flexible in financing offerings. The larger   installers had to respond by offering their own loan products,   but that highlighted that their entire organizational structures   were built for third-party leasing, not competing for customers   based on price alone (enabled by loans).We still don't know how the financing changes will shake out   in the solar industry, but it's fair to say that much of the   competitive advantage the public solar companies had going into   2016 diminished during the year. Now, regional installers are   developing their growth strategies and larger companies have to   find a new way to differentiate themselves to stay alive.How solar installers can adaptOffering loans isn't inherently a problem for any solar   installer. In a way, it can be a positive because instead of   taking the financing risk onto the balance sheet, the risk goes   to the bank providing the loan and the installer gets cash up   front.What's challenging is differentiating yourself when nearly   every installer is using the same equipment. Price becomes the   biggest differentiator, and that will lead to lower margins in   the long term.The best plan for installers is to find a way to differentiate   based on efficiency or ancillary offerings like energy storage or   energy management products. Tesla's plant under construction in   Buffalo, New York, intends to make high-efficiency solar panels   in an intention to squeeze more energy out of each roof. Vivint   and Sunrun could partner with a manufacturer likeLGorKyocera, for example, to do the same.Energy storage isn't economical in most states today, but it's   getting close. Building the infrastructure and software behind   energy storage and management could be a differentiation tough   for regional installers to match.Efficiency and energy storage are two ways publicly traded   solar installers can start to differentiate themselves, so look   for progress on that front in 2017.An uncertain future for rooftop solarWhat's clear is that in 2016 the rooftop solar business   got a lot more difficult and a lot less profitable for Vivint   Solar, Sunrun, and Tesla's SolarCity. And the challenges they're   facing won't get easier in 2017 unless they can develop a   sustainable differentiation. That may be easier said than   done.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz are Building AI-Powered Self-Driving Cars;1/10/2017;"On Tuesday, leading smartphone chipmaker NVIDIANVDAand Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler AGDDAIFhave announced a partnership to build self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence (AI).Expected to hit the market within the next year, the cars will feature self-driving capabilities, and an active driver assistance function called ""Co-Pilot."" Co-Pilot looks to be similar to Tesla Motors'TSLAAutopilot, the company's semi-autonomous driving system.Autopilot-enabled vehicles keep the cars in-lane, adjust speed in accordance with other cars on the road, change lanes autonomously, scan for parking spaces, and even self-park. Co-Pilot, however, has the potential to be even more sophisticated.Speaking at the recent 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), NVIDIA founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Mercedes-Benz Vice President of Digital Vehicle and Mobility Sajjad KhanbelieveAI is going to ""revolutionize"" automobiles going forward.""At this point it is very clear that AI is going to be the future of computing. This is an endeavor that we started three years ago that we will put on the road next year - unbelievable,"" Jen-Hsun said.Mercedes-Benz is not NVIDIA's first self-driving car collaboration. The company partnered with Tesla last year, and all Tesla models-Model S, Model X, and the Model 3, are equipped with an NVIDIA-powered on-board ""supercomputer"" that can provide full self-driving capability.NVIDIA also showed off two other self-driving cars at CES 2017: a Lincoln MKZ retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors, and an Audi Q7, which is equipped with the company's DRIVE PX 2 in-car computer. DRIVE learns by observing the action of human drivers, and the vehicles were ""trained"" in Vegas on only four days of driving before debuting at CES.For more information on self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, check out these Zacks articles:Your Ultimate Guide to the Self-Driving Car MarketandExploring the Uncharted World of Artificial IntelligenceZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

Commit To Purchase Tesla Motors At $60, Earn 6.3% Using Options;1/10/2017;"Investors eyeing a purchase of Tesla Motors Inc (Symbol: TSLA) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $228.30/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.3% return against the $60 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to TSLA's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked). So unless Tesla Motors Inc sees its shares fall 73.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $56.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.80 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Motors Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $60 strike for the 3.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Tesla Motors Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $228.30) to be 39%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit theTSLA Stock Optionspage of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 511,775 contracts, with call volume at 511,775, for a put:call ratio of 0.71 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there inoptions tradingso far today.Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today.Top YieldBoost Puts of the Nasdaq 100 »"

3 Strong Stocks to Invest in the Driverless-Car Race;1/10/2017;"Driverless-car stocks are revving up for a record-breaking   year. If you're on the hunt for a pure play on the trend, though,   you're out of luck. There are essentially no publicly traded   companies dealing exclusively in driverless cars. But at The   Motley Fool, we're always on the lookout for creative investment   angles. Here are three driverless-car stocks that let you invest   in the technology, the car, and the data for the driverless-car revolution.1. MobilEye -- The technologyMobilEye Co-Founder and CTO Amnon Shashua. Image source:   BMW.makeArticleAd();Jerusalem-basedMobilEye(NYSE: MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car   stocks. It manufactures the cameras for advanced driver   assistance systems in approximately 220 car models. In July,   MobilEye announced apartnershipwithBMWandIntelto develop an autonomous-vehicle platform by 2021. Just a month   later, it went even further when it announced a partnership with   auto supplierDelphi Automotiveto develop a""plug-and-play"" self-driving platformavailable for any automaker to adopt by 2017.MobilEye seems to be poised for profit -- it just announced a   34% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and prides itself   on an asset-light business model. For investors, this signals   both a buying opportunity and a valuation warning. Its stock   jumped 27% after the recent news and has wavered back and forth   over the past few years alongside industry-level bullishness and   stock-specific announcements. Investors in MobilEye should be   bullish on the commoditization of driverless technology and have   a long-term perspective to weather the ups and downs that will   probably continue.MBLYdata byYCharts.2. Tesla Motors -- The carImage source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement   in its belief that automation is the automotive future. All its   vehicles come equipped with Autopilot, a technology that Tesla   founder and CEO Elon Musk says will allow Teslas to drive   themselves across the country by (hopefully) 2018. As a first   major adopter of semi-autonomous driving, Tesla has experienced   setbacks, most notably a driver fatality last May.A Tesla Motors stock investment allows investors to get behind   the wheel of an already-scaling semi-driverless carl, something that no other company can offer. But Tesla is also   much more than a driverless-car stock. The company is, first and   foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. Its recent $2 billion   merger with SolarCity also makes it a solar company, an industry   with substantial regulatory unknowns of its own. The company is   betting on significant synergies by packaging solar rooftops with   car sales, but these major moves have kept many investors on the   fence about its future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car   stock list, investors need to be sure they're bullish on its   entire business.3. Alphabet -- The dataVideo source: Waymo viaYoutube.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent company of Google,   has been making major moves in the driverless-car space. The   company has spent more than $60 million to bump humans out of the   driver's seat, and last October, it announced that it had clocked   a whopping 2 million road miles on its autonomous vehicles. Last   month, Alphabet went a step further by redefining its automation   efforts as a full-fledged spinoff business dubbed Waymo, rather   than one of its prototype ""moonshot"" projects.Alphabet and Waymo have made clear that they're not interested   in car manufacturing, a hat tip to others such as BMW that are   already well entrenched in this space. Instead, it will focus on   taking what it's learned from its cute ""panda car"" prototypes and   transferring it to commercial cars, such as the 100ChryslerPacifica Hybrid minivans that are set to join Waymo's fleet in   early 2017. Waymo has a strong technological advantage over many   competitors, but where it truly shines is its access to and   refinement of data. Self-driving cars risk being aimless   wanderers without enough information about their surroundings,   and Alphabet has more information about the world than anyone   else, and is continuing to learn how best to use it in the quest   for an autonomous vehicle.With an Alphabet investment, investors need to understand that   driverless cars are not one slice of this company's pie --   they're a crumb. With Alphabet's $550 billion market cap, Waymo's   minuscule $60 million fleet of pandas and minivans is not what   this company's counting on to drive profits in the years to come.   But Waymo is yet another example of how Alphabet is capitalizing   on its core competitive advantage in ways that were not   previously expected -- and if that's what you're interested in   investing in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for   you.Pedal to the metal?With driverless-car technology still in its infancy, it can be   tempting to take a backseat to investing in this industry. But   for risk-tolerant investors with a long-term perspective, getting   in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the   best way to snag major returns in the years to come, whether it's   by investing in the technology, the car, or the data.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best;1/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince 2012, automotive-industry disrupterTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has raised roughly$6.5 billion from investorsto support its audacious ambitions.Source: ShutterstockSo far, Tesla stock has accumulated losses in the billions from the capital it's raised. But as you may well know, past performance has little to do with what might happen in the future.makeArticleAd();Also, in its current full year (2015 to 2016 results have yet to be finalized) of operations, Tesla reported a loss of $888 million and spent $1.6 billion to develop new factories and manufacturing capabilities, including a pioneering ""gigafactory"" to churn out scores of lithium batteries for its automobiles and burgeoning solar operations.10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not     Help ItTesla also issued more than $300 million in debt and sold another $730 million in stock. Revolutionizing industries is not a cheap undertaking.Things got more interesting in July when Tesla announced it would purchase SolarCity. Investors approved the deal and SolarCity was folded into the corporate fold. The term ""clean energy empire"" has been mentioned, with potential synergies of using Tesla's batteries to store energy produced from solar panels on the top of consumer roofs. Clean energy is the all-around goal.Tesla's Auto AmbitionsOf course, Tesla has huge plans and first intends to revolutionize the automotive industry. In many respects, it isjust getting warmed upas a company. Its fourth-quarter net orders for new cars (its Model S and Model X) jumped 52%. Vehicle production increased an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016.Scale is key for Tesla's vehicle operations. It will improve car reliability and lower warranty costs because of manufacturing efficiencies. Growth also provides operating leverage. More sales help offset fixed costs in factories, showrooms and everything that goes with building a car company from the ground up. Management likes to highlight a steady improvement in gross margins to illustrate the benefits of its growing scale.The Solar and Autonomous Auto WildcardsThe same goes for SolarCity. Elon Musk, who effectively controlled both Tesla and SolarCity before they merged, spoke to creating a solar roof product for homes. Manufacturing scale also benefits the production of solar panels and distributing throughout the country. High-efficiency cells at a low cost is the goal in this part of the business.Tesla also has big plans for self-driving cars. Other players in the space include the venture capital unit ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), who builds chips to support autonomous vehicle capabilities.Is Tesla Too Ambitious?There is certainly an argument to be made that Tesla is too ambitious. Musk has spoken about producing a million cars by 2020, and its gigafactory is said to cost as much as $5 billion, though other partners and suppliers will share in the expense.SolarCity is thought to be cash flow neutral when it is officially folded in during the last quarter of 2016. However, it did add more debt to the capital structure.Analysts are projecting earnings losses for 2016 and 2017. This year, they estimate a loss of $2.15, but a significant improvement to a loss of only 73 cents for all of 2017.Those that are offering an investment opinion overwhelmingly believe the stock is a ""hold"" (versus a sell or buy) right now.There is little denying the investment uncertainty is high for Tesla stock. There are many moving parts, and there isn't much current visibility on positive profit or cash flow production. In fact, there are likely to be many more years of aggressive spending and investment to scale the car and solar operations.The Bottom Line on Tesla StockThe market capitalization for Tesla stock currently sits around $37 billion. That seems a rather high number for a company generating only about $6 billion in annual sales and nothing to speak of in terms of profits.An investment in Tesla stock is really a call on Elon Musk's ambitions and his vision of creating a truly revolutionary automotive and energy firm. Certainly, energy stored via batteries has many benefits over current technologies supported by gas and other fossil fuels to create energy.Storing energy through batteries has huge potential ramifications for the global energy sector, and helping scale that development via a giant gigafactory in the Nevada desert could turn out truly revolutionary.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017But investing in the potential is another story.To me, it seems too risky to hope that sales and profits come flowing in within a decade. There will likely be many ups and downs, with many chances for investors to buy in with more certainty down the road.Until then, they might want to consider stodgyGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM), which has a reasonable valuation and high dividend yield. It won't benefit from the growth in consumer solar panels, but stands a good chance at participating in the electric and autonomous automobile markets that Tesla is paving a new path in.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetThe 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a ""Hold"" at Bestappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a Survivor;1/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWhether it's good news or bad news forAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) shareholders remains to be seen, but the e-commerce giant is   finally starting to crack down on the counterfeit merchandise   that's a little too easy to buy (usually unknowingly) through its   online-shopping sites. Last week, the Chinese e-tailer sued two   vendors for selling fake Swarovski watches.The upside to the value of BABA stock is that with this official   anti-bootlegged-brands stance, Alibaba's e-commerce site gains   more credibility as a venue … among consumers as well as   vendors.makeArticleAd();The downside is, a big chunk of Alibaba stock was built   on sales of low-cost counterfeit goods. On balance though,   there's not quite as much risk to BABA stock in the   company's newest position on fakes.BABA: Enough Is EnoughAny statistic that describes the amount of fake merchandise   available via Alibaba's e-commerce platform should be taken with   a grain of salt; nobody truly knows. That hasn't prevented   counterfeit watchdog NetNames from taking a guess though; it   believes anywherebetween 20% and 80%of the goods sold via Alibaba's Taoboa aren't actually made by   the companies their logos, looks and tags are supposed to   imply.NetNames' suggested range of fake merchandise sold by Alibaba   is admittedly wide, but that disparity underscores the complexity   of the problem. Even if the real number is somewhere in the   middle though, at 50%, that's still 50% too much.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksIt's an issue that has nagged BABA stock holders for years,   though it has become a much more serious concern over the course   of the past year or so. In fact, the problem of knock-offs became   so prevalent that Gucci parent company Kering SA filed a suit   against Alibaba in mid-2015, claiming that not only did the   company not do enough to prevent counterfeit goods from   being sold at its website, but thatAlibaba actually encouraged it.Kering SA's suit was just a microcosm of how other brand names   felt at the time.The lawsuit, along with pressure from Chinese regulators,   appeared to get CEO Jack Ma's attention,finally prompting him to say,""There's no ceiling for investing in fighting fake goods"" early   last year. Little changed in the months that followed, however.   Indeed, Ma was almost defiant of the backlash in June of last   year,saying:""The problem is that the fake products today, they make better   quality, better prices than the real products, the real names….   It's not the fake products that destroy them [the real designers   making authentic goods], it's the new business models.""He may well be right, but it's not a philosophy that flies   with regulators or brand-names.The ongoing pressure seems to have finally sunk in, though.   That, or the fact that the Office of the United States Trade   Representative officially (once again)blacklisted Taobao in Decemberseems to have gotten Ma's attention. Last week,Alibaba filed lawsuitsagainst two of its merchants for knowingly selling counterfeit   goods. Presumably, the company will continue to file suits until   it makes the point that fake goods won't be tolerated at its   e-commerce venue.Or, will it?Impact on Alibaba StockIt's easy to make examples of two vendors when there are   thousands more that may or may not notice, or care. If Ma wants   to make a statement that matters, he'll need to take aim more   often, with a bigger gun.And therein lies the rub … it's not clear to what extent Ma   actually wants to crack down on the sale of fake goods at the   Taobao website.In the same sense, it's impossible to determine exactly how   much of the merchandise sold via Alibaba sites is counterfeit;   it's impossible to determine how much business may be lost (and   not won back with sales of authentic goods) should Alibaba crimp   down on bootlegged brands. But, if fake merchandise accounts for   half the goods sold by the e-commerce giant, such measures may   not actually be good for business, or for BABA stock.And ""half"" may be a generous estimate. In January of last   year, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce   released a study it had commissionedsuggesting that only 37% of the merchandise   available on Taobao was genuine.It's in that light that the underpinnings of the lawsuits may   not be as heartfelt as the more visible suggestion of them is. As   Nissan's William Forsythecommented late last year, ""They are counting the money with their left hand, and covering   their eyes with their right.""To that end, it's not clear if Chinese regulators are entirely   on board with the premise either.Counterfeiting is almost a $400 billion industry   in China, accounting for roughly 12% of its exports. Alibaba is a big   reason that industry has managed to grow at a time the nation   desperately needed more jobs to meet its growth goals. If Taobao   can't sell a big chunk of those goods, the ripple effect could be   significant.Fortunately, there's more bark than bite with the most recent   anti-counterfeiting showmanship.Bottom Line for BABA StockFor better or worse, Ma isn't terribly serious about quelling   sales of sham goods via Taobao. It's one of those things where   consumers - most of them anyway - quietly know the game,   understanding no authentic Gucci handbag can sell for $30.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in       2017The real Gucci has good reason not to like it, but a buyer of   a $30 knockoff isn't apt to be a potential buyer for the real   thing. And, even to the extent fake merchandise should be   combated, the sheer number of those vendors makes it an almost   insurmountable task.In other words, Alibaba stock holders worried the two   recently filed lawsuits mark the beginning of a much more   disruptive period for the e-commerce giant need not worry.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in       20177 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the       BankThe postWhy Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a   Survivorappeared first onInvestorPlace."

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings in 2017;1/9/2017;"With 2017 underway, these three companies account for a larger   portion of my portfolio than any other investments:Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) . Here's a quick overview of why I'm betting on   these three companies -- and what I consider to be their biggest   risks.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Walt Disney: Iconic entertainmentMy investment thesis:While WaltDisney stockhas gained about 19% since I called it ""my top stock to buy in October,"" the higher share price hasn't tempted me one bit to sell the   stock. Indeed, as my biggest holding, Walt Disney characterizes   the sort of buy-and-hold investments I love. In short, I'm   betting on Disney stock because I believe the market is   undervaluing the staying power of the company's enduring   entertainment brands, including ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, Stars Wars,   and the Walt Disney brand itself.Image source: Walt Disney.Sure, Disney's price-to-earnings ratio of 19 may not exactly   make the stock look cheap, but for a company as dominant and   iconic as Walt Disney, I'm happy to pay a premium price in   anticipation of sustained growth across a diversified   portfolio of powerful brands.The biggest risk:Disney's ESPN is having trouble growing in a multiscreen,   streaming-video environment. Accounting for more of the company's   operating profits than any other brand, Disney will need to find   a way to make ESPN relevant in a rapidly evolving media   landscape.Model 3. Tesla plans to begin delivering its $35,000 Model 3     in the second half of this year. Image source: Tesla     Motors.Tesla Motors: A big opportunityMy investment thesis:After garnering about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for its   Model 3, Tesla has previewed a large market for electric   vehicles. And the company'sconsistent 50% annualized growth in vehicle   deliveriespaired with itsbig investmentsfor even more growth in the years to come set the automaker up to   maintain its leadership position in a fast-growing market.The biggest risk:Tesla's $38 billion market capitalization already prices in   significant growth. Therefore, if the company has trouble   executing on its growth plans, it may miss an opportunity to   reinforce its leadership position and subsequently fail to live   up to the market's optimistic expectations.Facebook: A lucrative businessMy investment thesis:In Facebook, investors get an enduring competitive advantage,   industry leadership, and a profitable business model all at the   same time.Image source: Facebook.The social network's 1.8 billion monthly active users give   Facebook unprecedented value as a social platform and keeps them   coming back. Indeed, Facebook is so pervasive in many users'   lives that leaving it would represent somewhat of a social   compromise. As marketers buy up ad spots to cash in on this user   attention, Facebook's revenue is soaring and its profits are   growing even faster thanks to operating leverage. Facebook's   third-quarter net income was a whopping $2.4 billion, up 166%   from $896 million in the year-ago period.Facebook's social network looks poised to remain both dominant   and highly profitable for years to come.The biggest risk:If competition from other social networks ever begins to steal   significant attention away from Facebook, the cost of maintaining   a market-leading position could increase and Facebook's   profitability could take a hit.While I don't plan on selling any of these stocks for years to   come, I would reevaluate my investment theses if any of the risks   outlined here -- or any other unforeseen challenges -- disrupt   these companies' potential. But my hope is that I can hold these   stocks for years. Indeed, as long as management meets or exceeds   my expectations in the years ahead, I may even add to these   positions.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?;1/9/2017;"Image: AFP/Getty ImagesBy now, I think we all know what Uber is, what it does, and how it makes our lives easier. Bought too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.Launched only seven years ago,Uber Technologies Inc.is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.Increased CompetitionThe emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becominghuge competitorsfor Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.Even Alphabet Inc.GOOGLis becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.Self-Driving, Uber StyleBut Uber is right on Google's heels, and asself-driving car technologybecomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving FordFFusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.Uber also recently acquired car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla MotorsTSLA, AppleAAPL, and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.ControversyWhile Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to legal and publicity issues in a number of countries. From noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.Uber has also been embroiled in along-standing battlewith its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despitelosing over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.IPO PotentialDespite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview withCNBClast year.If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, music streaming platform Spotify, and other major tech giants have signaled plans to go public in 2017. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc.TWLOand NutanixNTNXhave traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe first rule of medicine is to do no harm. Your retirement, like your health, is something that you can't afford to screw up. And as with your health, having a safe and stable retirement is generally less about doing things right and more about avoiding major mistakes.Source: ShutterstockJust as you don't have to be a marathon runner to live a long, healthy life, you don't have to have Warren Buffett's stock picking acumen to retire well. Just avoid excessive booze or tobacco - or taking large losses in the stock market - and you're well on your way.makeArticleAd();Today, we're going to look at 10 stocks that you should probably avoid in a retirement portfolio. None are necessarily bad stocks totrade. In fact, I'd argue that there is no such thing as a bad stock to trade if you're doing it with capital you're comfortable putting at risk. But there is a difference between a stock you trade for short-term profit and a stock that you're planning to use to fund your retirement.A retirement stock should be one that has survived the test of time and that is ""future proof,"" or at least as future proof as a company can be these days. This rules out most technology stocks, which often have short lives as disruptors before being disrupted themselves, and stocks that depend on fickle consumer tastes.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017So with no more ado, here are 10 stocks that are more likely to hurt your retirement than help it.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Tesla (TSLA)Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a stock that I want to like. I really do. I love Elon Musk's vision for the company, and I can credibly say that Musk and Tesla have done more to promote alternative energy and driverless cars than just about anyone else out there.When we enjoy an emission-free future in which our cars drive us to work while we browse our messages and sip on lattes, we'll have Musk to thank for that reality.The problem is, I'm not sure Tesla is going to be the company to benefit from it. Tesla may or may not even be in business a decade from now. You see, while Tesla might have started the revolution, its larger, more entrenched competitors have been quick to muscle in. Virtually every large automaker is experimenting with driverless technology, and most are working on green alternatives.Meanwhile, Tesla stock trades for nearly seven times sales … and actually loses money.So, while I wish Mr. Musk the best of luck - and look forward to enjoying the fruits of his labor - I don't want to put my retirement at risk by buying the stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Twitter (TWTR)Source:Christopher via FlickrAnother tech stock that has changed the world, yet can't seem to find a way to profit from it isTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Twitter has effectively remade the news industry as we know it. It's become the medium of choice for politicians, celebrities and other media personalities to make major announcements … or to just rant.Yet, unlike rivalFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), it still hasn't quite figured out its profit model yet. Facebook finds new and creative ways to squeeze more profitability out of its user base while also expanding that user base. Yet Twitter seems to have mostly stalled out. It's also been overrun by spammers and ""bot"" accounts, which reduces its attractiveness to would-be advertisers.7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     BankTwitter trades for about five times sales, which is more or less in line with many other large tech companies. Yet Twitter is still struggling to figure out its business model, which is ridiculous this late in the game. If you want a social media stock to buy and hold, go with Facebook … and dump Twitter.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Macy's (M)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrMacy's Inc(NYSE:M), after the beating it has taken of late, might actually be a decent short-term trade. But I wouldn't want to bet my retirement portfolio on it.Macy's, along with several other department stores, had a lousy holiday shopping season - and this despite American shoppers eagerly opening their wallets in 2016.The issue is that Americans are doing more and more of their shopping online these days, benefitting the likes ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its online peers. Brick-and-mortar retailers in general have suffered, and big department stores like Macy's have suffered the worst.I don't expect department stores to collectively go out of business. After a period of consolidation, they will find their new place in a retail market in which the primary role of a brick-and-mortar store is to act as a showroom of sorts. But after the dust settles, I'd recommend steering clear of department stores, at least with your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: IBM (IBM)Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) just can't seem to do anything right these days. Its revenues have been in decline for an almost unbelievable 18 consecutive quarters.That's four and a halfyearsof sales declines. You would think that by now the comparable sales would be so low that IBM would have an easy time posting at least modest growth … yet the losses continue.IBM is a perfect example of a company that is far from future proof. It's traditional business model was blown out of the water by cloud upstarts like Amazon andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), and IBM has adapted at a sluggish pace. Frankly, the IBM pedigree just isn't worth what it used to be.10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetIBM was one of Warren Buffett's biggest portfolio additions of the past decade, and Buffett bought it precisely because he liked the recurring nature of IBM's income stream from long-term service contracts. Well, the cloud killed that business model, so it's time to move on. Dump IBM from your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Chipotle (CMG)Source: ShutterstockI loveChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) burritos. I really do. I could quite literally eat one every day of my life and never get sick of them (no E. coli pun intended). But as much as I love the company's food, the stock is one I'd consider risky as a long-term holding for a retirement portfolio.Food, like clothing, is subject to the whims of fashion. And Chipotle was one of the first chains to capitalize on the trend toward healthier eating with more organic ingredients. The problem is that there is no real durable competitive advantage there. Any Johnny-come-lately restaurant chain can jump on the organic bandwagon.Despite the beating that Chipotle stock has taken in recent years, due mostly to its health scandals and poor response, CMG stock is far from cheap at current prices. It trades for 44 times expected earnings. The stock price has been relatively stable for the past six months, and it could be the large losses have run their course. But this is still not a stock I'd want to bank my retirement on.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD)Source: ShutterstockAlong the same line, I'd recommending dumping shares ofBuffalo Wild Wings(NASDAQ:BWLD).As a seller of primarily wings and beer, Buffalo Wild Wings has definitely not ridden the healthy and organic eating wave that pushed Chipotle to success. No, this company's success is tied more to timeless appeal of beer and football, and the company has been in operation since 1982.30-plus years of service might suggest that Buffalo Wild Wings has survived the test of time and that it might actually be a decent long-term retirement stock. I disagree.Buffalo Wild Wing's nationwide expansion is a more recent endeavor, and its success has brought a host of competitors, includingWingstop Inc(NASDAQ:WING). The fact is, wings and beer got to be trendy a few years back, and the space is completely saturated at this point, not unlike the Tex-Mex space was 15 years ago. Diners got burned out with Tex-Mex, and I think wing shops are at risk of similar diner burnout.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryBuffalo Wild Wings isn't wildly expensive, trading at 23 times expected earnings. But I'd steer clear of it as a retirement stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Whole Foods (WFM)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Whole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) has the same problem that Chipotle does, and I'm not talking about food safety issues.Like Chipotle, Whole Foods was early to the healthy and organic movement. You could even argue that they were afounderof the movement and one of its biggest early beneficiaries.The problem, as with Chipotle, is that there is no real durable advantage there and nothing to stop its rivals from selling the same products … and doing so more cheaply.I like Whole Foods and I can credibly say that the average American eats healthier today in no small part due to the store's influence. But that doesn't mean I want to bet my retirement on it.WFM trades for 21 times expected earnings, which is a bit rich for a grocery store stock. Yes, Whole Foods is a premium store. I get that. But virtually every grocer in town is gentrifying its product lines, and you also have a budding new competitive threat from Amazon with home delivery … in some cases done by aerial drones.Buy Whole Food's produce if you like, but I'd steer clear of the stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Altria (MO)Source:Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Even 10 years ago, I probably would have considered Marlboro-makerAltria Group Inc(NYSE:MO)to be a rock-solid retirement stock.After all, people have been smoking tobacco products since the Americas were discovered over 500 years ago. One might think that a half millennium is long enough to survive the test of time.But unfortunately for Altria, the times really have changed. Due to rising health costs, virtually every government in the world has made it their objective to reduce smoking, particularly among teenagers. And it's actually working; American teenagers are more likely to have used an illegal drug over the past year than smoked a cigarette.It's not necessarily a deal breaker to buy a stock in slow decline, so long as the stock is priced right. I've made good money trading tobacco stocks over the past 20 years when their prices have gotten sufficiently beaten down.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe problem is, tobacco stock are far from cheap today. Altria trades for over 20 times expected earnings and yields just 3.5%. That's simply too high a price to pay for a company in terminal decline.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement:Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Along the same lines, I'd have to add the iconicThe Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) to the list. Now that governments have successfully beaten down tobacco use, they've moved their attention to the so-called obesity epidemic and its chief culprit: sugary sodas.And adding to this is the general trend toward healthier eating. Among the more fashionable sort, drinking a Coke is just so … déclassé.Hey, I like a cold Dr. Pepper as much as the next Texan, but we seem to be in the minority. Soda sales have been in decline for 11 consecutive years and counting.Now, Coca-Cola sells a lot more than just Coke and Diet Coke. The company has profitable businesses in bottled water, sports drinks and fruit juices. But it's hard to get enthusiastic about the company's prospects when its namesake product is in decline, with no sign of respite.At current prices, KO trades for 21 times earnings and yields 3.3%. That's not ridiculously expensive by any stretch, but it's not cheap enough given the company's growth problem. So for now, I'm recommending you dump Coca-Cola from your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement:iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT)And finally, I'm going to recommend that you steer clear of bond index exchange-traded funds like theiShares 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF)(NASDAQ:TLT).Bonds have traditionally been an important part of most retirement portfolios, and even at today's low yields I think you could make a solid argument for including bonds. But including bonds and including bond ETFs are two very different things.It comes down to interest rate risk. A bond has no real interest rate risk if held to maturity. Rising yields will cause the market price to fall, but it doesn't really matter if you're not planning to sell. The bond will mature at its par value no matter what happens to prices between now and then. But bond ETFs don't have a fixed maturity. There are presumed to be perpetual. So if we were to enter a long period of rising yields (such as during the 1970s), your bond ETF would get killed.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksConsidering that one of the primary roles of bonds is toreducerisk of loss, that seems like a lousy bet. So if you own TLT, consider dumping it and replacing it with a proper ladder of individual bonds.Charles Sizemore is the principal ofSizemore   Capital Management, an investments firm based in Dallas.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 10th Birthday Also Marks the End of an Era;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHappy birthday to the iPhone! As difficult as it may be to recall a time when the popular, defining smartphone fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't around, it was ten years ago today the Steve Jobs vision for a portable, connected computer became reality.Source:via AppleEven more difficult to recall amongst the iPhone 10th birthday chatter is the fact that the device arguably turned a struggling, so-so company into an icon, and turned AAPL stock into one of the most fruitful investments of the past decade.makeArticleAd();Perhaps most difficult of all, though, is the fact that after seeing what a game-changer the iPhone has been - for the company as well as society - in just ten years, amostly disappointing response to the iPhone 7calls into question the marketability of the upcoming iPhone 8. Some AAPL shareholders are understandably concerned we may not even bother to remember the phone's 20th birthday.Phone 7 Marks End of Apple's Smartphone ReignThere's no denying the iPhone has earned its stripes. As they say, though, nothing lasts forever. A combination of time, saturation and competition has finally caught up with the iPhone.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017The evidence of this slowdown started to materialize with the response to the iPhone 6s late last year. It was the first iteration of the iPhone that not onlydidn't sell as well as its predecessors, but also the first to see a dropoff in sales in the two quarters following its launch.Some of the company's staunchest supporters explained that most consumers were holding out for the iPhone 7, which would be a superior device.Maybe there was some truth to the idea. The same party line is being recycled now, however, with would-be iPhone buyers now reportedly holding out for an iPhone 8. It leads one to wonder if the consumer response to the iPhone 8 will be as lackluster as the response to the iPhone 7 has been, with the bulk of them holding out for what will be the iPhone 8s or the iPhone 9.And that's when it hits AAPL investors right in the gut… at some point, the company has to sell iPhones right here, right now, and grow those sales as Apple managed to all the way through the iPhone 6.Perhaps the crux of the problem isn't would-be buyers waiting for the next version. Perhaps most everyone who is going to own any smartphone has a phone they can live with for a while. Perhaps competitors have finally figured out how to make a smartphone that's just as impressive as the iPhone used to be compared to alternatives. As mobile industry consultantChetan Sharma observed:""Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way, Apple didn't have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.""And make no mistake - the iPhone 7 hasn't been flying off the shelves the way it was expected to. Two weeks ago, the Nikkei Asian Review reported the companycut its planned Q1-2017 production of the iPhone 7 by 10%compared to iPhone production from a year earlier [production of the iPhone 6s].Let's also not forget that in September, for the first time in years, Apple unexpectedly opted to not share figures from the first weekend's sales of the iPhone 7. The company said they no longer mattered. Others believed the company simply didn't want to report weaker results.The iPhone 8 Can't Stop the InevitableBut can the iPhone 8 turn things around for the company, and relight a fire underneath AAPL stock?Maybe. The usual supporters are certainly hard at work again, pointing out theall-glass body, edge-to-edge screen, and the OLED display. They all seem and sound like improvements to its predecessor. With the exception to the rumored wireless charging though, the rumored specs may well be solutions to problems that don't actually exist.That has not prevented many people - including analysts - from predicting big things from the iPhone 8.Nomura Securities, as an example, believes the iPhone 8 will break all previous iPhone sales records. Just remember, though, it was Nomura that also said demand for the iPhone 7 waseven stronger than it had expected, and that the supply chain was on the verge of ramping up production of the device. Nomuraraised its price target on AAPL stockfrom $120 to $135 in response.In the meantime, not only have Apple shares not rallied to $135 (or even $120) on the heels of what was supposed to be a big catalyst, we've seen multiple reports suggesting demand for the device wasquickly quelled.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017Point being, take any optimism surrounding the iPhone 8 with a grain of salt. We've heard it before with the iPhone 7, and it was wrong.Bottom Line for AAPL StockStill, there's no denying the iPhone has earned a spot in the smartphone hall of fame. Though it wasn't the first to develop such a product - that honor belongs toBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) - Apple was the first to make the smartphone a mainstream consumer device, and for years was the name all others aspired to be like.Nothing lasts forever though. While Apple and the iPhone will both be around for the long haul, the dominance of the iPhone that made AAPL such a great trade is fading. It's unlikely we'll remember to celebrate its advent in January of 2027.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     Bank10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetThe postApple Inc.

Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in 2017;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking an investment case forTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is not that difficult. One only needs to look toward the future. Autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and cleaner/renewable energy are expected to be strong growth drivers in the years ahead. And those are two of Tesla's main business segments. TSLA stock, then, should be in good hands.Source: ShutterstockAt last week's 2017Consumer Electronics Showin Las Vegas, for instance, cars and auto technology played an even bigger role compared to three to five years ago. The show included keynotes or presentations from almost every major automaker and A-list auto suppliers.makeArticleAd();In other words, Tesla - which arguably first intersected the auto and tech sectors - is in the right growth lane. While TSLA stock has yet to full respond to the growth drivers ahead, it's only a matter a time.Tesla Needs to Graduate From PotentialStill, Tesla's toughest challenge is to prove to critics that it can graduate the business from one of ""strong potential"" to a money-making venture. To date, that has been prevailing attack on CEO Elon Musk and what has kept Tesla stock from driving meaningfully higher over the past couple years.While Musk has delivered onthe company's new Gigafactory, which began production last week, Tesla againmissed on its most recent quarterly vehicle production target- keeping up a track record TSLA has been trying to shed. That news sent TSLA shares down some 2%.Tesla delivered roughly 22,200 vehicles during the last three months of 2016, falling short of the original projection of 25,000 units. For the full year, the electric car company delivered 76,230 units - also shy of the 80,000 vehicles Musk had promised to deliver.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksFrom my glass-half-full perspective, the fact that Tesla came less than 4,000 units shy of its full-year total wasencouraging. Critics, however, took the miss as more reasons to avoid TSLA stock.Said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson last week:""There is a high risk of execution missteps, a challenged track record on meeting timelines, cost challenges and potential impact from an otherwise full plate of initiatives in '17.""The Gigafactory Changes ThingsDespite the noise, there's also reason for increased optimism about Tesla stock. Notably,the new Gigafactory- which was delivered on time - could be the game-changer Tesla has needed.Once completed, the Gigafactory will be the world's largest factory of any kind, and eventually manufacture lithium-ion batteries for 500,000 vehicles annually, as well as for other purposes. Batteries are the limiting factor for electric cars, so Tesla's fix is to single-handedly double the world's lithium-ion battery production.While the Gigafactory - which is less than a third complete, and is expected to be finished by 2018 - has been expensive to build, estimated at $5 billion, it will accelerate the pace at which Tesla can become profitable since the Gigafactory can boost margins on unit sales of the Model S and Model X (and eventually the Model 3).At the same time, it's possible that competing auto manufactures such asFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) will rely on Tesla for their batteries.The 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017Bottom Line for TSLA StockTesla stock should be owned, not traded. While the company is spending tons of cash to deliver on its aggressive Model 3 production production totals for later this year, it's tough to bet against Musk.Assuming the company does reach its delivery target and begin Model 3 production this year, TSLA stock - currently at around $229 - is poised to regain its 2016 high of around $270.That would come out to roughly 20% returns in 2017.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The usual dazzling display of new TVs was there and as always, there were impractically wacky gadgets galore, many of them ""smart"" devices. Two companies that did not formally attend CES 2017 stood out this year.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) was everywhere, thanks to Alexa its virtual assistant.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), on the other hand was notable for a year in which third party companies werenotfalling over each other to show off the latest device designed to work with Apple's gear.CES 2017: Smart Cars, Smart Homes, Expensive TVsThis is CES, so TVs were everywhere. Big, bright, expensive TVs, many featuring QLED displays. There were new PCs, including crazy gaming laptops that cost as much as a small car and the smart home remained a big theme - evenhairbrushes got ""smart"" this year. To run all those connected devices, a new generation of mesh routers also had a moment in the spotlight.Of course, in recent years, the Consumer Electronics Show has morphed into an auto show as well. This year, there was a big reveal in theFaraday FutureFF 9. This luxury, high performance electric car has eyes on the market started byTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) - if it survives to see production.

But the company's Alexa voice assistant was seeminglyeverywhere. As mentioned, Ford is putting Alexa in its car infotainment systems (drivers can order items on Amazon or have an audiobook read back to them), and the auto maker is also giving Amazon Echo speakers advanced control over its plug-in electric cars, including the ability to start the car on command.Volkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) also announcedAlexa integration is coming.Companies likeLGintroduced their own smart speakers, with Alexa inside. A series of new 4K TVs were introduced withbuilt-in Amazon Fire TV functionality, including Alexa voice control. Alexa showed up in home appliances, including refrigerators and washing machines. It's also in a smartwatch.ADT Corp(NYSE:ADT) announced homeowners will soon be able to voicecontrol its Pulse smart home security system using Alexa.And in perhaps the biggest coup of all - at least in terms of sticking it to the personal assistant competition - China's Huawei is releasing an Android-powered smartphone for the U.S. market thatfeatures Amazon's Alexa.Alexa is gaining momentum at a rapid pace. AMZN's Alexa-powered Echo speaker grew from 1,000 skills (third-party integrations) seven months ago toover 7,000 today.CES 2017: Apple SidelinedApple never attends the Consumer Electronics Show, but for the past decade or so, the company has always felt like the elephant in the room. Not physically there, but somehow in the middle of everything. Between the iPod, iPhone and iPad, it always seemed like half the companies at CES were releasing gadgets that were made specifically to work with Apple's hardware. Speakers, controllers, cases, smart devices, car stereos, battery packs - you name it. This year, not so much.Snap Inc: Should You Buy the Snapchat IPO?And in terms of Siri vs. Alexa - AMZN's personal assistant underdog that snuck into the home in the guise of the Echo smart speaker - it's not even a contest at this point. Compare those 7,000 AMZN Alexa skills to theunder 100 productsApple lists as being compatible with its HomeKit automation standard (with Siri voice control) and you get the idea.2017 Is the Year AZMN Won the Consumer Electronics ShowCES 2017 was the year Alexa starred and marked a low point of interest in piling on the Apple bandwagon, something that has been a big part of the show for the past decade. Apple has a critical year ahead. It's hoping to rebound from a lackluster 2016 and has the iPhone's 10th anniversary to leverage for momentum.However, after what transpired during the past week, it's going to be interesting to see if CES 2017 sets the stage for a transitional year, where Amazon's tech races to the forefront and Apple sputters.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace:3 Things Apple Inc.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Shows Off Over-the-Air Updates and Fleet Learning;1/9/2017;"On Sunday morning,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the company's   ongoing rollout of its latest Autopilot upgrade. A planned   software update for Monday, and one more week's worth of fleet   data following the update, will probably be enough for Tesla to   finish rolling out its latest Autopilot improvement to all   vehicles with its new sensor suite, Musk said. The update shows   off Tesla's control of its driver-assist systems and its software   strengths.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Here comes Autopilot 2.0""New [revision] for [hardware 2] Autopilot rolling out Mon to   first 1000 [vehicles] & to rest of fleet in shadow mode,""   Musk tweeted on Sunday morning. ""Also improves hardware 1 and   enables Ludicrous+."" In another tweet, Musk said, ""If all looks   good, [hardware 2] Autopilot functionality will switch from   shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial   1000.""In October, Tesla started including a new sensor suite of   cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar in every new vehicle.   Aided by a new onboard computer with over 40 times the computing   power of the previous generation in Tesla vehicles, the company   said the new sensor suite would enable an ""enhanced"" version of   Autopilot and -- after regulatory approval and extensive   validation -- even self-driving capabilities.But, as Tesla explained in a blog post when it released its   new hardware, there was a major catch for the first vehicles   coming off the line with Autopilot hardware 2 -- at least for a   few months:Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain     features currently available on Teslas with first-generation     Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features     such as automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane     holding and active cruise control. As these features are     robustly validated we will enable them over the air, together     with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features.In December, Musk said Tesla's software team has been ""working   seven days a week to complete testing and validation"" of its   hardware 2 vehicles so it can roll out updates for them, getting   them to feature parity with Autopilot hardware 1 vehicles.Tesla rolled out its first update for hardware 2 Autopilot to   its first 1,000 cars on Dec. 31. Limited to such a small portion   of its fleet, the update aimed to help Tesla verify whether there   were new field issues before it uploaded an update to all   hardware 2 vehicles.Tesla's Monday update will get the company one step closer to   catching hardware 2 vehicles up to hardware 1, while also   delivering some new features for hardware 1 vehicles and apromised acceleration improvementfor its Ludicrous-enabled P100D vehicles, making the world's   fastest-accelerating vehicle even quicker.Highlighting Tesla's strengthsTesla's continued Autopilot updates highlight Tesla's prowess   in over-the-air updates and fleet learning -- two areas where the   automaker stands apart from the competition.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its latest Autopilot   sensors. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla's in-house developed software for Autopilot, combined   with its high level of vertical integration of all relevant   systems, gives the company significant flexibility and control in   delivering significant over-the-air updates. Further, by   including Autopilot sensors in every vehicle delivered, whether   customers pay for Autopilot of not, Tesla can garner   unprecedented data by operating sensors in ""shadow mode"" even as   customers drive without the help of driver-assist systems. Of   course, Tesla can collect data from vehicles with activated   Autopilot as well.In addition, Tesla's deep vertical control of Autopilot   systems enables the company to rapidly deploy improvements   through its ""fleet learning,"" or fleetwide improvements that can   be made in real-time with real-time driving data. By having all   their cars connected and fleet learning, the level of useful data   Tesla is able to access for improving its system gives the   company an advantage in constantly improving the convenience and   safety of driver-assist systems.As long as Tesla's Autopilot updates go as planned -- and   considering the way the company has rapidly deployed significant   over-the-air updates to its vehicles in the past, they probably   will -- Tesla is about to take another step forward in advancing   its vehicles' driver-assist systems even further ahead of the   competition.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Another Reason Tesla and Trump May Be a Better Fit Than First Thought;1/7/2017;"After Donald Trump was elected to be the next president of the   United States in November, shares of electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  fell about 5% during the next seven days.   Some investors may have been concerned about how a   Republican-controlled White House and Congress could impact   electric-vehicle and solar incentives -- both of which play a   role in Tesla's business.But concerns about Tesla's prospects during a Trump presidency   have eased after the President-elect invited Tesla CEO Elon Musk   to his Tech Summit meeting, and even appointed him to his   Strategic and Policy forum. Indeed,Tesla stockproceeded to soar 17.5% in December.Now, investors may have another reason not to worry about   Tesla's potential during a Trump administration: Elon Musk thinks   the Trump administration could surprise when it comes to   renewables.makeArticleAd();Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley   Fool.Report: Trump may be ""positive on renewables""In a telling report fromElectrek, managing editor Fred Lambert noted that investors attending   Tesla's Gigafactory event this week said Musk was actually upbeat   about Trump's plans for renewables:The President-elect has a strong emphasis on U.S.     manufacturing and so do we. We are building the biggest factory     in the world right here, creating U.S. jobs... I think we may     see some surprising things from the next administration. We     don't think they will be negative on fossil fuels... but they     may also be positive on renewables.While it's impossible to know exactly how the Trump   administration may ""be positive on renewables,"" Musk's words   about the President-elect should carry some weight after Musk'srecent face-to-face interactionswith Trump.Trump and Musk's shared vision for jobsIt's possible that Trump could be positive on green   technologies because of the potential jobs that could be created   from nascent renewables segments. It's no secret that one of   Trump's top priorities when he takes office is to create domestic   manufacturing jobs. And Musk's Tesla is arguably leading the   charge in the U.S. when it comes to job creation.Tesla alone has created over 13,000 jobs in the U.S.   (excluding contractors), most of which are manufacturing related.   And the Tesla-acquired SolarCity has created about 12,000 U.S.   jobs. Yet Tesla is just getting started.The company recently announced amajor expansionto its car factory in California -- the expansion will create   about 3,000 more jobs. Further, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said its   Gigafactory in Nevada will likely employ around 10,000 people at   peak production, and indirectly create between 20,000 to 30,000   additional jobs in surrounding regions.Tesla's under-construction Gigafactory in Nevada. Measured by   footprint, the factory will be the largest building in the world   when it's complete. Image source: Tesla Motors.Notably, however the Trump administration may impact   electric-vehicle and solar incentives, Musk is confident Tesla   will thrive. Indeed, Musk even noted in a November shareholder   meeting about the company's acquisition of SolarCity that he   believedTesla's competitive position would increaseif electric-vehicle incentives were removed, since under the   current zero-emission vehicle mandates, competitors would be able   to monetize their zero-emission vehicle credits at face value   while Tesla would only get about $0.50 on the dollar for its   credits.Still, Musk is far from being against renewables incentives.   During the same shareholder meeting, he said that Tesla does   believe ""there should be incentives."" But Musk said he believes   the incentives should exist ""for the good of the industry and to   accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, not because Tesla   needs them.""Whatever the fate is for renewables mandates and incentives   after Trump takes the Oval Office, Musk's surprising positivity   about the Trump administration's potential actions surrounding   renewables is good news for investors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;1/6/2017;"After a year of both progress and stock market turmoil, the   solar industry is likely facing a year of transition in 2017.   Companies are cutting costs so they can stay afloat, and   positioning themselves for growth with new products. This week, a   few companies moved in different directions in relation to those   goals.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Solar ends 2016 in a great positionIf you're hoping to see more solar power produced around the   world, you should be very encouraged by new data fromBloomberg New Energy Finance. The group recently reported that the cost of building a solar   power plant is down 62% since 2009, and new contracts in Chile   and the UAE have been signed for less than 3 cents per kWh, a   price that would beat any new coal plant.Solar is already highly cost effective in sunny countries, but   what's even more encouraging is that costs will likely be lower   than coal in nearly every country within a decade. It's easy to   see how solar could be cost effective today in Chile, Dubai, or   states in the American Southwest, but the fact that it's becoming   price competitive in the U.K., Canada, and U.S. states like   Minnesota has to be encouraging for the industry.The Gigafactory finally gets off the groundA lot has been written aboutTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory over the last few years, but this week   Tesla and Panasonic announced the facility is actually producing   battery cells. Eventually, the low-cost, high-performance 2170   cells jointly developed by the two companies will end up in   Tesla's Model 3. But for now, those coming off the assembly line   will be put into the Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2.2017 could be a big year for Tesla's energy storage business   as utilities put rates in place that make home energy storage   more viable, and large-scale storage solutions start to be good   options for utilities themselves. And now, some of those   batteries will be coming from Tesla's Gigafactory.Is another residential solar growth story going     bust?Last summer, residential solar company Sungevity seemed to   have found a bailout from Easterly Acquisition Corp., which would   have performed a reverse merger to take the company public. As   part of the deal, Sungevity would have gotten access to $200   million of capital, which could have kept it afloat while   management tried to steer it toward profitability.After the first of the year, the reverse merger is off, and   Sungevity seems to be in serious trouble. This isn't going to   upend residential solar as we know it because Sungevity had just   a 1.6% market share, according toGTM Research. But it's a sign of how difficult the business has been for   companies in the past year. Tesla's SolarCity had to lower its   guidance multiple times, and most companies had to pivot to   offering loans instead of long-term lease deals. Sungevity's   potential collapse is a another reminder of how hard it is to   make money in the rooftop solar business.Canadian Solar monetizes assetsThe year 2017 is going to be a tough year for solar panel   manufacturers and developers as demand sags and panel prices   continue slump. One of the ways companies are preparing for that   is by monetizing assets they have on their balance sheets.Canadian Solar Inc.(NASDAQ: CSIQ) did that just before the end of the year, selling   20 MW of Canadian projects for $115 million and two more power   plants in China for $32.2 million.The cash can now be used to pay down debt, reducing risk for   the business, or sit on the balance sheet to create a cushion. No   matter how you look at it, an infusion of $147.2 million is good   for Canadian Solar long term.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Set to Take Off;1/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor years,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has run on what amounts to the hype around charismatic founder Elon Musk and a cult following of drivers who see the cars as symbols of the future. But as the company's autopilot systems evolve and a key competitor hits a wall, the road to mass electric transport - the finish line for TSLA stock holders - looks clearer than ever.Source: ShutterstockAll of the buzz surrounding TSLA right now revolves around the mass-market Model 3 sedan, which should retail for around $35,000 when deliveries kick off late next year.makeArticleAd();This will be the ultimate test of Musk's master plan for growing the company beyond niche success and justifying its lofty valuation on Wall Street.A year from now, investors should have a much better sense of how fast TSLA can grab market share from old-school manufacturers likeGeneral Motors(NYSE:GM),Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). If it happens even half as quickly as Musk is aiming for, the company's modest revenue targets will go through the roof.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThat's not including any input from the looming SolarCity acquisition, increased sales in the existing luxury segment or any models Musk currently has on the drawing board, like the SUV currently known only as""Model Y.""The analysts are busy watching the road to Model 3, so acceleration elsewhere in the company isn't really factored into the share price yet. If anything, expectations around TSLA may actually be cycling too low.That's a bold statement in a world where TSLA stock already trades at more than half the market capitalization of more sedate competitors like GM, despite operating at a loss and as yet generating barely 3% of the annual sales. But if Model 3 ramps up the way Musk expects, we're going to see these shares break through all existing barriers.TSLA's latest tests of the ""Enhanced Autopilot"" system indicate that self-driving cars could start crowding into public highways by 2020, which gives TSLA fans another long game to play once Model 3 hits the market.And with executives at would-be competitor Faraday Future bailing out, it looks like the Model Y has a better shot than ever at hitting the road first and claiming the electric SUV category for itself. When that day finally comes, TSLA investors will be in for a very profitable ride.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

In July 2016, the company held the official opening of the partly-constructed Gigafactory as per plan. Tesla expects 31% of the factory construction to complete by the second quarter of 2017.In order to deal with the shortage of lithium-ion batteries, Tesla is building a Gigafactory in collaboration with partners like Panasonic. The automaker will receive tax incentives of $1.3 billion over a period of 20 years from the Nevada government for the construction of the factory. Tesla expects to wrap up construction work by 2017.By 2018, Tesla expects cost of its batteries to reduce by over one-third due to large-scale production at the Gigafactory.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Has Nothing to Fear From Faraday Future;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the big reveals at this year's Consumer Electronics Show happened yesterday, before the show's official Jan. 5 open. And withTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock down 1.5% today, are Tesla's shareholders getting the heebie-jeebies?Source: Faraday FutureFaradayFuture, the mysterious electric car startup thatshowed off a non-functional concept carat last year's show was back.makeArticleAd();This time the company had the Faraday Future FF 91, a working, ultra-fast electric car that demonstrated its autonomous parking capability, while boasting a slew of class-leading features.Faraday Future FF 91At CES 2017, Faraday Future showed off its newFF 91 electric vehicle. One prototype was shown parking itself in downtown Las Vegas via a live video feed. A second unit onstage performed a similar stunt.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe vehicle packsan incredible 1,050 horsepowerin its electric motors with high-density battery packs good for a class-leading 378-mile range. Bluetooth integration, a smartphone app and facial recognition cameras are key to everything from opening the doors to learning driver preferences.The Faraday Future FF 91 is equipped with more than 30 advanced sensors for autonomous driving, including cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors and a retractable Lidar unit.Taking Aim at TeslaThe comparisons to Tesla and its current line-up of premium electric vehicles showed that Faraday Future is hoping to steal some thunder - and some customers.Faraday Future claims its new car has the densest battery pack available, with 130 kilowatt-hours of energy. Tesla meanwhile, just introduced a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack in August, an optional upgrade to the 90 kilowatt-hour pack offered with the Model S starting in 2015. The higher density battery pack means the Faraday Future FF 91 gets superior range (378 miles compared to 315 miles for the Tesla) and faster speed. Faraday is also promising wireless charging is coming at some point.The Faraday Future FF 91 was pitted directly against a Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X in a race (which concluded offstage and wasn't independently verified). The Faraday Future FF 91 won,boasting a supposed new production car speed recordof 0 to 60 mph, at 2.39 seconds.Should Tesla be Worried?The Faraday Future FF 91 was at least a working automobile - unlike last year's stationary display model - but it's not quite ready for prime time.There were glitches, including an embarrassing moment whenthe car refused to start moving on stageduring a self-parking demonstration.Jalopnikalso noted assembly flaws and a reluctance to show the interior of the car,signs that the Faraday Future FF 91 isn't yet production-ready.Then there is the disastrous state of the company itself, described in a feature article inThe Vergeas""an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse.""If the company survives to begin production, asBusiness Insiderpointed out last year, the mere existence of Faraday Future can be seen as a boost to TSLA byadding to the electric car momentum. Additional players increase the odds that the overall electric car industry will survive its startup phase and thrive, something that is obviously good for Tesla. And from the appearances of the Faraday Future FF 91, the company is currently aiming at a premium market, while Tesla is pinning its future on mass production of the affordable Model 3.Car lovers with deep pockets can nowreserve an FF 91 for $5,000- and yes, the deposit is refundable should things not work out. The actual sales price was not announced.The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a     Make-or-Break StrategyThe bottom line? With the Faraday Future FF 91 demonstration at CES 2017, Faraday Future came a big step closer to having an actual product to sell. But the company is struggling, the prototype was imperfect and even if it does get its act together, it seems to be focused on the high end luxury market.Tesla shouldn't be sweating too much over this competition.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Won't Be Around a Year From     Now7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%     Upside in 2017The postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Has Nothing to Fear From Faraday Futureappeared first onInvestorPlace."

As Calpers Flails, Don’t Bank on Your Pension;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMillions of Americans are partially or wholly banking on some form of pension funds for retirement, whether they they work for a large corporation, a municipality or a given state. The problem is that many of these pensions - such as Calpers, which is the pension and health benefits system for well more than a million of California's public employees - are underfunded.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat's ""underfunded"" mean, exactly? It means many of these pension funds do not have adequate assets to pay out the full 100% of benefits due to their workers for the entire period of time they are projected to have to do so.That means that all government workers need to be aware that they cannot, and should not, assume their pension funds will provide for them in retirement.Instead, you need to have alternative plans in place, and that means investing on your own right now. Start learning the basics, and start setting money aside. (Andsign up for a stock advisory newsletter like The Liberty Portfolio, which I'll be launching shortly.)Calpers - the California Public Employees' Retirement System - has been in the news quite a bit this past year. Andbecause it is only 76% funded, it is a clarion call to government workers to wake up before it's too late. As theNew York Timesreports. Calpers is ""considering cutting its investment return assumption.""Ya think?The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New YearIn 2012, it cut the assumption by 0.25% to 7.5% annually, while returning 5.1% annually over the past 10 years, according to theNY Times. Last week, itdropped the expected returnsto 7%. Along with it, Calpers is monkeying around with what higher rates local governments are going to have to pay to get the $139 billion unfunded liability to go down. Employers may face a 30% to 40% increase in payments. That's just insane, because that money means more tax increases.Let's face it: Getting the unfunded liabilities down to zero will never happen. It's like any government program - once the debt or unfunded portion gets past a certain point, the ship has begun taking on water.So what can middle-aged employees do to anticipate a reduced pension payout?Invest.Investing on Your OwnThe investment approach will need to be different from that of the Calpers fund. Page 99 of the its financial report shows that ""your"" money is alreadyspread around many of the top equity namesalready:Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Johnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), just to name the top five.Without seeing a complete set of portfolio holdings, it is difficult to say where I think Calpers is underweighted inappropriately. However, considering the overall returns of the fund compared to theS&P 500 Indexand other benchmarks, it sure looks poorly managed overall.I tend to believe that most funds and managers are underweighted in value stocks, small caps and in preferred stocks. I think most are vastly overweighted, and wrongly so, in bonds. Preferred stocks and baby bonds (also known as exchange-traded debt) offer higher yields with comparable risk to government bonds.So what might be the best strategy if you are a Calpers pensioner? The first thing you need is more complete information.Go ahead and order the complete set of holdings. Hopefully they will break down the asset allocation in that filing. Asset allocation is crucial, because if you are middle-aged, getting the right balance is key. As for what actually is the right balance, that's something you have to decide yourself based on your risk profile. There are many ways of determining that.We certainly know that you need not invest in large cap stocks like AAPL, XOM, MSFT and the familiar names. No, my guess is you'll need small-cap value and growth names, or exchange-traded funds for that exposure. You'll need individual preferred stocks, which I think are better than the ETFs offered, and which I will discuss inThe Liberty Portfolio.The Dirty Secret to Trading Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) StockThese equity names and ETFs will expose you to a bit more risk, but I don't think you need to plow tons of capital into those names. I think that otherwise, prudent choices in preferred stocks, baby bonds and some real estate investment trusts should pay off over the long term.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Nothing Can Stop the Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Freight Train;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough many analysts are putting aqualified success anglefor this year's retail holiday season, there's no hiding the ugly truth - retail stocks are languishing.Source: ShutterstockSure, the Black Friday weekend got off to agreat start, but that has much to do with stores opening on Thanksgiving Day.makeArticleAd();Brick-and-mortar retailers are still finding it difficult to attract shoppers. The one bright spot is e-commerce. Unfortunately for everyone else, that is a domain becoming increasingly swallowed up byAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).A cursory look at major retail stocks gives you all the info you need to know. Shares ofWal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) have given up a significant portion of their post-election rallies.For the month of December, WMT slipped 1% below parity, while TGT fell by more than 7%. And it wasn't just discount retailers, either. High-end names such asNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) andWilliams Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) have absorbed horrible losses in the markets.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryEven AMZN stock was not immune from the pain. Since closing at an all-time high in early October, Amazon stock has given up more than 11%. Worse yet, shares didn't seem to gain much traction. While AMZN closed out the year up 11%, that may be little comfort to those who are assessing the nearer-term momentum. AMZN stock has been sandwiched between its 50- and 200-day moving averages for some time, suggesting pensiveness among the bulls.A Challenging Environment for AMZN StockI think anybody can appreciate the lack of confidence toward AMZN stock. Wall Street is about making profits, not pontificating about prior achievements. If there's one thing that can disrupt Amazon stock, it would be declining consumer sentiment. To that end,reduced advertisementsby retailers is a worrisome sign.Click to EnlargeThis is where hard data can help distinguish between either a natural correction for AMZN stock, or something more permanent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce is anunstoppable force.In the six years from 2000 through the end of 2005, online retail sales totaled $326.6 million. In last year alone, that figure jumped to $341.5 million. By default, this just feeds into the Amazon stock machine.But more so than the raw numbers, the growth rate in online retailing continues to impress. Of course, nothing will come close to the nascent years of e-commerce. In the 2000s, online sales grew annually by 21%. But over the past six years, the growth rate is still a robust 15%. Since all indications point to a superior performance in the fourth quarter of 2016, that rate is only going higher.This is simply great news for AMZN stock. Admittedly, though, its success is coming at great cost to the overall industry. Whiletotal retailsales exclusive of food services is a massive entity, the percentage of shoppers doing business online is skewing unfavorably for the brick-and-mortars.A prime example is the immediate fallout from the Great Recession. Retail overall saw negative growth in 2008 and 2009, particularly seriously during the latter. In contrast, e-commerce growth was hit hard, but never dipped into the red thanks to companies like AMZN. In addition, aggregate retail sales this decade average an anemic 4.5%.Amazon Demonstrates Why It's the BestI think we also need to acknowledge another basic reality - AMZN is a freak of nature. Despite difficult circumstances for its land-based competitors, the e-commerce giant finds new ways to leap above the fray. Case in point is the more thanone billion productsthat were pushed out the door due to its Prime and Fulfillment services. That has to be a major letdown for Amazon stock competitors, who are trying to find some way of remotely keeping pace.An even greater challenge is addressing the in-house sales that the Seattle-based company generates. Demand for the Echo speakers that are an accessory to Amazon's Alexa voice recognition software jumped nine fold from last year's holiday season. According to their senior management team, the Echo was flying off the shelf despite a significant boost in production. If there's just one reason to buy AMZN stock, that might be it.Finally, the most impressive element of the organization is that they haven't lost their hunger for innovation.Amazon Go- the firm's foray into the ultra-competitive grocery sector - is nothing short of astonishing. Layered with consumer-centric technologies that represents a paradigm shift in shopping, AMZN takes integration to a new level. Thus, an investment in AMZN stock is an investment into the future.The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a     Make-or-Break StrategyI can only come to one conclusion. Amazon stock is as sure of a long-term bet as anything else in the markets. Not only is it dominating its own industry, AMZN is disrupting others. It is both retailer and producer - and it does both things amazingly well.Finally, it has enough moxie and leverage to compete in utterly foreign sectors. Again, there's nothing out there quite like AMZN stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe postNothing Can Stop the Amazon.com, Inc.

This forced the company to recall the Karma drone.GPRO Stock Takes a BeatingGoing into the holiday shopping season, GPRO was facing a PR issue with its recalled Karma drone. It had no drones to sell, leaving consumers looking for big-ticket, high-tech gifts to buy the DJI Mavic instead.Following the Karma recall, the company was forced tolay off 200 employees(15% of its staff) and the company's president left amid the restructuring. Earnings were missed - badly - and GoPro stock took a beating.The company desperately needs some good news to kick off 2017.GoPro Karma Will Re-Launch in 2017Rather than demonstrate new products at the Consumer Electronics Show, GPRO is there ""demonstrating recent product breakthroughs."" The biggest breakthrough of all for the company is a resolution to the Karma drone crisis.GoPro chose CES 2017 to announce it willre-launch the Karma drone in 2017. According to GoPro, the issue that brought its drones out of the sky has been identified as ""power loss due to a mechanical issue related to securing the drone's battery.""GoPro says it has fixed the design flaw and is currently finishing up testing. It says further details will be provided in February outlining the plans for the GoPro Karma worldwide re-launch.2016 was not a great year for GPRO. Demand for action cameras softened even as additional competitors entered the market and smartphones began to emerge as a threat:Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) released a water-resistant iPhone 7 that could shoot 4K video and 120 frames per second slow motion 1080p video. There were manufacturing challenges with its new Hero5 camera and the Karma drone recall capped things off. After the dust settled, GoPro stock shed over 50% of its value in 2016.However, GPRO was able to sell the Karma Grip (handheld camera stabilizer) component of the Karma drone separately in time for Christmas, and the company reportedGoPro camera sales up 35% on Black Fridaycompared to the previous year.If it is able to successfully re-launch the GoPro Karma in 2017 it will have missed out on the 2016 holiday shopping season, but will have most of the year to build up sales and recognition leading into next Christmas.The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a     Make-or-Break StrategySince announcing the Karma drone re-launch, GoPro stock is up over 2.5%, reflecting the possibility that the company is finally putting a terrible 2016 behind it.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day     13 Things Apple Inc.

Why Tesla Motors, Inc. Stock Soared in December;1/5/2017;"What happenedShares of electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) soared 17.5% in December, according to data   provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's rise helped it recover some of its pullback earlier   in the year.The Tesla Model S. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();So whatThere's no surefire reason for Tesla's 17.5% gain during the   month, but one did stand out as the most likely catalyst for at   least a portion of the gain.Tesla stockhad pulled back in the weeks following the U.S. presidential   election, perhaps because investors were concerned about how   Tesla could be impacted during Trump's time as president. Trump   has expressed disbelief about global warming and outlined actions   for eliminating some government spending related to climate   change. But sentiment about how Tesla might fare with Trump as   president turned rosier when the president-elect startedcozying up to Elon Musk. Trump invited the Tesla CEO to his tech summit meeting in New   York City, and even appointed him to his Strategic and Policy   Forum.So, Tesla stock may have simply rebounded in December from a   sell-off spurred by an overreaction to Trump's election. Of   course, there were probably other factors driving the rebound,   such as theS&P 500's overall 2% gain during this period, but Trump's warming up to   Musk was likely one of the main catalysts for Tesla stock during   the month.Now whatInvestors shouldn't read too much into month-to-month moves   like this, but it is notable to see Trump keeping Musk close to   his side. Still, investors may want to keep an eye on any   political action during Trump's presidency that could impact   Tesla.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Just Showed Why It Still Has More Room to Run in 2017;1/5/2017;"Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining nearly 300%. As a result, nearly every portfolio manager and analyst is positive on the company, as its GPUs go into everything from artificial intelligence to machine learning to driverless cars.After Wednesday's CES 2017 keynote address by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, Wall Street might not be bullish enough.In awide rangingkeynote address that kicked off the annual consumer electronics extravaganza in Las Vegas that touched on everything Nvidia is doing, Huang had something for all of its partners, its investors and the media that covers the company.makeArticleAd();Perhaps the most impressive announcement was the ability to have high-powered gaming in the cloud, effectively making any PC or Mac a high-powered gaming machine that can run the latest and greatest video games. Bringing gaming to the Mac with GeForce Now, its cloud gaming service, should open a huge new market for Nvidia. Apple's Macs have traditionally never been good for gaming, which is the only area of the PC market that's experiencing growth, so this is a coup for Nvidia.At $25 for 20 hours of gaming, it's a lot cheaper than plunking down $1,500 or $2,000 on an expensive gaming machine, especially if your existing PC or Mac is suitable enough for the rest of your computing needs.This presents a huge opportunity for Nvidia. Right now, there are around 100 million high-end gaming PCs out there. With this announcement, the opportunity went up nearly 20 fold. ""From a [total addressable market] perspective, the company is targeting emerging markets which addresses a 2.8B population (ages 18-40),"" RBC Capital Markets analysts led by Mitch Steves wrote in a research note following the speech.If that wasn't enough, the company's major announcement of a partnership with Audi to have driverless cars on the road by 2020 should whet investor's proverbial whistles.In addition, Huang showed off Nvidia's new AI Car Platform, which it wants every car-manufacturer to use. Currently, Tesla (TSLA) isusingNvidia's chips for its self-driving system and we can expect many more car-makers to do the same thanks to Nvidia making it easier with its AI Car Platform.Automotive could be a bigger opportunity for Nvidia than gaming, thanks to the opportunities in the digital cockpit (which represents a 20 million car or $2 billion opportunity per Steves), self-driving cars (15 million or $2 billion) and transportation-as-a-service (2 million or $2-$6 billion. Self-driving cars are coming and they're coming fast, all thanks to the computing power and artificial intelligence prowess that Nvidia's GPUs can handle.There were several more announcements, including the smart home, but none of this is possible without the boom we've seen over the past couple of years in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Andreessen Horowitz analyst Benedict Evans has tweeted that the ""Age of the GPU"" started in 2015 and Nvidia is capturing every opportunity it can in these arenas.With a presentation spanning nearly two hours and covering every white-hot topic in Silicon Valley, Huang showed off why Nvidia's GPUs are the apple of Silicon Valley's eye (pun intended) and will be for years to come."

The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a Make-or-Break Strategy;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe new year is shaping up to be a make-or-break year for electric vehicle innovatorTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). That's because we finally get to see whether CEO Elon Musk's vision of a fully integrated clean-energy company - spanning production, storage and end-use of renewable energy - can come to fruition. Needless to say, TSLA stock holders will be watching with eyes as wide as dinner plates.Source:OnInnovation via FlickrLast year, the major piece of the puzzle was the bailout buyout of fellow Musk company,SolarCity. That deal will supposedly tuck in the generation part of the plan.makeArticleAd();But right now, the story is all about storage. Tesla finally flipped the switch on its massive battery production facility - dubbed the Gigafactory.Without it, there's no way Tesla Motors can deliver on its lofty long-term goals. Nor can the company support the lofty price on TSLA stock, either.The Gigafactory not just a battery farm. It's a critical piece of the Tesla Motors story.Tesla's Big Plans for Its Big GigafactoryLithium batteries make the world go 'round. Storage of energy is a key component in basically everything, from solar panels to your smartphone. And lithium battery production has long been dominated by Japan, China, and other southeast Asian nations;roughly 88%of the world's battery production comes from the region.Tesla's problem is an ambitious goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2018 … which will take a ton of lithium batteries. Current production isn't up to snuff, by alot. There's a significant shortfall.Like most Elon Musk solutions, Tesla's fix for its battery problem is a large one.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryA few years ago, TSLA partnered withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY) and started construction on a massive plant in the Nevada desert. The dubbed Gigafactory would design and build the needed batteries to arm itself - and potentially other vehicle makers, electrics firms and others - with the needed batteries to store energy. Over the spring, Musk and TSLA predicted that the facility would be able to crank outnearly 50 gigawatts worth of production by 2018- more than the world currently produces.On Wednesday, Tesla Motors turned on the third of the Gigafactory that is completed and started production of batteries.The Gigafactory Is CriticalThe Gigafactory's launch is a significant moment for TSLA stock, because it will help determine Tesla's ability to survive, and how healthy that survival will look.Without the Gigafactory, Tesla simply can't deliver on its EV production goals. The rest of the world does not make enough batteries, period. Plus, a lack of supply leads to another issue: affordability. The Model 3 is supposed to be an electric car for the masses that takes Tesla Motors from a hobby car for the rich to a staple for your average Joe.But current battery prices are too high to make the $35,000 vehicle profitable. And despite its cult stock following, Tesla still is a publicly traded company, and TSLA stock holders will increasingly demand profits.By building its batteries in-house, Tesla should be able to drive down costs for the critical component and make the Model 3 a profitable endeavor. One would hope so, considering that TSLA took out around$5 billion in debtto build the facility.Equally as important is TSLA's other plans for the facility. Musk & Co. are planning on building battery packs for energy storage from renewables and other sources. That includes its Powerwall and Powerpack batteries that store energy from its SolarCity and utility customers.This is a double-edged sword.Macy's Inc (M) Stock Plunges on Disastrous     Holiday Sales, Job CutsEven amid a shortfall in batteries, battery prices tanked last year. According toBloomberg's New Energy Finance unit, prices for lithium batteries sank by 22% in 2016 and are estimated to fall by another 15% this year. That's great for Model 3 profits and sales to utility customers, but not great for its actual battery production arm. If Tesla plans on selling its battery packs outside its doors - and it does based on its estimated production size and recent deals - then it needs to find the perfect price in the middle. Not too hot and not too cold.That needs to happen soon, too. The first things rolling off the Gigafactory line are storage batteries, not vehicle packs.This Is Everything to TSLA StockTesla's Gigafactory is a much-needed gamble. Without it, Musk can't achieve his vision of having an integrated clean energy company. Tesla will never be able to sell enough cars cost-effectively, get solar panels on everyone's roofs and provide energy storage for larger utility companies.Obviously, if it can't do that, TSLA stock is sunk. Tesla Motors already had enough mishaps on its own without SolarCity and the Gigafactory weighing it down under certain worse- and worst-case scenarios.Thus, the Gigafactory is a make-or-break strategy in a make-or-break year for Tesla Motors. If Tesla's past is any indication, things won't go perfectly smoothly - but they must go at least somewhat according to plan to keep TSLA from hurtling toward the earth.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Growth Stocks Set to Pop in 2017The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe postThe Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a Make-or-Break Strategyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

(DAL);1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are retreating this morning, as Wall Street takes a breather ahead of a wealth of economic data, including key employment reports. Specifically, the ADP private-sector payrolls report and weekly jobless claims are due out today, followed by December's non-farm payrolls report tomorrow. Meanwhile, the December purchasing manager's index is also due to hit the Street later this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave retreated 0.08%,S&P 500futures have fallen 0.14% andNasdaq-100futures have dropped 0.18%.On the options front, volume remained strong on Wednesday, with about 15.1 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio extended its recent decline to rest at 0.64, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.67.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) options traders are gearing up for next Friday's fourth-quarter earnings report. Meanwhile,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) came up short in full-year deliveries but was initiated at ""buy"" at Guggenheim, andDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) lifted its fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue.Bank of America Corp. (BAC)Ahead of the open next Friday, Bank of America will slip into the earnings confessional. Analysts are expecting a profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $20.99 billion - up 40% and 7.3% year-over-year, respectively. Expectations appear to be a bit higher, however, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of 39 cents per share for BofA earnings.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryOptions traders are also quite bullish on BAC stock. During Wednesday's trading, speculative traders pushed more than 673,000 contracts across the tape on BAC, with calls gobbling up 73% of the day's take. Among yesterday's most interesting trades, however, was what appeared to be a short-strangle at the January 2017 20 series $22.50 and $23 strikes.According toTrade-Alert.com, 10,000 contracts traded at each of the January $22.50 put and $23 call for the bid prices of 49 cents and 46 cents, respectively. Taking the trade at face value, the trader received a credit of 95 cents, or $95 per pair of contracts, which he will only keep if BAC stock closes between $22.50 and $23 when January options expire.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)Tesla had quite the busy day yesterday. The company said itdelivered about 22,000 carsin the fourth quarter, bringing 2016's total to 76,230 cars - short of the company's forecast for 80,000 to 90,000. But that data was overshadowed by Tesla's analyst day tour of its new gigafactory, which has nowbegun production. In response, analysts at Guggenheim initiated coverage on TSLA stock with a ""buy"" rating.Despite the wealth of bullish data, options traders appeared to focus more on deliveries, as calls only accounted for about 53% of the more than 331,000 contracts traded on TSLA yesterday. With Guggenheim providing thesecond such bullish research notein the past two weeks, something's got to give in TSLA's options backdrop sooner or later, especially with the shares closing in on heavy January 2017 call OI at the $230 strike.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Delta skies look a bit friendlier now, after the company lifted its fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue forecast yesterday. The news was followed by analysts at Cowen & Co. naming DAL stock a top pick while downgrading nearly all of Delta's peers.

Tesla Motors Inc.'s Misses Are Habitual, but So Is Its Mind-Boggling Growth;1/5/2017;"AfterTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported fourth-quarter deliveries below its own   guidance Tuesday after market close, investors seemed like they   couldn't care less about the miss. Indeed, if anything,   shareholders might have been happy to see production increasing   -- even if the company is underperforming its own ambitious   growth targets.Tesla stockwas up about 5% in late afternoon trading Wednesday.So, why is it that investors still seem pleased with Tesla's   recent performance, despite the company missing its own   targets?makeArticleAd();Tesla store. Image source: The Motley Fool.Small misses on increasingly bigger targetsFor its fourth quarter, Tesla delivered about 22,200 vehicles,   the company announced earlier this week. This put its total   deliveries for 2016 at 76,230 -- 3,770 vehicles below the bottom   of Tesla's initial full-year guidance range of  80,000 to   90,000 deliveries.Bad news right? Not necessarily. The narrative looks a bit   more optimistic when investors consider that Tesla delivered   under 50,700 vehicles in 2015. Its 2016 deliveries, therefore,   are up a notable 51% year over year.In a sense, the market seems to have gotten used to   Tesla's habit -- whether it's on purpose or not -- of   missing its big growth targets. And it's arguably becoming easier   to forgive the company given that it's still growing at a   blistering rate.To put Tesla's small misses into perspective, consider this   table of the company's actual annual deliveries versus initial   annual guidance for full-year vehicle deliveries during each   period.YearInitial GuidanceActual Vehicle DeliveriesDifference201320,00022,44212.2%201435,00031,655(9.6%)201555,00050,658(4.3%)201680,000-90,00076,230(10.3%)*Total195,000*180,985(7.2%)*Data from SEC filings and Tesla's quarterly press releases for   vehicle deliveries. * indicates a figure based on a guidance   range midpoint.Tesla is definitely underperforming its targets, but it's   still ramping up deliveries every year at consistently rapid   rates.Production, deliveries, and demand are soaringFurther, several metrics about Tesla's recent growth give   investors reason to be hopeful about the company's growth   trajectory. Consider some of these tidbits:It has increased deliveries at a rate of 41% or higher     during each of the last four years, with deliveries increasing     51% year-over-year in 2016.Data for chart based on SEC filings and Tesla's quarterly   press releases for vehicle deliveries. Chart source: author.Vehicle production in 2016 was up 64% year over year. (The     difference in delivery growth and production growth reflects     vehicles still in transit to customers at the end of Q4.)Demand is increasing sharply, with Q4 net orders for the     Model S and Model X at a record high, up 52% year over year and     24% sequentially.This recent growth, of course, still isn't quite enough to   eliminate watchers' well-justified skepticism toward the   company's ambitious target of achieving an annualized production   rate of 500,000 vehicles in 2018 with the help of the company's   planned Model 3 launch later this year. But when considering both   Tesla's recent growth and its estimated 400,000 deposit-backed   reservations for the lower-cost Model 3, it's definitely   beginning to look like the company could build and sell several   hundred thousand vehicles in 2018 -- and 500,000 doesn't sound as   crazy as it used to.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Options Traders Expect Huge Moves in Tesla (TSLA) Stock;1/5/2017;"Investors in Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAneed to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the January 20th, 2017 $50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together anoptions tradingstrategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tesla shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tesla is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Automotive - Domestic industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 56 cents per share to a loss of 72 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Tesla right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The Simple Reason I Won't Buy Tesla Motors Stock;1/4/2017;"Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source:OnInnovationvia Flickr. Copyright 2010 The Henry Ford. Republished underCC BY-ND 2.0.There is a simple reason I won't buy shares ofTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) : I don't trust founder-CEO Elon Musk.Let me explain. It's not that I think Musk is fundamentally   dishonest, but rather that his grand unifying vision for his   company has blinded him to his responsibility to minority   shareholders and to the risks he is asking them to bear. The   Tesla Motorsacquisition-rescueof SolarCity Corp. is all the evidence I need to support that   proposition.makeArticleAd();In a deal with as much potential for conflict of interest as   this one, I think Musk had a personal obligation to spell out the   enormous risks associated with the acquisition in a clear and   forthright manner, instead of letting the lawyers address them in   legalese in the pages of a securities filing. He didn't.A tangled webIf you're reading this article, I assume you're probably   familiar with the conflicts of interest I refer to above, but let   me recap the most obvious ones for those readers who aren't:Musk is the co-founder, chief executive, chairman and     largest shareholder of electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors,     with a 20.8% stake.Musk was also the chairman and largest shareholder of solar     power system manufacturer SolarCity.Lyndon Rive, SolarCity's then-CEO and board member, is     Musk's cousin. Rive's co-founder, his brother Peter Rive, was     SolarCity's chief technology officer and a board member.Allow me to draw on one of the lessons that 50 years of   stewardship ofBerkshire Hathawaytaught CEO Warren Buffett. As he wrote in his golden anniversary   annual letter (emphasis mine):Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of     Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were     destined to simply limp along.Mistakes of that kind are deadly... Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The     intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must     not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you     receive.A losing exchangeTesla gave away 0.11 of its shares for every SolarCity share.   Here is what I think they received in return, in terms of   intrinsic value: zero. That's what I think SolarCity is worth as   a going concern. It isn't profitable, either under GAAP   (generally accepted accounting principles) or on a cash basis.   The most recent estimates have SolarCity recording an accounting   loss of close to a billion dollars in 2017, following an   estimated $925 million loss in 2016.By the end of the third quarter of 2016, SolarCity's cash had   declined to $259 million from $373 million 12 months prior --   despite having issued debt and equity totaling $849 million (net   basis) over that period. Yet Teslatouted as a financial benefitof the acquisition that it ""is expected to be additive to Tesla's   cash balance... We expect SolarCity to add more than half a   billion dollars in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next 3   years."" Here's to wishing!Apparently, I'm not the only with genuine skepticism regarding   the equity value Tesla shareholders received in acquiring   SolarCity. In themerger proposalit filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 31,   Tesla revealed thatfifteeninstitutional investors had passed on acquiring SolarCity or even   simply making an equity investment in it, and that the company   was facing a liquidity squeeze. On its most recent financials,   the company's Altman Z-score of -0.20 indicated a significant   risk of bankruptcy.""[A] match made in market heaven""With the acquisition by Tesla, SolarCity has found a lifeline   such that financial distress is no longer imminent. However, to   justify the acquisition on any basis other than as a rescue   operation, you have to buy into Musk's vision of the rich   synergies between the two businesses. I don't. As New York   Universityfinance professor and valuation expert Aswath Damodaranwrotein September:I don't think that Tesla's Solar City acquisition passes     [either] the smell test (for conflict of interest) [or] the     common sense test (of creating value), but I am not a     shareholder in either Tesla or Solar City and I don't get a     vote. When Tesla shareholders vote, given that owning the stock     is by itself an admission that they buy into the Musk vision, I     would not be surprised if they go along with his     recommendations. Tesla shareholders and Elon Musk are a match     made in market heaven and I wish them the best of luck in their     life together.(Note: Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition on Nov. 17,   and the deal closed five days later.)Like Damodaran, I'm not a Tesla shareholder. I respect Musk   for his entrepreneurial vision and for what he has achieved, but   there is a fine line between visionary drive in emerging   industries and recklessness. As far as I'm concerned, buying or   holding Tesla Motors shares at this point has more to do with   blind faith than investing.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Gold prices held on   to their recent gains, too, and that produced a 2% increase for   the always volatileDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) .As for individual stocks,Weight Watchers(NYSE: WTW) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stood out with large price jumps even on a solid   day for broader indexes.Weight Watchers' brand glowWeight Watchers' stock gained 21% following two pieces of good   news for the brand. First, the companywon high marks in an annual diet-ranking   programperformed byU.S. News & World Report. The survey judged programs across categories like diabetes and   heart disease prevention, and easiness to follow. Weight Watchers   came in first within four categories, including ""Best Diet for   Fast Weight Loss.""Weight Watchers was tied for fourth-best overall, giving the   company good news to put in front of potential customers. ""We're   honored to be ranked at the highest level for seven straight   years by the experts atU.S. News & World Report,"" an executive said in a press release.Weight Watchers shares also appeared to benefit from news that   Oprah Winfrey, who recently took an ownership stake in the   company, is lending her considerable star power to promote the   brand. She gushed about the program on Tuesday, tellingThe Late Show's Stephen Colbert: ""Everybody who has watched me over the years   knows I've struggled with food. It's the first time that I've   gotten it under control.""The company has receivedsimilar endorsements by Oprah in the past, and it also routinely ranks well inU.S. News & World Report's surveys. It hasn't yet turned those branding wins into strong   membership and earnings growth, though. Revenue is down slightly   over the past nine months as operating income held flat at $150   million.Tesla deliveriesTesla shares jumped 4% after the electric-car makerupdated investorson its latest production and sales-output figures. The company   manufactured 24,882 vehicles in the fourth quarter despite   shifting to new autopilot hardware. Initial transition hiccups   meant that deliveries didn't quite meet expectations, though.   Tesla delivered 22,200 vehicles -- below the 25,000 goal -- in   the quarter, 12,700 of which were Model S, with the remaining   9,500 being Model X.Executives said that short-term production challenges were to   blame for the delivery shortfall.

The 6,500   vehicles that were in transit when the clock ran out on the   quarter will count toward first-quarter deliveries.Image source: Tesla.Investors took that slight miss in their stride, choosing   instead to focus on Tesla's bullish reading of the market in a   quarter that included a 52% spike in order volume.

Why Tesla Motors' Guidance Misses Should Concern Investors;1/4/2017;"Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) said that it delivered about 22,200 vehicles in   the fourth quarter of 2016, a number that left it short of its   own guidance for both the quarter and the full year.It's far from the first time that Tesla has missed its own   guidance, of course. Investors appeared to take this latest   shortfall in stride. But the trend suggests that Tesla might miss   some key deadlines, and that could have much more serious   consequences for the stock.""Short-term production challenges""Tesla's guidance had called for ""just over 25,000"" deliveries   in the fourth quarter and at least 80,000 for the full year. But   its fourth-quarter shortfall left its tally for the full year at   76,230 vehicles delivered to customers.makeArticleAd();Now in its fifth year of production, Tesla's Model S may be   facing declining demand. Image source: Tesla Motors.In a statement late on Tuesday, Tesla said that ""short-term   production challenges starting at the end of October and lasting   through early December"" left it scrambling to make up lost   production late in the quarter.Tesla blamed the ""challenges"" on its transaction to install   new hardware for its Autopilot driver-assist system. The company   said on October 19 that it would begin shipping all of its new   vehicles with thehardware necessary for fully autonomous   driving, allowing it to gradually enable self-driving capabilities in   those cars with software updates over time.Tesla last reaffirmed its fourth-quarter guidance in a   shareholder letter on October 26. Apparently, the ""production   challenges"" started in the days immediately following the   letter.Another in a long list of missed goalsTesla has a long history of missing its own targets, whether   for sales totals, profits, or the timing of key product-related   events. CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that the company sometimes   falls short, saying that he sets ambitious goals for the company   as a way to motivate employees and suppliers.That may work, but it makes it challenging for investors to   evaluate the company's stated business plans. Musk has said that   Tesla will begin production of its compact Model 3 sedan sometime   in 2017, but many analysts feel that's unlikely.In a note on Tuesday before Tesla announced its delivery   totals,Barclaysauto analyst Brian Johnson said that there's a high probability   that the company won't be able to deliver any Model 3s in   2017.Why Tesla's routine misses could eventually be trouble for   the stockViewed in the context of its past results, Tesla's 2016   delivery total is impressive even if it fell short of Musk's   goal. But it's still far short of the hundreds of thousands -- or   millions -- of annual deliveries that Tesla will need to be a   viable automaker over the long term.Tesla has said that it has nearly 400,000 preorders for the   Model 3. But more and more big automakers are announcing plans to   bring long-range electric vehicles to market over the next few   years. (Just yesterday,Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) said that it will begin production of anelectric SUV with 300 miles of rangeby 2020.)If the Model 3 is delayed, which seems likely given Tesla's   history, that could mean that those orders won't be filled until   late 2018 or 2019. How many of those customers will give up and   choose an electric vehicle from a major automaker instead?Tesla had a significant technological advantage over the big   automakers when it first launched the Model S in 2012. But the   risk to Tesla as an investment has always been that the big   automakers might close the electric-vehicle technology gapbefore Tesla can get to sustainable scale, leaving the upstart Silicon Valley automaker in an uphill   battle for market share against better-funded competition.That risk could become reality if the Model 3 is delayed   significantly. Tesla has built a great brand and the Model 3   will find buyers no matter what happens. But the longer it waits,   the harder it will be for Tesla to ramp up to the millions of   deliveries a year that it will need to support its current   sky-high valuation.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla's Gigafactory Doubles in Size, Brings Battery Cell Production to U.S.;1/4/2017;"When ItouredTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory in July, it was  already a   massive structure. With an 800,000-square-foot footprint and 1.9   million square feet of manufacturing space when including the   building's several levels, the factory would take hours to walk   through. Even more, the company had already tooled significant   portions of the factory and had begun streamlining production of   Tesla Energy packs (the cells used in the packs were still made   in Japan).Tesla's Gigafactory (with Model 3 sitting outside) when I   visited last July. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();But a tour of the Gigafactory today would reveal some massive   changes. First, in less than six months, the building's total   footprint has doubled to 1.9 million square feet and its   operational square feet is 2.6 times what it was, at 4.9 million   square feet. Second -- and perhaps more important for Tesla's   business -- the company has already begun mass production of   lithium-ion battery cells at the factory.Building battery cells""Today at the Gigafactory, Tesla and Panasonic began mass   production of lithium-ion battery cells,"" Tesla announced in a   blog post on Wednesday.Tesla said it will be mass producing its new high-performance   cylindrical ""2170 cell,"" which CEO Elon Musk has said is both the   highest energy density cell in the world and is also the   cheapest.Production of battery cells for qualification purposes started   at the Gigafactory last month, the company said. But today's   production is meant for Tesla's energy storage products,   including its Powerwall 2 and its Powerpack 2 energy storage   products. And Model 3 is up next, with cell production for the   vehicle's batteries scheduled to begin in Q2.Tesla's ability to quickly expand production from energy   storage packs to battery cells for energy storage products and   its Model 3 continues to highlight the company's aggressive and   unique construction approach of building the Gigafactory in   phases so that Tesla,Panasonic, and other Tesla partners can begin manufacturing immediately in   finished sections.""Our phased approach also allows us to learn and continuously   improve our construction and operational techniques as we   continue to drive down the cost of energy storage,"" the company   explained.Tesla Gigafactory as of Jan. 3, 2016. Image source: Tesla   Motors.The beginning of cell production at Tesla's Gigafactory is   good news for investors. With Tesla planning to launch its   lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 in the second half of 2017, the   company will need Gigafactory-based cell production both for its   lower cell costs and its higher-volume cell production.Model 3 will likely be the most American-made     carOne interesting takeaway from this news is that by bringing   cell production to the U.S., Model 3 will likely become the   world's most American-made vehicle. After Tesla brings cell   production from Japan to the U.S. for its vehicles, the   percentage of content in its vehicles made in the U.S. could jump   from around 55% to around 90% -- a figure that would give Model 3   more American-made content than any other vehicle.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Furthermore, Tesla's narrative of U.S. job creation is   arguably an important factor as President-elect Donald Trump   takes office. Tesla's emphasis on U.S. job creation will likely   resonate with one of the president's biggest priorities: boosting   U.S.-based manufacturing. Musk has said the Gigafactory will   directly employ around 10,000 people at peak production, and   Tesla estimates the factory will indirectly create between 20,000   to 30,000 additional jobs in surrounding regions.For Tesla, this is just the beginning. The company reminded   investors today that while Gigafactory construction has   progressed by leaps and bounds, the factory is less than 30%   done. Tesla's ambition for the factory is enormous. By 2018, it   plans to produce about 35 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion battery   cell capacity per year, or about as much as the rest of the   world's battery production combined today. And when the structure   is complete, the Gigafactory will be the biggest building in the   world measured by footprint.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

CES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day 1;1/4/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year's edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) doesn't officially start until Jan. 5, but tech companies spent yesterday showing off their latest products to the press.Source: AcerAmong the stars of CES 2017 so far are laptops featuringIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) new Kaby Lake processors, smart home devices and the appearance of an actual functioningFaraday Futureelectric car.makeArticleAd();Today, we look at the most exciting headlines from Big Tech's meetings with the press.CES 2017: New CPUs Advance Mobile and PC CapabilitiesFor a while there, computing ambition was being held back by the wait for new processors. Intel's new ""Kaby Lake"" CPUs were unveiled at CES 2017, and that's good news for the PC industry. These seventh-generation chips are expected to power everything from thelong-awaited new iMacfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) to a new crop of VR-capable PCs and ultra-portable laptops.New computers were unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show that take advantage of the new Kaby Lake silicon, including a new convertible 2-in-1 version ofDell'spopularXPS 13 laptop. And in typical CES fashion, there was an over the top moment whenAcer Inc(OTCMKTS:ASIYF) took the wraps off thePredator 21-X: a $9,000-plus gaming ""laptop"" with a 21-inch curved display, Kaby Lake CPU, mechanical keyboard, dual graphics cards fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) and eye-tracking cameras.Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) also showed off its new Snapdragon 835 processor. You can expect to see the new flagship Snapdragon chip powering 2017's must-have Android smartphones.The Smart HomeMuch of CES 2017 has been focused on the smart home. That includes a flood of new mesh routers that aim to simplify home Wi-Fi and provide the wireless coverage need for smart homes to function effectively. They'll be taking on the like ofAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently announced Google WiFi system.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in     2017Also featuring prominently were smart speakers. Google Home is gaining the ability to remote start supported cars fromHyundai Motor Co(OTCMKTS:HYMLF).Lenovo Group Limited(OTCMKTS:LNVGY) showed off anew smart speakerthat incorporatesAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa smart assistant - an Amazon Echo alternative that looks better and costs less than the Amazon Echo. There's also a premium audio version that will go for $179.Alphabet Soup! QLED 4K HDR TVsTVs always make the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show, and Day One of CES 2017 did not disappoint. The big trend is in big-screen, QLED 4K HDR TVs.What exactly do all those acronyms mean?QLED combines two of TV's bleeding edge display technologies: quantum dots and OLED. Together, you get a picture that's brighter, with the deep blacks and flexible panels of OLED, but at a much more affordable cost. 4K is the the same Ultra HD resolution that has become an expected feature of TVs. HDR is the high-dynamic-range picture that makes viewing pop. Throw those letters all together, and you get a new class of QLED 4K HDR TVs that offer the best showcase technology of the past few years in a single and relatively affordable package.Leading that charge to convince you to finally buy a new TV were the usual suspects, includingSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Although this year, Samsung avoided controversy by refusing to give out prices for its newflagship QLED TVs.CES 2017: Faraday FutureThe Consumer Electronics Show has increasingly been focused on cars. Automobiles are rapidly getting more advanced - electric power, autonomous capabilities and integration with smart tech like Apple Car Play or Amazon Alexa - so that makes sense.The big story on the auto front from CES 2017 was the Faraday Future FF 91, a high-performance electric car that hopes to take onTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). Although Faraday promised a Tesla-killer at last year's show, it only managed a non-functioning prototype.The Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone WAS the Most     Popular Smartphone, But…This year, the company kicked off CES 2017 with live demonstrations of its Faraday Future FF 91, showing its self-driving capabilities while bragging about new high-density battery packs and world-record speeds.All of this is just skimming the surface of what was announced on day one.

The Dirty Secret to Trading Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;1/4/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'll get right into it - the dirty secret ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is that, despite all of the controversies and fanfare, TSLA stock has mostly been range-bound for the past three years.Source: ShutterstockIf you see a price below $200 per share as a buy signal, and a price near $250 as a sell signal, or even a sign to go short, you have been making money off Elon Musk right along. The turns in the stock's price are often sharp - it plunged from $240 to $150 about a year ago, then hit $250 again within two months - but they generally stay within the range.makeArticleAd();At the opening price of about $213.44, then, Tesla is clearly in ""meh"" territory. An uptrend has been in place for a month now, but if you jump in you're likely to see a reversal after a gain of about 10%.What's Up With TSLA Stock Now?The main problem for Teslaremains what it has always been, scaling production to meet the stock price's expectations.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearFor the third quarter in four for 2016,Tesla missed its production estimates, delivering just 22,200 cars. The original estimate for the year had been 80,000 to 90,000 cars. The final number was 76,230. That compares with50,580 for 2015, so 2016 production showed a more than 50% increase.Tesla continues to paint a rosy production picture, and CEO Elon Musk thinks it will deliver 800,000 cars next year. This will include the Model 3, a $35,000 unit on which 400,000 pre-orders (with $1,000 checks) were taken on its announcement.The cars are certain to be cool. The question is whether there will be enough of them to show a profit and please Wall Street.What If Musk Is Right?The production shortfall sent the shares down about $4, but they should go right back up today as the company offers investors a tour of its Sparks, Nevada battery""gigafactory,""hosted by Musk himself. The Nevada factory supplies batteries for Tesla cars and stand-alone PowerWalls that can store electricity produced by SolarCity solar panels.It is this production ramp-up that has both bulls and bears worried. If Tesla continues to fall short this year, the bears think the stock will collapseonce and for all. If it comes close to its goals then, adding in the Supercharging centers (on which it's finally going tostart making money this year), the PowerWalls and the solar panels, the thought is the bulls may run again.SolarCity, which Teslaformally acquired in November, was last year's reason to worry. The concern was that the solar panel maker would drag the whole company down with it. Since oil prices are now rising, SolarCity should soon see positive margins, especially as it's sold alongside other Tesla products, so that worry is passing.But whenever a worry passes with Tesla, a new worry replaces it. Maybe if Musk's production plans seem about to fail, he'll buy SpaceX. Or, if they seem about to succeed, he'll geta white Persian cat.Tesla Is a Trade and a TeaseFor analysts and reporters, Tesla is the gift that keeps on giving. In a black suit and blue tie world, Elon Musk and Tesla are a tie-dyed shirt. The story is always fun and always subject to change without notice.But beneath the hype, and the talk of imminent catastrophe or unlimited profit, lies this truth. Musk is building a real company, but he may never let the stock get out of its trading range, because once Tesla accomplishes a goal he will find it loftier goal that will worry analysts about his sanity, and that of his investors.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the     Cure Is ComingThus, if you're going to get involved in Tesla shares, and I'm not recommending you do unless you like some manic-depression with your morning coffee, just watch the trading range. Get in when they're bearish, get out when they're bullish, and on days like today when it's in-between, just have a laugh.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

However, its own forecast was for a range of 80,000   to 90,000 cars. Said Tesla in a press release:""Our Q4 delivery count should be viewed as slightly   conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is   transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.""When combining Q4's tally with the 24,500 vehicles in Q3,   Tesla also fell short of its half-year expectation for 50,000   vehicle deliveries.That said, Q4 still was an improvement over the previous year   by about 5,000 cars, and its production tally for 2016 was 64%   better year-over-year.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksWhile the initial reaction in TSLA stock was much more   violent, losses had pared their way down to about 1% of red ink   in Wednesday's early trade.Agile Therapeutics Inc (AGRX)AGRX shares were more than halved in Wednesday's premarket   trade, in addition to 12%-plus losses on Tuesday, following the   release of data from a study on the company's contraceptive   patch.Agile's Twirla contraceptive patch actually achieved positive   results, with the company's 13-cycle trial achieving a 4.8 rating   on subjects 35 years of age and under.

Tesla Misses Full-Year Vehicle Delivery Projections;1/3/2017;"Shares of Tesla MotorsTSLAfell in after-hours trading Tuesday following the company's Q4 and full-year vehicle delivery announcement. Tesla said that it delivered about 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 76,230 for the year, which missed estimates.The automaker said that ""short-term production challenges"" caused issues which weighted deliveries towards the end of the quarter and forced the company to miss its already-trimmed projections. Tesla delivered 12,700 Model S vehicles and 9,500 Model X vehicles in the quarter, and another 6,450 vehicles were in transit to customers are the end of the quarter.Tesla also highlighted the transition to new Autopilot hardware and some shipping challenges as difficulties in the quarter.In February, Tesla guided for deliveries of 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles in 2016, but that was later adjusted down to 79,000. The electric vehicle maker affirmed that guidance in October.Nevertheless, Tesla pointed out that vehicle demand in the quarter was strong, and net orders for the Model S and X were up 52% year-over-year.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Vehicle Deliveries Miss Guidance -- What Investors Should Know;1/3/2017;"Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter deliveries were below the   company's guidance, making it the third quarter during 2016 in   which the company missed its own target for vehicle deliveries.   The quarter's miss also put the company below its guidance for   the full year. Ahead of its planned Model 3 launch late this   year, another missed target does little to help investors have   faith in the company's much more ambitious goals for the upcoming   higher-volume, lower-cost car.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Another missTesla delivered about 22,200 vehicles during the quarter, the   company announced on Tuesday. The Model S accounted for 12,700   deliveries, and the Model X accounted for 9,500. This brought   total deliveries in 2016 to 76,230. Tesla had guided for ""just   over 25,000 deliveries"" during the fourth quarter. And management   had initially expected to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles in   2016 but ended up reducing its full-year guidance to about   79,000.Tesla explained the miss in a press release:Because of short-term production challenges starting at the     end of October and lasting through early December from the     transition to new Autopilot hardware, Q4 vehicle production was     weighted more heavily toward the end of the quarter than we had     originally planned. We were ultimately able to recover and hit     our production goal, but the delay in production resulted in     challenges that impacted quarterly deliveries, including, among     other things, cars missing shipping cutoffs for Europe and     Asia. Although we tried to recover these deliveries and     expedite others by the end of the quarter, time ran out before     we could deliver all customer cars.These deliveries are lower than the 24,821 units Tesla shipped   in Q3, but they were up 27% sequentially.The silver liningTo go along with Tesla's disappointing fourth-quarter   deliveries, the company gave investors a couple positive   takeaways from the quarter.First, production did pick up meaningfully during the quarter,   after the company addressed short-term production challenges.   Tesla was able to produce 24,822 vehicles in Q4, bringing total   2016 production to about 84,000 vehicles -- up an impressive 64%   from 2015. With production ramping steeply toward the end of the   company's fourth quarter, Tesla closed the year with a record   6,450 vehicles in transit to customers. These in-transit   deliveries will be delivered in the first quarter of 2017.Second, Tesla said demand during the quarter ""was particularly   strong."" Combined net orders for its Model S and X were 52%   higher than in the year-ago quarter and 24% higher than in   Tesla's third quarter of 2016.Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. Image source: The Motley   Fool.Despite a quarter-end rebound in production and higher demand,   Tesla's extension of its poor track record with hitting targets   in 2016 shouldn't be overlooked. Consistently missing its own   targets, including management's initial and revised full-year   delivery targets and three of its quarterly guidance targets,   makes Tesla's plan to go from its current annualized production   run rate of 100,000 units to a target of 500,000 units in 2018   difficult to take seriously.On the other hand, investors could benefit from zooming out of   the quarter's results and look instead at how rapidly the company   was able to increase full-year production compared with 2016. A   64% year-over-year increase in production during 2016 helps   reinforce the company's ability to grow production at an uncanny   rate, and it bodes well for future growth. But a 500,000   annualize unit-build rate still seems speculative -- even if the   company has 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the Model 3.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Electric Minivan: A Huge Missed Opportunity;1/3/2017;"FCA's Chrysler Portal concept is a futuristic take on a   vehicle for families, but it's just for show. FCA has no plans to   build it. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) has released some information on the Chrysler Portal   concept car that it plans to unveil on Tuesday at the Consumer   Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.makeArticleAd();The Portal is a futuristic take on a highly connected electric   minivan. It's an intriguing idea. But it's also a huge missed   opportunity -- and a troubling sign for FCA investors.A potential Tesla competitor, if it were realFCA said that the Portal ""explores the possibility of what a   family transportation vehicle could look like."" It has some   self-driving capabilities, FCA said, and the ability to connect   to personal devices and ""the cloud"" in ways that will help to   keep the kids entertained on long (or not so long) trips.FCA said that the Portal has a battery-electric drivetrain   with 250 miles of range. Its battery packs are built into the   floor, in the style ofTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) . Fast-charging capability will be able to add 150   miles of range in about 20 minutes.Simply put, the Portal represents an intriguing and advanced   potential competitor to Tesla's Model X, one that could turn the   market for ""kid-hauler"" vehicles on its head.Or it would, if FCA planned to build it. But the Portal is   strictly a show car -- and that's the problem.This isn't the electric minivan FCA desperately needsHere's why it's a problem: The auto industry is changing   rapidly, but there are few signs that FCA is taking steps to keep   up. This show vehicle doesn't really change that, but an electric   vehicle intended for production might have.Right now, FCA has pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs and Hemi V8s,   along with a nice new minivan. (And, to be fair, a brand-new   hybrid version of that minivan.) They're popular products and   sales have been good. But with no hybrids or electric vehicles to   offset them and improve its corporate fuel-economy average, FCA   is headed for trouble.The Portal's dash is a show-car flight of fancy. Image source:   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.FCA does have a deal withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo self-driving car subsidiary   that has produced someself-driving test vehiclesand a version of FCA's touchscreen system that integrates the   Android operating system. But it's lacking a range of hybrids and   a serious electric-car effort as fuel-economy rules tighten --   and that's going to be a big problem in a few years.The contrast with FCA's old Detroit rivals is instructive.General Motors(NYSE: GM) has a long-range electric carin productionand a massive effort under way to develop self-driving technology   in-house.Ford(NYSE: F) also has a big self-driving development effort under   way, along with a range of well-regarded hybrids and clear,   credible plans to add many more electrified vehicles over the   next few years. And both have made it clear that they are   grappling seriously with the larger technology-driven changes   coming to the business of autos.Chrysler wouldn't have missed this huge opportunity, but FCA   didNot all of the incumbent global automakers will be able to   make the leap into the not-too-distant electrified, self-driving,   ride-hailing future. Some will be displaced (or ""disrupted"") by   new entrants like Tesla and Waymo. It's a good bet that GM and   Ford will be important players in that future, because they're   taking the steps to get there now. FCA, which is struggling under   a huge debt load, hasn't kept up.A fully electric version of the Chrysler Pacifica would   have been a more impressive statement by FCA. Image source:   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.At several points in its long and checkered history, the old   Chrysler Corporation was able to dodge corporate death with a   brilliant new product at just the right moment. FCA had the   opportunity to do that today -- and frankly, when he heard that   an electric minivan was in the works, your humble Fool expected aclassic Chrysler masterstroke.Imagine if instead of a futuristic concept, FCA had shown a   long-range electric version of itscurrentminivan, the gorgeous Chrysler Pacifica -- and had announced   plans to put it into production. Sure, it might take a few years   and a huge internal effort to bring that vehicle to market, given   that FCA is starting from behind. But it would have the potential   to be the first electric vehicle that really connects with the   mass market: an electric minivan perfect for tech-savvy young   families.An electric Pacifica would have been a much more powerful   statement that FCA sees the future coming andplans to join itin bold style. Instead, it built a vehicle that is just for show,   with technology that might or might not actually exist. That also   makes a statement, and not a good one.10 stocks we like better than Fiat Chrysler     AutomobilesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

(AAPL)According to theNikkei Financial Daily,Apple is cutting iPhone productionby 10% in the 2017 January-March quarter. While Apple has offered   no comment on the report, theNikkeisays it has arrived at this conclusion by checking third-quarter   supplier data. That said, the cut isn't as deep as the 30% cut   for the same period in 2016.7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%       Upside in 2017AAPL stock immediately reacted by selling off nearly 0.8% on   Friday. The shares were already feeling a bit top heavy after   hitting resistance in the $1116-$118 region - an area that had   provided support for Apple stock in October.In the options pits, AAPL options traders backed away from   call activity on Friday. Total volume rose to 906,000 contracts   for Apple, with calls only accounting for about 53% of the day's   take - well below AAPL's usual call range of 63%-64%. Overall,   put open interest has crept higher on Apple stock during the past   several weeks, with the total January put/call OI ratio rising to   its current perch at 0.79, indicating a growing concern that AAPL   stock could meet with short-term weakness.Bank of America Corp (BAC)BAC enters 2017 riding high on promises for loosening   regulations from President-elect Donald Trump and three interest   rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in 2017. While evidence of   both remain to be seen, this hasn't stopped Bank of America stock   speculators from ramping up bullish activity in the shares.

The shares rallied more than 12% in   December to challenge resistance at $220 once again.TSLA's pullback to $215 at the end of the month prompted a   bullish note from analysts at Baird, which named Tesla a top pick   for 2017.According to Baird, ""TSLA's energy storage business and growth opportunity is not   currently reflected in share prices.""

Can Tesla Stock Drive 60 Percent Higher in 2017?;1/3/2017;"The continuous pattern of stop-and-go in shares of Tesla (TSLA) was frustrating to watch in 2016. But one prominent Wall Street analyst believe the company not only will turn things around in 2017, Tesla will deliver some 60% returns.Shares of the electric vehicle company ended last year's campaign down about 11%, trailing not only the Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQ), but also both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index. And much of Tesla's 2016 struggles was caused by the company's inability to make good on some promises, including its own vehicle production and delivery estimates. And to say nothing about the headache CEO Elon Musk caused by spending $2.6 billion to acquire SolarCity -- a deal Wall Street collectively hated.Can things change in 2017? Ben Kallo, analysts at Baird, who added Tesla as a 2017 best-pick candidate, thinks so. While citing the company's upcoming Model 3 and what he thinks is an undervalued energy storage business, Kallo last Friday slapped Tesla stock with Outperform rating and a $338 price target. Tesla shares closed Friday at $213.69, suggesting a potential premium of almost 60%.makeArticleAd();""We think the ramp of Tesla Energy and Model 3 production could exceed expectations during 2017, and believe the opportunity is not currently reflected in share price,"" Kallo wrote last Friday. ""We believe Tesla battery sales are accelerating, and we should see additional benefits from the battery production ramp coinciding with the launch of the Model 3.""Calling Kallo's price target ""overly optimistic"" would be a gross understatement. Tesla shares have a consensus target of $236, which is 30% below Kallo's estimate and suggests only a 10% increase from current levels. Tesla, nonetheless, ended 2016 on a strong note. Despite the 11% decline last year, the shares drove about 5% higher in the last three months of the year, posting 14.37% gains just in the last thirty days.Indeed, Elon Musk still has a lot to prove. He's promised that Model 3 deliveries will begin in 2017. For that to happen, Tesla needs cash to fund its aggressive production and delivery targets. Musk must also fully integrate SolarCity, which -- in its own right -- has struggled with profitability. To the extent Tesla's own cash-burn rate can fund both operations and meet its delivery forecasts remains to be seen.But as with Kallo, it's tough to bet against Musk and against Tesla stock. Assuming the company does reach its delivery target and begins Model 3 production this year, Tesla stock should regain its 2016 high of around $270, posting some 25% returns in 2017. While it's not 60%, it's not bad either.loadGallery({

Tesla Motors, Inc. Gives Potential Customers 2 Reasons to Buy Today;1/3/2017;"Image source: The Motley Fool.Going into 2017, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  is pulling a couple of levers to help boost   demand for its vehicles. On Jan. 1, the company said in a tweet   it is extending its deadline for buying a Tesla vehicle with free   lifetime Supercharging from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15.makeArticleAd();If you couldn't finalize your purchase by 12/31, you can still   order a Model S or X until 1/15 to receive unlimited   Supercharging.- Tesla (@TeslaMotors)January 1, 2017Tesla said in November it would end a current benefit for   Tesla buyers of getting lifetime, unlimited access to its   Supercharger network for long-distance travel. Teslas ordered   after Jan. 1, the company had said, would only include 400   kilowatt-hours of free Supercharging (roughly 1,000 miles) and   would have to pay a small fee to Supercharge beyond this   limit.The economics of charging a small fee for Supercharging beyond   approximately 1,000 miles a year would enable Tesla to ""reinvest   in the network, accelerate its growth and bring all owners,   current and future, the best Supercharging experience,"" the   company said in a blog post.But by extending the offer by two weeks, Tesla apparently   wants to give customers a bit more time to take advantage of   it.Tesla also said this weekend that it is delaying an imminent   5% price increase for U.K. customers, citing ""exceptionally high   demand,"" according to a statement Tesla provided toBloomberg.Does it matter?A two-week extension of these offers for Tesla buyers won't   likely make a meaningful difference in Tesla's first-quarter   deliveries, but the moves do suggest the two catalysts are   serving the company well in the near term. Overall, however,   investors should refrain from reading too much into news like   this.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Don’t Expect Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock to Sit Idle in 2017;1/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs 2017 the yearTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) motors higher once more … or will TSLA stock crash and burn? Let's take a look at the contentious battleground stock both off and on the price chart, and then we'll present a trading strategy based on the evidence.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)After nearly three years of volatile but stalled price action, Tesla shares are probably due to make a meaningful move. The fact is despite a consistent barrage of negative and positive calls on TSLA stock, shares are idling near $215 - a level first hit back in February 2014.makeArticleAd();What's more, while volatile at times, TSLA has been largely stuck in a lateral price range for most of this period. The lengthy technical congestion should be nearing its conclusion, and a capitulation (for either the bulls or the bears) looks to be in the cards.For the bulls, most recently, Baird & Co. is of the mind that 2017 will pay big dividends for Tesla stock holders. Not only did the firm maintain a lofty price target of $338 (almost 60% higher!), but on Friday it named TSLA stock its best pick for the New Year.Baird anticipates Tesla will surprise naysayers and bring to market its Model 3 in 2017. It also sees the company capitalizing on a hidden gem in itsunder-the-radar energy storage business.On the other end of the spectrum, Tesla has its share of bears putting their money where their mouths are. Short interest is approaching a large 40% of TSLA stock's float, with arguments for TSLA to crash lower running the gamut.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksFor the doom-and-gloom crowd, there's concerns over the 2016 acquisition ofSolarCity Corpand how its integration and increased debt load will impact Tesla. Some bears also worry Q4 sales will invariably come in weaker-than-forecast following an aggressive Q3 campaign.Another concern? Following a $2 billion secondary offering in 2016, bears anticipate Tesla will need to tap the equity markets again in 2017 due to continued losses and cash burn.And lastly, increased EV competition from auto heavyweights likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) is another factor that could weigh on TSLA stock … and perhaps its ability to remain an ongoing business.Tesla Stock ChartClick to EnlargeTSLA has more or less been motoring around laterally for the better part of the last three years. The duration sets the stock up to break free of the technical consolidation and move into a more defined bullish uptrend or bearish downtrend in 2017.If I were to take my best guesstimate of which direction has the edge, I'd give the advantage to the bulls. That is, if TSLA stock can hold near current levels and reverse higher above $223.80.If this scenario plays out, shares should effectively hold the 200-day simple moving average and the mid-congestion support line shown in the chart. Successful testing would help confirm the bull case, while a subsequent rally through Tesla's recent high would be evidence of building price momentum and perhaps a bullish trend to emerge in 2017.How to Trade TSLA Stock HereOne catalyst that could jump-start a Tesla in 2017 is the company'sJan. 4 Gigafactory tour. That said, I like the TSLA Mar $230/$250 bull call spread as a limited-risk play right now.With Tesla shares at $213.69, the vertical is priced at $5.10 and stands to gain up to $14.90, or nearly 300%, in the event shares can trade above $250 by March expiration. Our preference is to either exit or adjust the position as Tesla stock begins to move in either price direction, rather than passively hold the position.Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is a Must-Watch in     2017On the downside, if TSLA stock fails to hold above $210, the lower-delta vertical could be exited for an estimated loss of 75 cents to perhaps $1 rather than potentially losing the full debit.And if shares of Tesla begin to drive higher?Adjust the vertical's risk by selling some of the position or offsetting the bull call spread with a bear call spread to form a low-risk butterfly spread with a very attractive and substantial profit range.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

3 Stocks I Won't Be Selling In 2017;1/1/2017;"Oftentimes, portfolio performance can benefit fromlackof action. In other words, investors may be better off simply   leaving their stocks alone, and not worrying about timing the   market to buy and sell at the right times.""We continue to make more money when snoring than when   active,"" famed investor Warren Buffett has said. On a similar   note, he has said, ""Our favorite holding period is forever.""With this important investment principle in mind, here are   three stocks in my portfolio I almost certainly won't be selling   in 2017:Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Tesla Motors:Tesla is likely the riskiest stock of these three. But selling   before the automaker launches its lower-costModel 3, which ultimately represents the realization of the company's   ""master plan"" laid out over 10 years ago, could be a mistake.   While the stock's valuation has undoubtedly alreadypriced in expectations for extraordinary   growth, 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the highly anticipated   vehicle preview a potential major tipping point toward electric   vehicles -- and Tesla would be at the center of this critical   shift.Facebook:Facebook stockhas run into some road bumps recently. The stock has slid about   11% since the company reported its third-quarter results on Nov.   2. The quarter's results weregreat, but investors were spooked by management's references to   expectations for big investments in 2017. Investors, however,   haveseen this before. In 2014, Facebook similarly warned investors of plans for big   investments -- and the stock has since soared 56%.Obviously, big spending doesn't automatically mean Facebook's   stock will rise again. But the world's largest social network has   earned my trust with its long-term plans as it charged forward   with big investments in mobile, predicted Instagram's huge   potential when it purchased it for $1 billion, and improved its   native Facebook platform at a blistering speed that competition   can't match.And it's not like Facebook can't afford to get more aggressive   with its spending. The company generated $2.5 billion of free   cash flow in its most recent quarter alone -- up from $1.4   billion in the year-ago quarter.Apple:Apple's revenue and EPS have faced headwinds recently, down 9%   and 15%, respectively, in the tech giant's fiscal fourth quarter   compared to the year-ago period. So why would I hold onto a   business with financial results so dismal? Two reasons:The stock is cheap. With its price-to-earnings ratio of     just 14,Apple stockalready prices in expectations for sustained challenges.The scale and reach of Apple's robust ecosystem of     user-friendly products has proved to be a sustainable     foundation for customer loyalty, pricing power, and repeat     purchases.Sometimes, it's best just to sit back and give your stocks   time to perform. Image source: Getty Images.But beyond these reasons for holding these three stocks   throughout 2017, my main motive for holding them is simply to   avoid the pitfalls of market timing and to maximize my time   invested in stocks. The best way I know to invest is to simply   buy solid companies with long-term prospects and hold them for   the long haul.Sure, if Tesla, Facebook, or Apple begin to consistently make   poor decisions, I may consider selling. But barring any major   unexpected issues, I plan to give them the chance to meet -- or   possibly even exceed -- my expectations in 2017 and beyond.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

1 Big Solar Trend to Watch in 2017;1/1/2017;"Efficiency is now the name of the game in the solar industry   and leading manufacturers will spend the next few years moving   beyond commodity silicon solar panels to higher-efficiency   technology.SunPower Corporation(NASDAQ: SPWR) has long led the industry in efficiency and with   its X-Series product exceeding 23% efficiency that leadership   position won't end soon. But others are starting to catch up.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) recently announced a new record of 22.61% for its   mono-PERC cell technology, something others will follow.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) is another major manufacturer moving forward with   mono-PERC technology, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is launching high-efficiency panels this year with   Panasonic's HIT technology. The world of solar energy is about to   get a lot more efficient.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Chinese solar manufacturers put an emphasis on     efficiencySolar panel manufacturers, particularly in China, have been   plagued by little differentiation in their products. They use   similar equipment and processes to make solar panels, which leads   to very similar panel efficiencies and fairly similar cost   structures. But in the last decade there has been little   incentive to focus on efficiency because costs were coming down   quickly and often offset the advantage higher efficiency   brought.But the cost/efficiency dynamic is changing. Solar panel and   overall system costs have come down so far that even a   100-basis-point improvement in panel efficiency can lower a   system's cost per watt by 5% or more. And if that efficiency is   combined with lower long-term degradation, as it is with   SunPower's panels, the impact on cost per kWh can be even higher.   So, manufacturers finally have an incentive to increase   efficiency and lower costs.Trina Solar and Canadian Solar are investing in PERC   technology to move up the value curve. Higher-efficiency panels   will sell for a higher price per watt, particularly to customers   installing small residential or commercial projects where   efficiency is more valuable, and both companies want to capture   the financial benefit of the market. For example, a 300-watt   solar panel that sells for $0.40 per watt will generate $120 in   revenue. A 360-watt panel that sells for $0.55 per watt is worth   $198.Now that higher-efficiency panels are in demand, look for the   15% to 17% efficient panels that have dominated production to   begin to be replaced by panels that are 18% to 20% efficient.Tesla's efficiency playThe efficiency dynamic isn't lost on Tesla's SolarCity, which   is building a plant in Buffalo, New York, to make high-efficiency   solar panels. Management has said they expect efficiency to be   over 20% when the product launches with 22% panel efficiency on   the horizon.Since Tesla is installing mostly small rooftop systems, the   investment in efficiency makes sense. It leverages the company's   sales and installation costs and puts more watts of solar   production on each roof.SunPower's two-pronged efficiency planComing from a leadership position is SunPower, which has long   been an efficiency leader. The company's E-Series product, which   was 19% to 21% efficient, is now facing competition from PERC   manufacturers that have a lower cost structure. That's why the   investment in X-Series, which is over 23% efficient, has been   important to the last year's financial results in the residential   market. If X-Series can continue to improve efficiency and keep   down cost, the company could maintain a lead over mono-PERC   competitors.In the utility maker, SunPower is taking a different approach.   P-Series is its low-cost solar panel that's only slightly more   efficient than conventional solar panels. Right now, it's a   multicrystalline product but management has told me it will   eventually be a mono-crystalline product, likely leading to   efficiencies approaching 20%. And since there are fewer   processing steps, it should be lower cost than mono-PERC on a   per-watt basis.Jockeying for position in solar efficiencyEvery major manufacturer is trying to improve its efficiency   to differentiate itself and 2017 will likely be a transitional   year. A great deal of how the industry progresses in the year   ahead will depend on if Tesla can make its products as   planned, and how SunPower's strategy is played out. Which company   makes the right strategic moves in improving efficiency will see   a lot of upside in coming years.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Tech Investing Quotes From the World's Best Venture Capitalists;12/31/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.When you make a living by finding and investing in the world's   most promising start-ups, you probably know a thing or two about   business. Leading venture capital firms have minted fortunes for   themselves and their limited partners by investing in current   tech titans likeApple,Alphabet,Oracle,Facebook, and many more when they were just nascent start-ups.makeArticleAd();However, after considering the business wisdom ofvisionary business leaders, it recently occurred to me that examining some quotes from   leading VCs could also prove tremendously useful for tech   investors. So, banking off of this same logic, let's examine a   series of quotes from some of the world's leading venture   capitalists on subjects including the business of venture   capital, business in general, and technology.About the business of venture capitalMany readers may not be particularly familiar with the venture   capital world: how it works, how it's financed, and how VC firms   make money. As such, this quote from Union Squares Ventures   partner Fred Wilson serves as a nice way to frame what   exactly venture capitalists do.Venture capital is about capturing the value between the     start-up phase and the public company phase. -- Fred WilsonIn general, venture capital firms can invest in private   companies at any stage in their development. Though not always as   strictly codified, these stages range from the initial seed round   of financing used to get a nascent company off the ground to the   later stages, series C or later, that often take place in theyears preceding an IPO. What's more, the results can be astounding. According to the   National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the average annual   return of VC investments is an astounding 57%.Especially in moments when tech investing is particularly en   vogue, the number of VC firms and the amount of money chasing   start-ups can create some unintended consequences, as a number of   established venture capitalists have also noted.There are lots of ways to make money in venture capital, and     there are even more ways to be mediocre. The industry has too     much money and too many smart people chasing too few great     entrepreneurs. -- Dan LevitanAll markets have boom and bust cycles, and I think venture     capital market has even more exaggerated boom and bust cycles.     -- Fred WilsonBoth issues might sound eerily similar to the issues many   investors encounter when investing in the stock market. However,   much like our ethos here at The Motley Fool, investors can   overcome, or even benefit from the cyclical nature of the market   by maintaining a focus on the long term.The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm     over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a 13-year lockup     on our money. And so enterprise can go in and out of fashion     four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these     companies, and it's OK, because we can stay the course. -- Marc     AndreessenBusiness in generalInvesting in high-growth private companies involves many of   the same skill sets public market investors need to cultivate in   order to succeed. The best venture capitalists think about   business models, market economics, and competitive dynamics at a   high level. Especially in the tech sector, where newly minted   public companies often remain unprofitable, it's important for   investors to remember that a path toward eventual profitability   is an essential piece of any investing thesis, as Bill   Gurley succinctly states in the two following quote:If one asserts that buying customers below what they charge     them is a corporate strategy, this is in essence an arbitrage     game, and arbitrage games rarely last. -- Bill GurleyYou can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85     cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge     them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all     the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company     I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't     work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't     charging enough for the service level. -- Bill GurleyA litany of examples come to mind, here. Companies likeZynga,Gluu Mobile,Skull Candy, and evenTwitterhave generated tremendous losses for their investors as the   overly optimistic stories around which they came public   predictably failed to materialize. If the company's economics   don't make sense or don't seem achievable, that should be a major   red flag, but it's one investors have consistently overlooked --   to their detriment.Also similar to investing in public companies, the leaders of   the best start-ups resemble the entrepreneurs running the world's   most successful public companies. Individuals likeTesla's Elon Musk orFacebook's Mark Zuckerberg have taken huge personal risks to bring their   visions into the world. Further affirming this idea, leading   venture capitalists also seek this visionary quality in the   companies in which they invest.The very best entrepreneurs are relatively advantaged in     times of scarce capital. They can raise money in any     environment. Loose capital allows the less qualified to     participate in each market. -- Bill GurleyInnovation and technologyRounding out these quotes, venture capitalists live and die by   identifying the companies that will define coming waves of   disruption. As such, they spend a disproportionate amount of time   thinking about the current and future state of technology. One of   the key themes is that software will continue to automate and   upend sections of the economy as Marc Andreessen candidly   observes:Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be     disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley     companies doing the disruption in more cases than not. -- Marc     AndreessenHowever, software isn't necessarily the only way we should   understand technology either, as early Facebook investor Peter   Thiel notes:The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.     The rapid progress of information technology in recent decades     has made Silicon Valley the capital of ""technology"" in general.     But there is no reason why technology should be limited to     computers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing     things is technology. -- Peter Thiel fromZero to OneFurthering this idea, famed VC John Doerr sees a truly   game-changing investing opportunity in one largely undisrupted   area of the economy:Green-tech could be the largest economic opportunity of the     21st Century. -- John DoerrSpotting the next big thing is indeed hard work. However, as   the world's most successful venture capitalists have demonstrated   time and again, doing so is indeed possible. Similarly, investors   in public market companies that follow this same line of   reasoning can also do extremely well over the long term.   Integrating these above ideas to your research process should   certainly help increase your odds of successful investing.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

The Big Strategic Shift Coming to the Solar Industry in 2017;12/31/2016;"The solar industry has been through a lot of strategic changes   over the past decade as cell manufacturers moved to making   panels, panel manufacturers started building power plants, and   power plant companies began moving into financing. In many ways,   vertical integration was the name of the game.But the past year of turmoil has shown that vertically   integrating into every part of the solar business might not make   sense. There's no fundamental advantage an installer likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has in financing solar versus a bank, and in many   ways it may have a disadvantage. And solar manufacturers may not   be the best at building massive power plants, something utilities   and independent power producers have decades of experience doing.   So, what's the trend to watch in 2017? Solar companies are   offering an integrated product design that customers can install   more efficiently than the piecemeal designs of the past.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Backing away from the finance gameOne of the broad trends over the past five years in the solar   industry is that solar companies began to finance more of their   own projects. Small-system installers like Tesla's Solar,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) could offer simple lease or power purchase agreement   (PPA) financing with $0 for customers and then aggregate the tax   benefits and payments in large financing projects. For bigger   projects like whatFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) were building, self-financing eliminated a   discount buyers demanded for taking on project risk and allowed   them to take advantage of falling financing costs.If there was one broad finance trend in 2016, it was that   solar companies financing their own projects began to backfire.   Small projects began to be financed through loans as more banks   and small lenders emerged, lowering the cost of capital for   customers. And rising yields on yieldcos like8point3 EnergyPartners(NASDAQ: CAFD) made self-financing less attractive because the   price a yieldco would pay for a project began to decline. For   large developers, holding projects on the balance sheet suddenly   became a bad thing and now they're looking to sell projects   before construction even begins, leaving financing risk to a   company better suited to accept that risk.Designing entire systems will be the name of the gameIn response to these financing trends, major solar companies   are beginning to design off-the-shelf solutions for solar   developers and utilities. The developer will then take care of   things like financing and securing power purchase agreements,   while the solar company concentrates on designing solar systems   to maximize energy production and lower cost. In some cases,   they're even adding services beyond solar, like energy   storage.Image source: SunPower.This shift can be seen in First Solar and SunPower's product   line changes. First Solar is upgrading from Series 4 solar panels   to Series 6, which is a full panel and racking system with the   option of adding energy storage and functions all the way to   transmission. SunPower's Oasis system is a complete solution from   site selection to building a power plant with trackers and the   P-Series solar panels. Both solutions are essentially   off-the-shelf offerings the companies will provide to a variety   of customers around the world. And it means in many places   they'll be backing away from bidding on projects themselves in   many locations.SunPower's residential and commercial solar solutions follow   along the same lines. Known as Equinox and Helix, respectively,   they are a solution installers can buy pre-designed and just   install on a rooftop.Tesla has been moving to this model for years. It bought Zep   Solar to bring a racking product in-house, bought Silevo to begin   manufacturing solar panels, and now Tesla's acquisition of   SolarCity brings both products together with energy storage. Now,   Tesla will be making most of the valuable components of the solar   system. And it's moving toward more sales through loans, backing   away from leases and PPAs.Solar solutions are the next big thingMoving toward more complete solutions makes sense for the   solar industry because it helps move more cost from the field to   the factory, where components can be built efficiently and   designed to work seamlessly together. The days of piecemeal   design of solar systems are coming to an end.The companies that can combine solar solution design with   differentiated products like high-efficiency solar panels will be   well positioned for the future. Bottom line: SunPower, First   Solar, and Tesla have a leg up on the competition in building out   the solar product solutions of the future.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

"Tesla's New Autopilot Is ""Days"" From Release";12/30/2016;"When electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) announced its Autopilot 2.0 sensors in October,   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he hoped to begin rolling out major   software updates for the new technology before the year ended.   But with only one more day left in the year, it's not looking   like Tesla will meet its target. However, the software is ""almost   there,"" Musk said in a tweet on Thursday.""Under going final validation. Might go out in the next few   days,"" Musk tweeted back to someone asking about whether 8.1   would be released this weekend.makeArticleAd();Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its new Autopilot   sensors. Image source: Tesla Motors.Catching upThe update, which would be a part of the expected Tesla 8.1   software, is particularly important because it is set to help   catch up the capabilities of Autopilot 2.0 vehicles to those of   Autopilot 1.0. Until Tesla updates the software for vehicles with   its second-generation sensor suite, Tesla vehicles are lacking   key safety assist features, such as automatic emergency braking,   collision warning, blind-spot detection, and side-collision   warning. In addition, the Autopilot 2.0 vehicles are still   missing convenience features like auto-steer, auto-park, and   summoning.Earlier this month, Musk said on Twitter that the next update   may include most of the functionality from Autopilot 1.0.   Eventually, of course, Tesla plans for Autopilot 2.0 to exceed   Autopilot 1.0's capabilities, hence its new name: enhanced   autopilot.Why it mattersSince Autopilot 2.0 sensors are included standard in   every vehicle Tesla delivers, the stakes are high for Tesla to   get the software right.Just how useful Tesla's autopilot sensors are was recently   brought to light when a dash cam captured a Tesla vehicle   alerting an owner and begin applying brakes to avoid an accident   after the sensors observed a car hitting its brakes two vehicles   ahead.Original video, authorisation from the owner. Essential, no   one could predict the accident but the radar did and acted by   emergency braking.pic.twitter.com/70MySRiHGR- Hans Noordsij (@HansNoordsij)December 27, 2016This capability for Tesla vehicles to see ""through"" the car in   front of it was added in an important update in September. As   part of the update, Tesla upgraded radar from simply serving as a   supplementary sensor to become a primary control sensor alongside   the camera's image recognition system. Tesla asserted in a blog   post about the update that this would help vehicles ""almost   always hit the brakes correctly.""Going further, Tesla explained how the vehicle can   surprisingly see ""through"" vehicles:[A] Tesla will also be able to bounce the radar signal     under a vehicle in front -- using the radar pulse signature and     photon time of flight to distinguish the signal -- and still     brake even when trailing a car that is opaque to both vision     and radar. The car in front might hit the UFO in dense fog, but     the Tesla will not.Without Tesla's 8.1 software update, Tesla owners won't   benefit from safety features like this.Tesla's upcoming Autopilot update will be just the beginning   of many for Tesla vehicles with second-generation sensors. Longer   term, Tesla says Autopilot 2.0 will even enable fully autonomous   driving. But there are a few caveats: Tesla still needs to   validate the self-driving software, regulators will need to   approve the features' use, and owners will have to pay up $8,000   to $10,000, depending on whether they purchase the feature before   or after delivery (safety aspects of Autopilot, like emergency   braking, come standard on every Tesla).10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;12/30/2016;"As the year comes to a close, it's fitting that the week in   solar was dominated by the kind of large, macro trends that seem   to move and shake the solar industry every few months. But unlike   2015, when we had Nevada upend net metering in the final hours of   the year, most of the news from the solar industry is positive at   the end of 2016. There are still some challenges looking forward,   but policy seems to be favoring solar energy in the long   term.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();China resets renewable energy pricesOne of the biggest drivers of solar growth in 2016 was China's   feed-in tariff rates. A feed-in tariff drove an estimated 13 GW   of solar installations in the first half of the year before being   reset in the second half. Now feed-in tariff rates will fall   another 19% for 2017, and China has lowered its 2020 installation   target from 150 GW to a minimum of 105 GW.Chinese leadership has also suggested that local governments   use auctions for renewable energy, which has been a successful   arrangement in Latin America and Europe. At the very least, this   gives some stability to the solar market in 2017, and may help   increase demand for solar panels overall next year.Another state solar winOhio has had a freeze on its renewable energy mandates for the   last two years, and lawmakers wanted to extend that hold -- but   Governor John Kasich vetoed a bill that would have made energy   mandates voluntary for another two years. Kasich was praised by   seven major employers in Ohio for keeping renewable energy   mandates. And it shouldn't go unnoticed thatFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) has a major manufacturing plant there and is   upgrading the facility over the next couple of years.In state after state, solar energy has fought off regulatory   and legislative battles to grow its presence in the energy   industry. Ohio is another example of a big solar win, and as a   leading Midwestern state it may become a solar leader, showing   where the future of energy jobs is headed.Panasonic helping Tesla with solarPanasonic is coming to the rescue of SolarCity's Silevo solar   manufacturing plant, agreeing to invest $256 million in the   facility.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made the investment contingent on its SolarCity   acquisition going through; now that the companies are combined,   Panasonic is being brought in to help with solar.Panasonic says production will begin in the summer of 2017   with 1 GW of production expected in 2019, but it's worth pointing   out that Panasonic has had trouble making competitive solar   panels itself, and Silevo's technology has proven disappointing,   especially given the fact that it had to bring in a partner to   bring production to fruition.It's also worth noting that this Panasonic partnership will   help make the cells for the solar roof. Not only is the Buffalo   facility key to keeping Tesla ahead of competitors in rooftop   solar, it will be key to making the solar roof a reality. There's   a lot riding on this partnership today.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Shines in Consumer Reports Survey;12/30/2016;"Earlier this month,Consumer Reportsonce again named electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) the most-loved car brand, with the brand's 91%   overall owner-satisfaction rating trouncing every other car maker   on the planet. Indeed, second-place Porsche was a wide seven   percentage points behind. And third-place Audi trailed Tesla by a   whopping 14 percentage points. Topping off Tesla's high brand   score,CRalso said both of Tesla's vehicle models -- S and X -- had   exceptionally high customer satisfaction scores on their own.Here's a closer look.makeArticleAd();Tesla's Model S (left) and Model X (right). Image source: The   Motley Fool.Tesla's customer satisfactionSo, how exactly areCR's ratings derived?CRexplains:Our brand rankings represent owner sentiment across each     brand's product line. (Model satisfaction is determined by the     percentage of owners who responded ""definitely yes"" to the     question of whether they would buy the same vehicle if they had     it to do all over again.) To determine brand love -- or disdain     -- we took a straight average of the satisfaction score for     each brand's models.In order to qualify, the brand had to have at least two     models with data. For this analysis, we focused on cars from     model years 2014-2017 to represent the current state of the     brands, which included over 300,000 vehicles from the     survey.Of course, investors should note that whileCR's 91% customer satisfaction rating for Tesla was higher than any   other automaker's rating, the rating was down considerably from   its 98% and 99% ratings in recent years. This is likely   attributable to the Model S's wider adoption outside of the   hardcore early adopters who likely represented a large portion of   Tesla customers in the sedan's earlier years. Tesla's sales have   doubled over the last two years, opening up its vehicles to a   wider, more diverse customer base.Customers love the Model X, tooConsidering that Tesla's new Model X -- whichCRrecently criticized for having ""compromised functionality"" and   ""dismal first-year reliability"" -- was included in the survey   this year for the first time during 2016, it's arguably good news   to see Tesla still ranked so high on the list.The Model X. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla's Model X surprisingly performed quite well when it   comes to owner satisfaction. InCR's car-by-car owner satisfaction ratings, the Model X came in   eighth place, with a score of 88% -- not far behind the Model S's   94% rating. So, while the Model X was holding back Tesla's   overall brand ranking, the new SUV's score was still notably high   considering the reliability issues the complex vehicle has   experienced during its first year.Tesla said in its third-quarter shareholder letter, released   in October, that the Model X's reliability improved dramatically   as the year went on.""The amount of [reliability] issues that we have addressed   with Model X have fallen by 92% in the last 12 months,"" Tesla   said, ""a reflection of the improvements we have made in Model X   due to our ability and commitment to react quickly to   issues.""Image source: The Motley Fool.Improvements in reliability are not only important for   customers, but also for Tesla's business. By improving the   reliability of both the Model S and Model X, Tesla's warranty   accrual rates (the percentage of warranty reserves used for   warranty claims, on both new and used vehicles) declined between   Q2 and Q3.Tesla's ability to satisfy customers is a key metric for   investors. It's crucial for a young automaker to stand out with   satisfying products. If Tesla's ability to delight customers   fades, its well-capitalized competition could establish a   foothold with would-be Tesla customers and mitigate Tesla's   growth potential -- a threat that will only become more prominent   as automakers follow through with their plans to release more   long-range, fully electric vehicles in the coming years. Further,   Tesla's vehicles will likely be scrutinized closely in 2017, as   the company prepares to launch its lower-priced, higher-volume   Model 3 in the second half of the year.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

General Motors' main joint venture in China, Shanghai GM, is being charged with a fine of 201 million yuan or $29 million for monopolistic pricing behavior. Shanghai GM - a 50-50 joint venture between General Motors and state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp. - enforced minimum dealer sales price for Cadillac SRX, Chevrolet Trax and Buick Excelle models in order to counter competition. However, Chinese regulators are particular about the pricing of products and services in the economy and believe that this monopolistic behavior suppresses healthy market competition. Thus, they charged a penalty equivalent to 4% of Shanghai GM's annual sales (read more:General Motors Fined in China on Anti-Competitive Grounds).General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Tesla has signed an agreement with Panasonic Corp to produce photovoltaic cells and modules in Buffalo, NY, from the summer of 2017. The companies signed a non-binding letter of intent for the same in October. Per the agreement, Panasonic will bear the capital expenses needed for the plant in return for a long term purchase commitment by Tesla. The companies plan to increase the production volume of photovoltaic modules at the plant to 1 Gigawatt by 2019. Additionally, they will collaborate to develop the next generation of photovoltaic technology at the Fremont, CA plant of Tesla's subsidiary SolarCity.Tesla will use the cells and modules produced in the Buffalo plant to make solar panels for its non-solar roof products. The company will also use these cells in various kinds of solar glass tile roofs, when their production starts (read more:Tesla-Panasonic to Manufacture Solar Cells at Buffalo Plant).Currently, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3.3. Ford recently launched the next-generation Fusion Hybrid autonomous development vehicle.

GM Takes a Step Forward Toward Autonomous Vehicles;12/29/2016;"General Motors' (GM) CEO Mary Barra said that the company would start testing autonomous cars on the roads of Michigan very soon to evaluate how the driverless technology would perform against the greater Detroit area's harsh winters.This comes after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed the bill permitting the testing of autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads.General Motors plans to test the self-driving Chevy Bolt electric vehicles on the public roadways of Michigan after Snyder agreed to allow the testing of certain parameters for testing and deploying driverless cars in the state. Michigan aims to move ahead of California and other states in a drive to become home to the autonomous car movement. Silicon Valley players includingTesla(TSLA),Alphabet(GOOG)(GOOGL) and Uber are at the forefront of implementing self-driving technology. The laws provide ride-sharing services to use autonomous cars without human intervention.makeArticleAd();Barra made another major announcement that the next generation self-driving cars would be produced in the Orion Township assembly plant, where the company manufactures the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. The testing vehicles will be equipped with LIDAR, sensors, cameras and other devices for safety. Barra said in a press conference, ""We expect GM will become the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass production assembly plant.""The Detroit automaker has already been testing its driverless vehicle in its Technical Center campus in Warren, Michigan. In total, General Motors has around 40 testing vehicles in the two cities. The automaker now plans to extend its testing to the public roads in the metro area of Detroit. General Motors proposes to make the area its key location for advancing its autonomous technology for winters.The bill signed by Snyder lays out parameters for testing the technology by establishing regulations on how driverless vehicles could legally run on public roads. The enacted law permits testing of vehicles without human intervention and without steering wheels or pedals.However, there are certain challenges that driverless cars would have to face. During winters, snowfall can cause the roads to be unclear and such tough road conditions would make the movement of cars not driven by humans unpredictable.Push toward going autonomousGeneral Motors' moves in the last 18 months have clearly displayed its aggression in developing the autonomous technology. The carmaker's announcement regarding its partnership with startup firm Lyft and acquisition of Cruise Automation are among its latest initiatives in advancing its autonomous technology.The automaker has been fueling its effort to develop a strong robust autonomous technology. This can be validated through the company's latest partnership and acquisition moves. In addition, General Motors has also been testing prototypes in Arizona and California. At the press conference, Barra displayed the electric Chevrolet Bolt with rooftop sensors, which is designed to assist autonomous driving.General Motors has been working hard to build a foolproof driverless technology. The company's management hasn't disclosed when General Motors will begin testing without a human driver but expects it to happen over the next two years. General Motors also plans to begin operating a fleet of self-driving taxis, which would be allowed under the Michigan law.Disclosure:I do not hold any position in the stock mentioned in this article.Start afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Warren Buffett Recent BuysFree seven-day trialWhat Should Be Your First Stock?Toshiba Announces Possible Write-Down of Several Billion DollarsPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Today's three big stock   charts look atTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Visa Inc(NYSE:V) andWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), as all three stocks are getting ready to make technically   driven moves when the New Year opens for trading.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)makeArticleAd();Shares of Tesla are seeing selling today, despite some   positive news in the media over the last few days. The TSLA   selloff is more attached to the technically oversold signal   generated by the recent rally than anything else. That said, the   response to this signal is paramount in setting the tone for   Tesla's first-quarter trading direction.While the recent rally has taken out a few technical   trendlines, it has left TSLA open to a reversal as the 200-day   moving average is acting out as resistance. This trendline acted   as resistance for the shares in November, ultimately sending them   tumbling back to the $180-support-level.The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017In addition, the chart resistance of $220 has continued to   build. Tesla traders are familiar with this price point providing   reversals as the stock spent an extended period consolidating   above $220 in the summer months. A break back below $220 and the   200-day will likely trigger technical selling that moves TSLA   shares 10% lower in the first month of the New Year. Upside   potential remains if Tesla gets enough buying here to   maintain levels above this critical trading zone.Visa Inc (V)Visa shares have been worked into a technical corner as they   continue to try to muster the strength to move back above the   $80-level. The growing problem is that this mark is becoming   congested with technical trendlines that are declining to provide   resistance for V. The pending Death Cross that will be formed in   the next two weeks based on current trends is also concerning for   Visa stock.Since rolling over in October, V stock has been   underperforming the market by a wide margin. The bump in consumer   optimism seen after the elections didn't even help the credit   card processor to gain traction. Now, Visa stock is facing   growing pressure and a likely dip into the lower $70s during the   first quarter of 2017.Staunch pressure from the $80-level on the chart is now even   stronger from the 50-day moving average, which has descended to   this same price region. The declining 50-day on its own puts V   stock in an intermediate-term bearish category.By our model's estimates, we will see a Death Cross on Visa   stock in the next two weeks when the 50-day moving average   crosses below the 200-day. This is more of a headline-grabber   than a reliable signal, but it will drive home short-term   selling.For now, traders are better off watching for the next   meaningful dip to buy shares of V, or moving on to another   processor in the same sector.Walt Disney Co (DIS)Disney shares have been one of the better performers in the   Consumer Discretionary sector as they have shot 15% higher since   November. Now, DIS stock is pulling back from overbought signals,   but the move appears to be nothing more than a rest ahead of the   next rally.Looking at the trendline analysis, Disney has successfully   transitioned into intermediate-term bullish conditions as of Dec.   7, and has improved the breadth of the move.Should You Buy Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)       Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe current pullback is a ""healthy"" correction as DIS shares   moved too far, too fast. This means that the profit-takers are   sending shares lower right now, and it's not a change in the   money flow into the Disney stock. Given that DIS shares boast a   1.5% dividend, they aren't going to get tangled-up in the   interest rate risk trade as the Ten Year Treasury Yield continues   to push higher. Instead, Disney provides average dividend yield   potential along with growth - a good combination for the current   market.Watch for DIS shares to test the $100 to $102-range on prices   if the selling pressure picks up, but this is where we're more   likely to see technical traders start to pick up on the   opportunity for the shares to set forth on their next rally.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       2017The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Tesla Motors Inc   (TSLA), Visa Inc (V) and Walt Disney Co (DIS)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

General Motors' main joint venture in China, Shanghai GM, is being charged with a fine of 201 million yuan or $29 million for monopolistic pricing behavior. Shanghai GM - a 50-50 joint venture between General Motors and state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp. - enforced minimum dealer sales price for Cadillac SRX, Chevrolet Trax and Buick Excelle models in order to counter competition. However, Chinese regulators are particular about the pricing of products and services in the economy and believe that this monopolistic behavior suppresses healthy market competition. Thus, they charged a penalty equivalent to 4% of Shanghai GM's annual sales (read more:General Motors Fined in China on Anti-Competitive Grounds).General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Tesla has signed an agreement with Panasonic Corp to produce photovoltaic cells and modules in Buffalo, NY, from the summer of 2017.

Per the agreement, Panasonic will bear the capital expenses needed for the plant in return for a long term purchase commitment by Tesla. The companies plan to increase the production volume of photovoltaic modules at the plant to 1 Gigawatt by 2019. Additionally, they will collaborate to develop the next generation of photovoltaic technology at the Fremont, CA plant of Tesla's subsidiary SolarCity.Tesla will use the cells and modules produced in the Buffalo plant to make solar panels for its non-solar roof products.

Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock for More Free Profits;12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the surface,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) looks like a short seller's dream stock. But for decades, the bears have been wrong about AMZN stock.Source:Atomic Taco Via FlickrMy last write-up on Amazon was a complete an easy win that delivered a 22% yield in about a month. Today, I'd like to set up another trade on AMZN.makeArticleAd();Buying equities at all-time highs carries undue risk. This is especially true for a momentum play like AMZN stock. Should the markets correct, Amazon and other momentum stocks will lead lower faster than most other stocks. Therein lies the dilemma. How can I go long Amazon without taking undue risk?Luckily, the options markets allow me to structure trades with limited and calculated risk. In this case, I will buy a bullish play since I have house money from previous AMZN trades. I also will sell bullish risk at levels that I deem unlikely to be reached.Fundamentally, Amazon is great. It's eating the lunch of all its competitors. The e-commerce giant has crippled brick-and-mortar retail. And it's also beating a lot of other tech companies in the cloud with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division.7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%     Upside in 2017Also, theAmazon Echo and Tapsold out during the holidays. The ubiquity of these two could infuse an influx of new Prime members. This membership money flows to the bottom line, so there could be an upside surprise.Click to EnlargeTechnically, I see AMZN's stock price tightening. This usually resolves itself with a breakout from these levels. The direction of the breakout though unclear, I am willing to bet it will be to the upside. So I will buy that upside potential and finance it by selling risk below current levels.I see similar bullish setups in other mega-caps likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). I could diffuse the risk and buy calls in thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ). But instead I will continue betting on a clear winner in AMZN - as long as markets in general don't correct early in 2017.Let's take a look at the trade.How to Trade Amazon Stock HereThe bet:Buy the AMZN Mar $785/$790 debit call spread for $2.10 per contract. That would be my maximum risk. If Amazon rises above $790, I stand to double my money.If you want to make this a true lotto ticket, buy the call spread much higher than current levels. The Feb AMZN $820/$825 debit call spread only costs $1.30 per contract. It's higher, so it's less likely to win … but the reward would be much greater.Red-Hot Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending 2016     on a CliffhangerI always like to limit my risk. In this case, I want to sell bullish risk to finance the purchase of the call spread.The Bank:Sell AMZN Feb $675/$670 credit put spreads for 65 cents per contract. Ideally, I need AMZN stock to stay above $675 per share through mid-February.I am not obliged to hold these AMZN trades through expiration.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX);12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed heading into the open, as Wall   Street faces another round of data before heading into the New   Year's break. Weekly jobless claims and November trade-balance   data are on tap, and could provide additional pressure to stocks   after yesterday's 100-point loss on the Dow, pushing the 20,000   dream back into 2017.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere last seen up 0.02%, withS&P 500futures up 0.09% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.04%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, volume recovered a bit on Wednesday, as   those traders remaining on Wall Street looked to hedge their   positions ahead of the New Year's break. That said, activity was   still anemic, with only about 10.3 million calls and 9.2 million   puts changing hands. Running against the grain, however, the   CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to   another two-week low of 0.61. But that wasn't enough to stop the   10-day moving average ticked higher once again to 0.65 - a   one-month high.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) was targeted by a synthetic short amid continued below-average   call volume. Elsewhere,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) reversed Tuesday's gains following a bearish tweet from Citron   Research, whileValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) attracted some rather unusual deep out-of-the-money call   selling activity.Apple Inc. (AAPL)With no major headlines and little in the way of potential   drivers, AAPL stock appears to have once again stalled in the   $117-$118 region. Apple shares hit a wall in this area back in   October, ultimately rolling over and heading toward a low near   $104 before finding a bottom.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017This time, options traders appear to be looking for a repeat   performance heading into 2017.Total volume on AAPL stock came in at a respectable 683,000   contracts, despite the lack overall activity in the options pits.   Call volume, meanwhile, only accounted for about 54% of the day's   take, arriving well below Apple's daily average. What's more, one   trader in particular took out a rather large synthetic short   position on AAPL stock.Specifically, a block of 9,500 Jan 2017 series $110 puts were   bought late yesterday at the ask price of 32 cents, according toTrade-Alert.com. At the same time, a block of 9,500 Jan 2017 series $110 calls   were sold at the bid of $7.15. The trader netted a credit of   $6.83, or $683 per pair of contracts, for the trade, and can   realize a profit as implieds decline and AAPL stock   stagnates.Additionally, the trade has near unlimited downside potential,   with the put gaining significantly in value if AAPL stock trades   below $110 ahead of expiration, and unlimited upside risk due to   the sold $110 call.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)After surging more than 9% on Tuesday following abullish research note from Pacific Crest, NVDA stock gave back most of those gains following anexceedingly bearish note from Citron Research. According to Citron, Wall Street is ignoring market headwinds   that will push NVDA stock back to $90, including increased market   competition and lower licensing revenue.Options activity on NVDA was little changed compared to   Tuesday's action, with calls accounting for 54% of the 662,000   contracts traded in the Wednesday session. Furthermore, the total   January 2017 put/call open interest ratio (which includes all   January weekly series) ticked higher to 1.63, suggesting profit   taking from call traders, and/or increased put activity.For Jan 2017 series, peak call OI totals 6,900 contracts at   the $100 strike, while peak put OI numbers 5,000 contracts at the   $90 strike, as neither call nor put traders expect NVDA to move   much higher.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX)VRX stock has had a rough 2016, with the shares plunging more   than 86% on the year. What's more, Valeant shares are a far cry   from their 2015 peak near $263, closing yesterday at a lowly   $14.23 by comparison. The plummeting share price hasn't deterred   many VRX options traders, however, with the stock seeing volume   of more than 241,000 contracts on Wednesday, where calls   accounted for a whopping 89% of the day's take.But there was some exceedingly odd block activity on VRX   yesterday.Trade-Alert.comdata indicates that a large block of 45,000 VRX Jan 2017 series   $27.50 calls were sold for a bid price of 2 cents, or $2 per   contract. At the same time, a block of nearly 30,000 January   $42.50 calls were sold for a bid of a penny, or $1 per   contract.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock: THIS Is the       Number to WatchThis deep-out-of-the-money call selling on VRX could be the   closure of a long-held bullish position, especially considering   January LEAPS have been available for quite some time.But the oddest element to this trade is that implied   volatility for these options is through the roof at 115% and   162%, respectively. In other words, options traders are pricing   in one heck of a move for VRX through January 2017 expiration.   This is fortunate for the aforementioned trader, as it provides   some return on exiting that long call play on VRX when these   contracts would normally be worthless at this point.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Sell in January 20177 Stocks That Won't Be Around a Year From       NowThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock: THIS Is the Number to Watch;12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEver since hitting lows around $180 in early December,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has rebounded 22% - far outpacing theS&P 500andNasdaq-100. However, just as the previous selloff in Tesla stock was   overdone - as I have mentioned before - so too is this rally.Now, I'm looking for TSLA shares to consolidate around the key   $220 level over the coming weeks.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');From a technical perspective, Tesla stock is showing   some extremely overbought readings, with the 9-day RSI at   nearly 85. Previous instances when Tesla stock reached such   levels proved to be very opportune times to take a short position   in TSLA stock.Click to EnlargeOne of the biggest drivers of Tesla's recent monster rally may   have been short covering. TSLA stock was thesecond-most shorted Nasdaq stockas of Dec. 15, with days to cover at 8.72. The average Nasdaq-100   stock had a days-to-cover measure of just 3.51. So it's likely   that much of the rally since Dec. 15 can be attributed to shorts   covering before year's end.But with the shorts obliterated, Tesla shares may no   longer enjoy this benefit.5 Stocks to Sell in January 2017In aprevious post on TSLA, I highlighted how $220 was the number to watch in Tesla.   Certainly that still applies. Tesla stock has once again returned   to that critical level. Given the magnitude of the recent move, I   think TSLA will encounter difficulties moving past this key area   - at least in the short-term.Click to EnlargeYesterday's price action was telling, with TSLA stock opening   past the $220 level and trading higher, only to succumb to   selling pressure and closing back below $220. This type of   reversal day - especially at a key inflection point and following   10 days of gains in the past 12 - often signals that the buyers   have become exhausted.Click to EnlargeTo position for a stall in Tesla's recent rally, I prefer a   short call spread.How to Trade Tesla Stock HereBuy the TSLA Jan $237.50 calls and sell the TSLA Jan     $235 calls for a 50-cent net credit.These are the traditional monthly options that expire Jan. 20,   2017, well before Tesla's earnings report, expected to come   Feb. 8.Maximum gain on the trade is $50 per spread. Maximum risk is   $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%.Red-Hot Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending 2016       on a CliffhangerThe short $235 strike is positioned 6.9% higher than the   $219.74 closing price of TSLA stock, providing a nice upside   cushion. This also aligns with Tesla's late July highs.I would close out the trade on a meaningful move past $235   while looking to have the spread expire worthless and keep the   initial $50 credit if TSLA stock remains well-behaved.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Motors, Inc. to Announce Vehicle Deliveries Next Week;12/28/2016;"GivenTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) practice of announcing quarterly vehicle   deliveries within three days of the end of the quarter, the   electric-car maker is due to update investors on the important   metric sometime between Sunday morning and Tuesday night. Ahead   of its important Model 3 launch next year, will the automaker   meet expectations and potentially strengthen investor confidence   in the company's ability to keep growing?Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Here's a look back at Tesla's recent vehicle deliveries, and a   look ahead at what to expect from deliveries during the important   holiday quarter.Rapid growthThe company's recent growth sets the stage for high   expectations in Tesla's fourth quarter.In its third quarter, Tesla reported surprising growth in   vehicle deliveries. Vehicles deliveries soared 114% year over   year and 72% sequentially thanks to a sequential rebound in Model   S deliveries and a continued production ramp-up of the company's   late-2015 launched Model X SUV.Data retrieved from quarterly SEC filings for quarters shown.   Chart source: author.Notably, Tesla's third-quarter deliveries helped drive the   company's highest year-over-year growth in the key metric in any   12-month period since the second half of 2014. In the   trailing-12-month period ending Sept. 30, Tesla's vehicle   deliveries were up 66% year over year.What to expect in Q4Going into its fourth quarter, management said it expects to   deliver ""just over 25,000"" vehicles. This would represent only   about a 1% sequential increase in deliveries, but it would make   for a 44% year-over-year jump.Tesla didn't make guessing its vehicle deliveries very easy in   2016. The company missed its quarterly guidance for deliveries   during the first two quarters of the year, and it subsequently   reduced its full-year guidance from expectations for 80,000 to   90,000 vehicles to a forecast for about 79,000 units.And another factor making forecasting difficult is the way the   company's quarterly Model S deliveries have bounced around   recently, hitting an all-time high above 17,000 in the fourth   quarter of 2015 and falling below 10,000 in the second quarter of   2016. While Model S deliveries rebounded significantly in Q3 to   16,000 units, it's not clear whether there is more growth ahead   for the luxury sedan.But despite recent volatility in Model S deliveries, and   despite the company's missed targets in the first half of the   year, there's still good reason to believe Tesla could meet or   even exceed its fourth-quarter guidance. Namely, demand could   benefit fromTesla's introduction of self-driving hardware,   recent updates to the Model S and X, and increasing Model X   production.Model X in Tesla's factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.While there are simply too many moving pieces to know exactly   how many vehicles Tesla will deliver during its fourth quarter, I   believe the company's guidance is reasonable.Investors will probably be watching Tesla's fourth-quarter   deliveries particularly close, since the figure comes as the   company is gearing up for its importantModel 3 launchlate next year. Thanks to plans for high-volume production and   deliveries of the Model 3, Tesla hopes to boost its current   annualized production run rate of 100,000 units to 500,000 units   in 2018. Investors, therefore, will want to ensure that Tesla can   hit its smaller targets today, to give more weight to the   company's more ambitious Model 3 production and delivery targets.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Below we take a look at what to expect from BlackBerry's software-focused businesses going into next year.Trefis has an$8 price estimate for BlackBerry, which is roughly 15% ahead of the current market price.See our complete analysis for BlackBerry     heremakeArticleAd();Enterprise Mobility Management And SecurityBlackBerry's software and services revenues stood at $486 million for the first nine months of FY'17 (fiscal years end in February), marking a 29% increase on a year-over-year basis. Enterprise mobility management remained the key driver of sales, with ~9300 new enterprise subscriber additions over the first nine months of the fiscal year. The EMM market is expected to grow from$1.76 billion in 2016 to over $4.5 billion by 2020, driven by mounting electronic security concerns and an increasing shift from PCs to mobile devices, which are often employee-owned. BlackBerry could outgrow the market, given that it recently took steps to unify its various enterprise mobility and security offerings under the ""BlackBerry Secure"" umbrella, enabling it to provide end-to-end security solutions, while helping customers lower total cost of ownership (related: What BlackBerry Aims To Achieve With Its Latest Security Offering). Moreover, roughly ~80% of BlackBerry's software and services revenue, excluding patent licensing and professional services, are now recurring after the firm transitioned to a licensing model for its EMM software. This should result in revenue growth as recent subscriber adds are monetized.Emerging Businesses Can Gain Traction,   But Competition Likely To Be IntenseThe relative revenue stability in the enterprise software space is giving BlackBerry headroom to expand its other software-oriented businesses such as connected vehicles and Internet of Things. The company recently signed an agreement to work directly with Ford Motor Company to expand its use of BlackBerry QNX and security software. The deal, which effectively makes BlackBerry a Tier-1 supplier to the auto behemoth, could pave the way for  more deals with auto manufacturers going forward (related: Why BlackBerry's Software Deal With Ford Is Promising). BlackBerry is also betting big on the car of the future, launching an Innovation Center for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, with plans to hire over 600 engineers for this effort in the near term. While the final product may be a few years away, competition in the space is likely to be intense, with deep-pocketed Silicon Valley players such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Google (NASDQ:GOOG, GOOGL) investing heavily in their own respective platforms.BlackBerry's IoT business is also slowly coming to fruition. The company's Radar solution, which caters to the fleet management market, saw some business development activity this year, winning contracts with trucking firms including Caravan Transport Group in Canada and Titanium Transportation in the U.S. , while carrying out a few other pilot deployments. However, the fleet management market is very fragmented, with competition only likely to get more intense with wireless behemoth Verizon doubling down on the space with its $2.4 billion purchase of market leader Fleetmatics earlier this year. Larger players are likely to benefit from greater economies of scale and better network effects, posing a threat to BlackBerry.Looking For Greater Transparency In 2017While the growth in BlackBerry's Software business is unlikely to make up for the loss of revenue from the smartphone and SAF businesses, the greater mix of high gross margin software revenue should help BlackBerry improve its profitability. That said, there are some concerns relating to a lack of transparency for the software unit. Although software is likely to account for roughly two-thirds of BlackBerry's 2017 revenues, per our estimates, BlackBerry has not been breaking down its various software-related revenue streams, leaving some uncertainty from a forecasting standpoint. Moreover, we will be looking for the company to provide other metrics such as subscriber figures, average revenue per subscriber and churn rates, which are typical of firms providing SaaS products with recurring revenues.Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"

How Tesla Can Succeed in Solar in 2017;12/28/2016;"WhenTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarCity this fall, it marked a big   strategic shift for the company. Tesla is no longer just a   supplier of batteries to rooftop solar installers like SolarCity;   it is now a full-fledged solar company.SolarCity employs tens of thousands of people selling and   installing solar systems, and it is also building a manufacturing   plant and has a large financing arm that handles billions of   dollars in solar financing deals. This makes Tesla a complicated   player in solar energy, but there are three ways it can really   differentiate itself from its peers in 2017.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Manufacturing has to live up to expectationsTesla CEO Elon Musk and SolarCity have spent two years talking   about making solar cells and panels, and in 2017, the rubber has   to hit the road. When SolarCity bought Silevo in 2014 and began   construction on a 1 gigawatt (GW) solar panel manufacturing plant   in New York, the thought was that SolarCity could be a technology   leader as well as a sales and installation giant. It's been a   difficult process, to say the least.Silevo has yet to produce solar panels at scale, and when   Tesla bought SolarCity, one of the impacts was that Panasonic   would be brought in to help with solar manufacturing. None of the   companies has said a lot about what the details of Panasonic's   involvement will be, but the fact that a third party would have   to be brought in is concerning. And the time to make efficiency   advancements before competitors do is coming to a close.SolarCity thought it could make cells that were 22% efficient   with Silevo technology, which would lead to 19% to 20% efficient   modules. That would be an advance, but with mono-PERC technology   -- which will have high teens efficiency -- starting to be rolled   out by Chinese manufacturers, there's not a huge advantage to   this product SolarCity/Silevo hasn't even proven it can make. And   industry leaderSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is already producing cells that are 25.1%   efficient and modules over 23% efficiency, so the   Tesla/SolarCity/Silevo group is falling behind and has to catch   up fast.Then there's the solar roof, which is a great headline but   mostly a mystery right now. We don't know price, efficiency, or   anything about installation, so it's tough to say whether that   product will impact Tesla in 2017.What's clear is that Tesla has to get solar manufacturing   right this year. If it can, it will have a high-efficiency   product with traditional solar panels and potentially a   compelling new product with the solar roof.Ditch reliance on the leaseIn 2016, the residential solar industry came to the quick   realization that third-party financing from the lease/power   purchase agreement (PPA) won't be the dominant paradigm forever.   More loan financing is coming available and customers want the   choice that comes with self-selecting everything from panels to   financing.This takes away a key differentiator for SolarCity, which has   been able to leverage its size to lower financing costs for its   lease/PPA. Now, the company needs to make the transition to   loans, and fast. But there's opportunity here.Large installers are fairly slow in making big changes to   their business models and Tesla can be a leader in moving to the   loan. If it does, it could mean more upfront cash generation from   solar, which would fund solar manufacturing and even the Model 3   expansion. Loans could be a boon for Tesla in 2017 if it makes a   big transition and leaves its third-party financing model   behind.Image source: Tesla.Energy storage is Tesla's biggest differentiatorThe single biggest advantage Tesla has in solar is that it can   integrate design up and down the supply chain. Solar panels,   racking, inverters, and energy storage design are now all   in-house, and that could allow the company to lower costs and   offer new products to customers.In 2017, I would expect energy storage with the Powerwall 2 to   become a much larger part of the business. And with the ability   to integrate the inverter with storage, there are multiple ways   to create value for customers with energy storage. Look for the   company to leverage this fact this year.The SolarCity acquisition may have been a great moveNow that SolarCity is part of Tesla, the company has to make   the transition to a solar installer and manufacturer. In a highly   competitive industry, that may be easier said than done. But with   a high-efficiency manufacturing plant under way, scale that beats   all competitors, and an integrated energy storage product, Tesla   could be well positioned for the future. Now it just has to   execute to create value for shareholders and customers.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla-Panasonic to Manufacture Solar Cells at Buffalo Plant;12/28/2016;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAhas signed an agreement with Panasonic CorpPCRFYto produce photovoltaic cells and modules in Buffalo, NY, from the summer of 2017. The companies signed a non-binding letter of intent for the same in October.Per the agreement, Panasonic will bear the capital expenses needed for the plant in return for a long term purchase commitment by Tesla. The companies plan to increase the production volume of photovoltaic modules at the plant to 1 Gigawatt by 2019. Additionally, the companies will collaborate to develop the next generation of photovoltaic technology at the Fremont, CA plant of Tesla's subsidiary SolarCity.Tesla will use the cells and modules produced in the Buffalo plant to make solar panels for its non-solar roof products. The company will also use these cells in various kinds of solar glass tile roofs, when their production starts.Price MovementTesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for most of the year.

Tesla Leans on Panasonic to Build Solar Panels in Buffalo Plant;12/27/2016;"Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) is making good on its promise to bring in   Panasonic to help with solar manufacturing, now that Tesla's   acquisition of SolarCity is complete. The company announced   on Tuesday that Panasonic will invest $256 million in SolarCity's   Buffalo, New York, manufacturing facility, with a goal of   starting production in the summer of 2017.The hope is that the partnership will bring higher-efficiency   solar panels to SolarCity and Tesla, and a greater level of   integration. But the idea that Panasonic was needed in the first   place is a bit of a mystery.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why Panasonic is neededIn June 2014, SolarCity announced the acquisition of Silevo, a   solar technology start-up that hoped to make high-efficiency   solar panels in a plant in Buffalo, New York. To pay for the   plant, SolarCity got the state to throw in a $750 million subsidy   in exchange for commitments to meet minimum investments and hire   workers in the state. It seemed like SolarCity was on its way to   becoming a solar manufacturing giant, with a target of production   beginning in 2016.But in the summer of 2016, as part of the acquisition of   SolarCity, Tesla announced plans to bring in Panasonic to make   solar cells using technology similar to Silevo's. It seemed that   Silevo's technology wasn't working out as planned -- if it were,   Panasonic wouldn't be needed at the plant at all.It now appears that Panasonic will essentially take over cell   manufacturing using its own technology, which adds a thin   amorphous silicon layer to the cell to increase   efficiency. What's interesting about moving to this   technology is that Panasonic suspended operations at a solar-cell   plant in Osaka, Japan, because of weak demand. If the technology   was a true differentiator on efficiency at competitive costs, the   company could have looked outside Japan to markets like the U.S.,   where high efficiency is in high demand. But Panasonic's   technology wasn't differentiated enough to thrive on the open   market, so it's interesting that Tesla chose Panasonic as   the partner for Buffalo.Tesla has a bigger plan for solar cellsTesla hopes the Buffalo plant will help advance   higher-efficiency solar panels that pack more power generation   into each rooftop solar install, and will provide cells for   Tesla's solar roof. This will also further vertically integrate   the manufacturing business. Tesla now designs and makes solar   panels, roof racking, and an energy storage product with an   inverter. In theory, having development of these products   under one roof should make for a more seamless design and install   for Tesla.For Tesla to differentiate itself from competitors in solar,   this integration will be key. And the Buffalo facility could be   where Tesla's solar vision comes together.Tesla has a lot to prove in solarSaying you're going to make a high-efficiency solar panel or a   solar roof is one thing, but actually doing it is apparently   proving more difficult than Elon Musk and SolarCity had planned.   Panasonic wouldn't have been asked to invest $256 million in the   Buffalo solar facility if Silevo's technology were working as   expected. And we still don't have confirmation that solar panels   coming from the facility will be higher-efficiency than those   from competitors, or cost-competitive.Making solar panels is easier said than done. Tesla bringing   in Panasonic shows that Silevo/SolarCity/Tesla are finding that   out the hard way.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Year;12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been a decidedly tough year for athletic apparel makers, and despite making several strategic moves to set itself up for the future,Under Armour Inc(NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) was no exception.Source:SandyDover via Flickr (Modified)UAA stock is down nearly 30% on the year, and the firm's Class C shares have lost a whopping 40% in 2016.makeArticleAd();Looking at those figures, you might think you were dealing with a company that has very little hope for the future, but in fact Under Armour appears to have a relatively bright future, making it a good buy at its current valuation.What Happened to UA StockA few key events led to UA stock's declines over the past year, but the majority of them are unlikely to keep shares of Under Armour depressed for long.In early December, Under Armour's ticker symbol changed and that contributed to the decline in the stock price as investors shied away from the company due to confusion over which shares were which and questions regarding management's decision to have three separate share classes.10 Best Stocks for Retirement InvestorsBack in April, UA introduced a new C class of stock with the ticker symbol UA.C. These shares had all the same economic value as the A class shares, but shareholders would have no voting rights. CEO Kevin Plank also created a third class of B stock that does carry voting rights, but only he holds these shares. Essentially what the stock split did was allow UA to issue new stock without Plank giving up his majority stake in the company.If this wasn't confusing enough, Under Armour thenrenamedit's class C shares to just ""UA"" rather than ""UA.C,"" and the A shares (which used to be named ""UA"") became ""UAA"" at the beginning of December.While it was a contributing factor, confusion wasn't the entire reason that UA stock tumbled this year. Under Armour also faced some pretty worrying headwinds that caused investors to second guess whether the company could remain relevant in the years to come.Perhaps the most worrying event was the bankruptcy and closure of Sports Authority, which hit UA hard because the distributor was Under Armour's largest seller. Sports Authority's troubles hurt UA's bottom line and weighed on investor sentiment. Many pointed to the bankruptcy as a sign of things to come within the sector.Finally, despite a third-quarter earnings-beat, Under Armour's results were less than perfect. The firm's margins declined and third-quarter sales growth was at a six-year low. Fourth-quarter guidance suggested that the final quarter's sales growth would be even slower as well.Why You Should Buy UA StockWith three major events contributing to UA and UAA stock's decline in 2016, there's a lot of reason to believe that things are looking bright for the new year. Even without considering all the things that UA has done to set itself up for a profitable future, UA stock is poised to gain.UA's losses resulting from investor confusion over the stock split and new ticker symbols are unlikely to have a lasting impact. As the confusion begins to fade, UA stock will stabilize.This is especially true for the C class shares, which are a great buy as they are trading at a discount. The voting rights that make A shares more valuable are negligible for traders, as Plank has majority control no matter what, so C shares are a good buy for investors who see UA improving in the coming year.The Sports Authority closure was certainly a blow to UA's momentum, but it doesn't signal an athletic-wear apocalypse as many traders feared. It's worrying, but other similar retailers likeDicks Sporting Goods Inc(NYSE:DKS) are stillthriving, so it isn't time to panic about the industry's stability just yet.UA's sales issues are also a concern, but the company isn't in danger of falling apart, so a few difficult quarters shouldn't be reason to write UA stock off completely. Sales have improved by at least 20% every quarter for nearly a decade, and that is a pretty positive sign of stability.Better Days Ahead for UAOnce you've addressed the three biggest reasons UA stock is down in the dumps, the case for a marked increase in the next year looks promising. Not only are some of the market's worries about Under Armour overdone, but the firm has also made some strategic moves this year that have put it in a good position for 2017.One of the biggest moves the company made this year was stepping into the athleisure market. Athletic wear has made it's way into the closets of just about everyone whether or not they've ever set foot in the gym. Under Armour's product line has always been aimed at athletes with clothing that is designed for performance rather than style.However, the firmrecently unveileda new line of apparel that focuses on casual athletic wear for the masses. This is a segment that is likely to continue growing in the coming year, so it's promising to see UA throwing its hat in the athleisure ring. This push into casual-wear is likely to be supported by Under Armour's new partnership withKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS), another big factor to watch in the coming year.The Bottom LineUA stock is a buy for investors looking to add to their portfolio in the coming year. The stock's major decline in 2016 has been the result of the market's overreaction to some challenges that the company is facing.Should I Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3     Pros, 3 ConsNot only can investors expect much of that downside to fade in the coming year, but UA's latest foray into casual wear is likely to give the stock a further boost.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to Own10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for     2017The postThis Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Yearappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs should be no surprise,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) had another eventful year.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)The company dealt withproduction issueswith the Model X as demand surged. Then there was the mega acquisition of SolarCity, as well as the announcement of nearly 400,000 advance deposits for the Model 3.makeArticleAd();Now, fresh off of the holiday season, traders are bidding Tesla stock up on a deal withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY)to dropmore than 30 billion yen(about $256 million USD) on a Tesla production facility to make photovoltaic cells and modules.Today's 3%-plus move exemplifies the broader theme - TSLA stock is erratic. In 2016, Tesla had a range of $144 to $265 - with the year-to-date loss coming to 8%. That's disappointing considering the markets have ended the year on a very bullish note. It's important to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock has had a long run of strong gains. During the past five years, compound annual growth hit a staggering 50%.10 Best Stocks for Retirement InvestorsSo what kind of opportunity are we looking at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let's consider three pros and cons on Tesla stock.TSLA Stock ProsInnovation:Tesla Motors has made major breakthroughs in battery technologies (allowing for drives of over 300 miles on a single charge), electric powertrains and software systems. Yet the company has also been innovative with its business model, such as having online purchases of vehicles as well company-owned showrooms and service centers. The result is that Tesla has direct connections with its customers and better control on quality service.Interestingly enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are periodic updates to the systems with""over-the-air""transmissions. This has definitely been key with the Autopilot technology, which allows for semi-autonomous driver assistance. So is it any wonder thatForbescurrently ranks Tesla asthe world's most innovative company? Not really.Megatrend:The auto industry is in the midst of major technology changes. Companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) have made big investments and acquisitions in the category. Of course, the main focus is on autonomous driving. According to research fromMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY), the market could hit$15 billionwithin the next few years.All this is certainly good news for holders of TSLA stock. The company has been investing in new-fangled auto technologies since 2003. What's more, the Autopilot hardware has logged over 1.3 billion miles so far. In other words, Tesla has a major advantage in terms of data and analytics. But the growth is likely to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expects to ship50,000 cars, which is roughly the same amount for all of last year.The Elon Factor:At 45, Musk is already a legend of the tech industry. Besides Tesla, he has launched other breakout companies, such as Zip2,Paypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL), SolarCity and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk has made billions for shareholders. Unlike many in Silicon Valley, though, he is not only technically super smart but has incredible marketing chops. Oh, and he is not afraid of ""going big."" Let's face it, how many people have the goal of eventually living on Mars? Such qualities have inspired Musk's workforce, which has led to amazing achievements.TSLA Stock ConsSolarCity Deal:OnTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), Musk sent out thefollowingregarding the acquisition: ""Tesla + SolarCity future: solar roofs + batteries + electric cars."" Definitely ambitious, right? Of course. But there has still been quite a bit of skepticism on the Street.One of the issues is that SolarCity has been a big-time money loser. For the past year, the company has reported nearly$2 billion in negative operating cash flows. Keep in mind that there are heavy capital costs and marketing expenditures. The competitive environment is also intense and there are concerns that the regulatory environment could get tougher. Let's face it, the Donald Trump Administration may not be too interested in maintaining tax credits for solar energy projects.In light of all this, analysts at Morgan Stanley provided the followinggrim assessment: ""Given (SolarCity's) financial condition and recent reduction in guidance, we have assumed zero value for (SolarCity) equity to (Tesla) shareholders.""Valuation:Even with the recent drop, TSLA stock is still far from cheap. The multiple is at about six times sales. No doubt, this is at quite a premium to traditional auto manufacturers. Consider thatGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) sport multiples at about 0.3 or so.It's true that the premium valuation for TSLA is due to the strong growth ramp. And there is lots of value for the intellectual property. But then again, profitability has remained elusive. If anything, TSLA will likely continue to voraciously raise capital to meet production targets, build the massive Gigafactory and fund SolarCity. In other words, there will likely be ongoing dilution for shareholders.Perhaps this is why short sellers have been targeting TSLA stock. Right now, the short interest is at a hefty 40% of the float, which certainly indicates that many investors are expecting a fall in the value of the shares.Production Issues:Demand has not really been a problem for Tesla. Instead, the real challenge has been to produce enough vehicles. After all, the company has a limited number of facilities - and technical complexities are mind-boggling. It seems inevitable that there will be snags. Yet the biggest problem may be to achieve profitability on a unit basis. According to a recent 152-slide presentation from hedge fund managerMark Spiegel, the Tesla Model 3 could cost $48,000 to produce. However, the company has plans to sell it at $35,000!All in all, this seems like a pretty good deal for customers - but not for holders of TSLA stock. Granted, TSLA may ultimately decide to hike the price. But this could mean a drop in sales.

Will Tesla's (TSLA) Share Price Rebound In 2017?;12/27/2016;"Tesla Motors, Inc.'sTSLAstock, which was once a market favorite, has been underperforming this year. The share price had surged 344.1% in 2013 and 47.9% in 2014. However, the increase slowed down to 7.9% in 2015.The stock has lost 11.1% so far this year. Tesla has been facing production related issues for a long time, as a result of which it has failed to meet delivery targets in the first two quarters of 2016. This, along with the losses incurred by the company, pulled down its share price. Tesla's stock was also affected by the announcement of the SolarCity acquisition, due to concerns regarding the losses of the latter, debts and cash outflow.As a result, Tesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for most of the year. Year to date, the industry witnessed a 2.9% gain, which is in sharp contrast to the losses recorded by Tesla.Is a Rebound on the Cards?Tesla will belaunching its first affordable car, Model 3, in 2017, aiding the company to rebound, provided the launch is on schedule. The biggest criticism against the company has been its consistent losses. CEO Elon Musk is of the opinion that Tesla is unlikely to achieve sustained net profits until Model 3 enters its full-scale production.While the company's expansion into the battery storage business helped it to lower losses to some extent, a change in the earnings reporting method helped it post a profit in the third quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, the company is still expected to record losses in 2016 and 2017.Thus, the successful launch of Model 3 will play a key role in determining Tesla's performance next year. Since its partial unveiling, the car has seen strong demand and the company is likely to need at least an year to fulfill the number of pre-orders it has received. This means that Tesla's plan to increase production capacity also needs to be achieved on schedule. The company is planning to complete the acquisition of Grohmann Engineering early next year to help it reach the production capacity goals.Apart from Model 3, Tesla's energy business will also play an important role in determining its profitability. While the Tesla Energy business is already generating positive gross margins, thelaunch of the new solar roof shinglesmight further augment the profitability.Tesla also hasseveral products in development stage, including heavy-duty trucks, to be named Tesla Semi, and high passenger-density urban transport, i.e. minibuses. It is also developing a compact SUV, to be named Model Y.Additionally, Tesla plans to charge a small fee for the use of its Superchargers from customers who purchase a Model X or Model S after Jan 1, 2017. Though revenues from this source will be limited, it is likely to augment the bottom line.The recentacquisition of SolarCityis expected to help Tesla attain savings of $150 million in 2017. However, the addition of SolarCity's debts and cash outflows will increase the strain on Tesla's financials.Moreover, Tesla is investing heavily in increasing its production capacity, the development of Model X and Model 3, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure. As a result, itsexpenses are expected to remain highin 2017, which will weigh on the bottom line.Overall, with several positive developments lined up, Tesla's stock is likely to perform well in 2017. The shares might get a boost if the company posts positive fourth quarter earnings report. However, a lot more depends on the timely launch of Model 3 and expansion of its non-automotive business.TESLA MOTORS PriceTESLA MOTORS Price|TESLA MOTORS QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 Stocks to Watch on Tuesday: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL), Apple Inc (AAPL) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt was a quiet weekend, with most companies celebrating the   holiday period by making any announcements they may have before   the weekend or later in the week.

As far as management pilot goes, the largest payout could   amount to about $192,000.The company responded by noting that there are two types of   pilots that are being bunched together by the union, one of which   reap the benefits of a profit-sharing plan established in   March.The other is a management-based incentive program that kicks   in if the company nets $3.5 billion in the year, but individual   performances are also assessed with the plan.AAL shares are up 15.1% year-to-date.Apple Inc (AAPL)Apple is releasing three phones in the near future,the company announced.The tech giant revealed that it is celebrating the tenth   anniversary of its flagship smartphone with the launch of   upgraded versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Bank of America Corp (BAC) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street   remains relatively barren. While the markets are open for   business, many traders will remain on holiday break through the   start of next year. The 20,000 mark for theDow Jones Industrial Averageremains a dream for many bulls, however, and the blue-chip   barometer has a slim chance of topping that hurdle due to light   volume this week.At last check, futures on the Dow were up 0.02%, withS&P 500futures up 0.12%.Nasdaq-100futures were also up by 0.14%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, volume was well below average on Dec. 23   - the last trading session ahead of the Christmas break. Only   about 8.2 million calls and 7.9 million puts changed hands on the   session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume   ratio dipped to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average ticked   higher to 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw an unusual level of put volume on Friday after Consumer   Reports snubbed the new MacBook Pro. Elsewhere,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) unloaded the last of its international credit card business toLloyds Banking Group PLC (ADR)(NYSE:LYG) andTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was upgraded at Vetr.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL stock may be in for a spot of short-term weakness, if the   worsening sentiment in the options pits is any indication. On   Friday, AAPL saw more than 603,000 contracts cross the tape - a   considerable accomplishment given the overall low volume on the   day. What's disturbing is that puts claimed the majority of the   day's activity with 51% of the take.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017With any other stock, this wouldn't be much of an issue, but   with AAPL, which typically sees calls account for 63% to 64% of   daily volume, it was a considerable sentiment blow. Additionally,   there was news driving the added put volume, asConsumer Reports tested the new MacBook Proand failed to give the laptop a ""recommended"" buy rating - the   first time any Apple MacBook has failed to grab the coveted   rating.With AAPL stock trading just below resistance at $116, and   sentiment sliding, we could see considerable selling pressure on   the shares once the rest of Wall Street returns to work next   week.Bank of America Corp (BAC)BAC continues to ride high among both stock and options   traders.  The shares saw option volume rise to 375,000   contracts on Friday, with calls making up 66% of the day's   activity. What's more, according toTrade-Alert.com, BAC's weekly December 30 strike 24 calls attracted significant   call buying activity, with a block of 5,000 contracts crossing at   the strike for the ask price of a penny, or $1.00 per   contract.The play seems highly speculative - especially given the   holiday shortened trading week - but there are several drivers   that could help vault BAC to fresh highs.For instance, Bank of America announced that it is unloading   the last of its international credit card interestto Lloyds Banking Group for $2.35 billion. The sale marks the end of BofA's activity in the international   credit card market, and the company can now focus its efforts on   its core businesses. Speaking of which, Bank of America's   investing unit is looking at three potential rate hikes from the   Federal Reserve in 2017.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)TSLA stock received a double bump last week - one sentiment   and one technical. On the sentiment front,Vetr upgraded TSLA stockto ""hold"" from ""sell."" While the move drew little fanfare, it was   enough to spark technical buying as the shares topped resistance   at $210. Tesla is now pinned against its 200-day moving average -   a trendline the shares last closed a session above in August.Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.       (ULTA) Stock Is GlisteningA breakout here could be quite bullish for the shares, and   TSLA options traders appear to be banking on the move. On Friday,   Tesla saw volume of more than 203,000 contracts, with calls   snapping up 53% of the day's take, which, given traders' recent   preference for TSLA puts, is a significant shift in sentiment for   the shares.Looking out to January 2017 options, peak call open interest   lies at $230, totaling roughly 10,680 contracts. The next closest   significant call accumulation numbers 5,800 contracts at $220. In   other words, there is little in the way of overhead   options-related resistance to slow TSLA down should the shares   finally reclaim their 200-day trendline.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017The postTuesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

2 Big Winners in Consumer Reports' Owner Satisfaction Survey;12/27/2016;"It's easy for investors to become completely consumed by a   company's financials, and that's obviously an important aspect of   investing. But wise investors also pay a lot of attention to the   products their companies make, because a product mistake or   failure could send a promising company's stock crashing to the   ground.That's why reading through Consumer Reports' Annual Owner   Satisfaction Survey can be really important for auto investors:   It tells us how CR subscribers feel about the cars they bought.   I'd much rather own a financially healthy stock that produces   vehicles consumers would buy again, than not.Lincoln's rebound isn't limited to sales as its consumer   satisfaction jumped this year. Image source: Ford Motor   Company.makeArticleAd();How does it work?CR's rankings emphasize owner sentiment across a brand's   entire portfolio of vehicles and model satisfaction is determined   by the percentage of subscribers that would ""definitely"" buy the   vehicle again. Also, in order to qualify, a brand must have at   least two models with data and the survey focused on 2014-2017   model years. Without further ado, here are the results and some   takeaways.Information source: Consumer Reports'Ownership Satisfaction Survey. Chart by author.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is obviously a huge winner here as the only brand   scoring in the 90 percentile range, and well ahead of the next   closest brand, Porsche, and that's even more impressive   considering the latter was the only brand scoring in the 80   percentile range. But Tesla's victory here is even more important   considering the battering it's taken over the past year in   regards to production issues.The Model X's wing doors caused consumer frustration, and   occasional issues of doors not aligning properly aren't typical   complaints for a car that can cost well into the $100,000 range.   The fact that so many Tesla consumers would purchase again   despite the production complaints is a huge win, and that's   amplified by the fact that it's more affordable Model 3 will be   launching at the end of 2017.Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F) luxury Lincoln brand made an impressive jump for the   second-largest Detroit automaker. Lincoln jumped from its 21st   ranking in the prior CR survey, up to 12th this year. That moved   Lincoln ahead of some notable luxury brands such as Cadillac,   Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Remember, Lincoln was the only brand that   Ford didn't sell off amid its business crisis in 2006, and the   following financial crisis. It's poured much capital into   reviving the luxury brand and it's now on pace for its third   consecutive year of sales gains, something it hasn't accomplished   in at least 16 years.This is a great sign for Ford investors as luxury sales are   high margin business, and increasing luxury sales at a time when   new-vehicle sales are peaking would be very beneficial for the   automaker. If more consumers are happy with the product, and   would purchase again as this survey indicates, this suggests   Lincoln's newest products are improved and that should enable the   brand's rebound to continue.Ultimately, these types of surveys are more important to   investors than many realize. The automotive business is insanely   competitive, and it's very costly to ""conquer"" consumers, which   is luring them from a competing brand to your own. If you have a   high percentage of consumers remaining loyal to your brand, it's   simply good business. These surveys can also give a glimpse of a   company that might not be producing vehicles up to standards, and   that could lead to sales troubles in the near-term. TakeFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor example, which had four of its five brands place 17th or   lower. Wise investors should use these surveys to their   advantage, and consider them while making investing   decisions.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Elon Musk Really Build a Tunnel Boring Company?;12/25/2016;"So here's the latest revelation pulled out of ""Elon Musk's box   of crazy ideas."" The founder ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX has now decided to start a company that   will dig tunnels for cars to drive through.Tunnel boring machines are massive pieces of equipment --   train-sized mobile factories designed to dig into the Earth.   Coincidentally, they're almost perfectly shaped to fit aboard a   rocket to Mars. Image source: Getty Images.We first learned of Musk's latest harebrained scheme (Get it?   Rabbits dig tunnels. too!) when the Tesla CEO was apparently   driving through California over the weekend, got upset with the   holiday-time traffic, and began blasting out a series of   tweets:makeArticleAd();""Traffic is driving me nuts,"" observed the billionaire.So maybe he should ""build a tunnel boring machine and just   start digging.""He would call the company ""The Boring Company"" -- and he is   ""actually going to do this.""A hare among foxesMedia response to the Tesla tycoon's tweets has been mixed,   withUSA Todayobserving that these may be the mere ""musings of a guy stuck in a   traffic jam with time to tweet,"" andRecode.net theorizingthat Elon was ""just venting,"" or perhaps ""making a corny   joke.""Others, including some of my own colleagues here at The Motley   Fool, believe that Musk is serious about setting up a ""boring   company"" -- but that he's deluded if he thinks he can make it   work. After all, while the idea of boring tunnels in the earth   appears to have just occurred to Musk, there are plenty of other   companies that have been at this business much longer.Just a quick survey of the tunnel boring machine (TBM)   industry reveals major players in the form of:Norway's TerratecGermany's Bosch RexrothGermany's Herrenknecht, which makes the TBMs building out     the London UndergroundJapan's Hitachi Zosen Sakai, which makes the Bertha     TBM currently tunneling under SeattleChina Rail Engineering CorporationFrance's NFM Technologies and America's The Robbins     Company, both now owned  by China's Northern Heavy     Industries GroupIf Elon Musk truly desires to enter the tunnel boring   business, he's going to face some stiff competition --   competition stiff enough that it's already drivenCaterpillar(NYSE: CAT) out of the business. (Caterpillar stopped building   TBMs in 2013, and is winding down its support of existing   equipment at the end of this year.) So if Musk truly is serious   about setting up a tunnel boring company, he's picked himself a   tough row to hoe.Crazy as a March hare -- or crazy like a fox?And yet, I actually think Muskisserious -- and what's more, I think I knowwhyhe's serious about tunnel boring. It comes down to this:   Everything -- everything -- that Musk does these days is done   with an eye to his dream ofone day colonizing Mars.Consider: Musk has famously advocated the idea of launching   satellites into orbit, and thenreusing the rockets. Previously, advocates of reusable rockets always argued that   the best way to land rockets for reuse was to fly them back to   Earth and land them like an airplane, on a runway. That's how   Rockwell International (now largely owned byBoeing) designed its space shuttle. That's how Boeing rivalAirbusis designingits ADELINE spaceplaneto land today.Musk, however, rightly points out that on Mars, thereare no runways.If you want to land a rocket on Mars, such that it can later take   off again, you have to land ""on your feet."" Hence, every rocket   that Musk makes at SpaceX is designed to land vertically, on its   own rockets.You can make a similar point for Musk's other business   ventures, includingSolarCity solar panels, Teslaelectric cars, and evensatellite internet. Mars lacks oil deposits, which means that power must be   generated electrically (solar panels). Mars cars won't be able to   run on gasoline, so battery power is a better option there as   well (Tesla). And Mars will lack a communications system to   connect potentially far-flung colonies -- so it might be a good   idea to develop expertise in running a satcom network here on   Earth, preparatory to creating a similar system to encircle   Mars.Making sense of Elon Musk's Boring CompanySo how do tunnel boring machines play into this Mars-centric   thesis? Simple. In the early days of any Mars colony, protecting   colonists from solar radiation will be a concern, as will   construction of housing. Having tunnel boring machines on site,   however, would solve both problems at once, by enabling colonists   to bore radiation-proof tunnels underground in which to live.Mind you, I'm not saying that this is Musk'sonlyobjective in setting up a company to build TBMs. Rather, it's hisultimateobjective.As I see it, Musk needs to figure out how to build TBMs --   which he can then ship to Mars by rocket, for use in setting up a   Mars colony. To do that, he'll want to first tinker with the   idea, learn how to build TBMs himself, and then perfect the   technology. By setting up a ""Boring Company"" on Earth, he gets to   do all three -- and have his customers (and perhaps even   investors) pay for it.When you look at things this way, Musk's idea isn't nearly as   crazy as it sounds.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;12/23/2016;"The end of the year is usually quiet for most businesses, but   for the solar industry it can be a time of big changes.   Legislation and regulatory changes are often pushed through just   before the end of the year, which has had a huge impact on the   solar industry in years past.2016 is no different, and there are some significant policy   changes taking place right now. But this time solar energy may be   coming out on top. Here's a look at those policy changes and some   other notable items from the week in solar energy.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.A record year for U.S. solarDespite solar stocks' performance on the market, the industry   had a record year in 2016. The U.S. Energy Information   Administration (EIA) says that 9.5 GW of utility-scale solar will   be installed in the U.S. this year, enough to power 1.5 million   homes. That tops 8.0 GW of new natural gas plants and 6.8 GW of   new wind power.If you add in distributed solar generation, which the EIA   doesn't account for, the figure jumps to 11.2 GW or 14 GW of DC   power generation,according to GTM Research. The future is bright for solar energy, and as the biggest   source of new power generation in the country, it's finally a   power player in electricity generation.States can't figure out what to do with solarThe rooftop solar industry is very dependent on state and   regulator policies driving the economics of solar systems. Under   net metering, customers only pay for their net energy usage,   meaning they're effectively ""paid"" the retail rate for energy   they export to the grid. Not surprisingly, utilities have tried   to undercut that economic model in a variety of ways over the   last few years.This week, Arizona undercut net metering by lowering the rate   customers are paid for electricity sent to the grid, and cutting   down the amount of time rates are guaranteed. This reduces the   known payback of a solar system and could make it difficult to   justify rooftop solar.In Nevada, the state that eliminated net metering a year ago   in a very punitive way to the solar industry, the Public   Utilities Commission unanimously approved utility Sierra Pacific   Power's bid to restore net metering in the northern part of the   state. This is a big reversal in Nevada, and may show that   regulators went too far in their ruling last year.Utilities in the southwestern U.S. are finding themselves in a   difficult position as the cost of rooftop solar falls and energy   storage becomes more viable. They're trying to undercut the   economics of solar, but by doing so they're making solar plus   storage a viable option for self-consumption. It's no coincidence   that this is the yearTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) introduced new or improved energy-storage products.   Utilities are having a hard time finding a balance between   fighting rooftop solar and fighting so hard they push customers   toward solar plus storage. And that conflict is playing out in   plain sight in Arizona and Nevada right now.News and notesHere are a few notable items from around the solar   industry.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) said this week that it hit a new efficiency record of   22.61% for a monocrystalline silicon PERC cell. Mono-PERC, as   it's more commonly known, is an up-and-coming technology that   will likely gain market share in the next few years, so being in   a leadership position is good for the company.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) said it completed a 20 MW power plant for the   Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative this week. The   project completion itself isn't surprising, but buried in the   release is that 0.5 MW of the installation was the company's   Oasis 3.0 platform that was launched in September. Putting the   system in the ground will both give SunPower the chance to test   installing it, and allow data to be collected from the project.   Since it is probably the company's most important product over   the next five years, this is an important test site for the   company.Private company 8minutenergy Renewables also completed a 155   MW project that it says beats fossil-fuel prices and is the   lowest-cost solar power to date. The $58 per MWh it is charging   the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for electricity   over a 30-year power purchase agreement is impressive, and it's   just one example of low-cost solar in the U.S. New contracts are   going for less than $50 per MWh, and 2017 could see prices below   $40 per MWh, which would make solar energy lower-cost than fossil   fuels in most of the country.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

This increase comes only a couple of months after CEO Elon Musk stated that the company would not need to raise any additional capital or debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 (read more:Tesla Unlikely to Raise Capital in 2016 for Proposed Merger).However, on Dec 15, Tesla amended the ABL Credit Agreement, dated Jun 10, 2015, with Deutsche Bank. As a result, the revolving credit under the agreement has increased by $200 million with provisions to raise it by another $50 million. The company's subsidiaries Tesla Finance LLC and Tesla 2014 Warehouse SPV LLC also amended the Loan and Security Agreement, dated Aug 31, 2016, with Deutsche Bank to increase the maximum facility limit under the agreement by $300 million.

Do Lithium Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio?;12/23/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The case for lithium stocks seems simple enough. The world is   adding new portable electric devices at an incredible pace. Just   about every major automaker has at least announced plans for   introducing an electric vehicle to the market within a matter of   years. A little company calledTeslais moving forward on construction of a Gigafactory that will   produce an enormous number of batteries for autos and home-scale   energy storage -- it expects to produce as many lithium-ion   batteries in 2018 as were manufactured on the whole planet in   2013. Phones, laptops, power tools, wearables, drones -- it seems   everything and anything is taking advantage of advances in   lithium-ion technology.makeArticleAd();That means lithium stocks belong in your portfolio, right? As   is usually the case, the details of the market make this simple   argument a little more complicated. Here are a few things   investors will want to consider before throwing money at the   companies supplying this headline-grabbing metal.The lithium market by the numbersEveryone thinks of batteries when they think of lithium.   However, while that is by far the fastest-growing use for the   metal, batteries only account for about one-third of the total   lithium market. They only became the largest category of   consumption last year, when they moved ahead of ceramics and   glass.Image source:USGS.Counterintuitively, global production of lithium ore hasn't   grown all that much in recent years, although mining companies   are planning on major output increases in the near future. The   U.S. Geological Survey concluded that 2013 output topped out at   34,000 metric tons, then fell to 31,700 metric tons in 2014.   Production of raw ore is estimated to have grown by just 500   metric tons in 2015.Sluggish production growth is not a matter of scarcity. Global   output could triple and known reserves would still last about 135   years. The question iswhether or not lithium suppliers can keep up(more on that below) with rising demand. This should be the focus   of investors interested in lithium stocks.Lithium market structureThere are plenty of tiny, zero-revenue stocks out there   claiming to have vast reserves of untapped lithium ore. These are   the crazy Uncle Joes of the market. Smile, nod, and then turn   your attention to the suppliers with real market share.Albemarle Corp.(NYSE: ALB) ,Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile(NYSE: SQM) , andFMC Corp.(NYSE: FMC) own a combined 70% of the global lithium market.   China's Tianqi Lithium owns another 16%. These diverse specialty   chemical companies buy up the rights to unmined lithium and   convert it into more refined grades that are suitable for   downstream customers, such as battery manufacturers.These companies are only real way to gain exposure to the   market. There is no reliable pure play lithium stock. Why not?   Mining lithium is an awfully slow and laborious operation.Consider that some 80% of global lithium reserves are to be   found in salt brines in South America, namely Chile and   Argentina, with over half of the world's reserves residing in the   former. Getting the raw lithium out of brine requires multiple   concentration, extraction, and purification steps to separate out   various other metal impurities. The first step alone -- solar   evaporation ponds -- takesfour months. The next several steps are energy and consumable intensive,   which hikes  the cost of production.Image source:Outotec.To put it another way: Uncle Joe isn't going to make it in   lithium mining. The process is long and expensive, which prevents   suppliers from responding rapidly to shifts in demand. Only large   companies such as Albemarle, SQM, and FMC have the financial   power to withstand volatility, diversify their supply chains, and   make the necessary investments to create high grade lithium   materials for industrial customers. Of course, market volatility   has worked in their favor in the last year.Supply and demandNow that I've convinced you to stay away from microcap lithium   stocks, you're ready to load up on the blue chips. After all, the   growing demand for batteries and the sluggish rises in raw ore   output (a year-over-year increase in output of just 500 metric   tons) must give the four major market players the upper hand in   negotiating supply deals with battery manufacturers, right?Sort of.ALBdata byYChartsIt goes without saying that lithium is pretty important in   lithium-ion batteries. But, counterintuitively, the lithium does   not have a significant impact on the cost of lithium-ion   batteries. In fact, it's actually the smallest mass and cost   component of the battery cells. Earlier this year, two   researchers at Carnegie Mellon University did a study that played   around with the price of lithium carbonate (raw lithium ore),   using a base price of $7.50 per kilogram. Dropping the price to   $0 and increasing it to $25 per kilogram -- an increase of 233%   --changed the cost of batteries by less than   10%.In other words, there isn't much bargaining power to gain from   keeping the market undersupplied, but the lengthy production   process for lithium has kept supply lagging behind demand in the   last several years. That has resulted in rising prices, which   have been a boon for the Big Four in 2016. Here's how lithium   contributed to the finances of Albemarle and FMC for the first   nine months of 2016:MetricAlbemarleFMCRevenue, lithium$689.9 million*$193.5 million% of Total Revenue34.8%*8%Income, lithium$186.3 million (net income)*$48.9 million**% of Total Income32.6% (net income)*12.1%***Includes other materials. **Income before taxes. Source: SEC   filings.In its financial reports, Albemarle lumps lithium sales in   with other advanced materials it sells, but lithium is clearly   driving the segment. The year-over-year sales increase for the   segment was all from favorable conditions in the lithium market,   which offset declining revenue from other products. FMC has seen   a significant leap in lithium sales compared to 2015, too, and   has announced major expansion plans to increase output before the   end of the decade.Keep in mind that the lengthy production process is a   double-edged sword. If demand for raw lithium suddenly craters,   perhaps in a global economic downturn or from the emergence of   new mining technology, then major suppliers will be nearly two   quarters behind the market's appetite. A similar scenario could   unfold if other major mining or chemical companies decide to   invest in production or the overall supply chain. Either case   could crash prices and the income statements of lithium stocks in   one fell swoop. That doesn't appear likely at the moment, but   similar scenarios have played out many times in commodities   markets when no one saw it coming in advance. (See: fertilizers,   crude oil, and the like.)Do lithium stocks belong in your portfolio?Investors will want to take the issues outlined above   into consideration before making a decision to gain exposure   to lithium, either directly through a supplier such as Albemarle   or indirectly through an ETF. In the end, the lithium market   is more complex than most people realize. I'm firmly in the camp   that thinks lithium stocks are simply the flavor the week for Mr.   Market and do not represent a long-term buying opportunity.   Perhaps when supply chains mature and prices reach more of an   equilibrium, I'll reconsider my position. But for now, lithium   stocks do not belong in my portfolio.10 stocks we like better than FMCWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Is Closer to Deploying Its Enhanced Autopilot;12/22/2016;"When electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) launched its next-generation suite of Autopilot   sensors in October, there was one immediate caveat in the big   update: Tesla vehicles with the new hardware would temporarily   lack key Autopilot features already in cars with its   first-generation sensor suite. Missing abilities even included   important safety features like automatic emergency braking and   collision warning. Tesla said it would need to further calibrate   the system before it caught Autopilot 2.0 up with Autopilot 1.0.   But the new system is almost ready, according to a tweet from   Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday.Tesla demonstrates Autopilot 2.0 sensors. Image source: Tesla   Motors.makeArticleAd();Validation""Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well,"" Musk   said onTwitter, referencing the new system's onboard computer, which has 40   times the computing power of its predecessor and runs the   company's Tesla Vision neural-net software (developed   in-house) for sonar and radar processing. ""Just need to get   a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of   environments.""In late November, Musk said Tesla would begin rolling out   updates for its new Autopilot sensors to catch the new technology   up with the capabilities of its existing sensor suite in   December. The updates, Musk tweeted, ""will get rolled out   incrementally in monthly releases.""Tesla's first-generation Autopilot still includes a long list   of driver-assist features that Autopilot 2.0 doesn't have yet,   including parking assist, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot   detection, auto-steer, auto-park, summoning, side-collision   warning, and more.Earlier this month, Musk said the ""Tesla software team is   working seven days a week to complete testing and validation"" and   that the team was ""[g]etting close.""Tesla's advantageHow Tesla goes about validating a totally new set of sensors   using a new computing system will make an intriguing story. If   the company really can begin catching up its new sensor suite   starting in December, it would highlight Tesla's ability to   quickly generate and organize significant real-world data and   rapidly deploy improvements to its fleet.A new Autopilot sensor in the side pillar of one of Tesla's   vehicles. Image source: Tesla Motors.When Tesla began shipping its vehicles with its   first-generation Autopilot sensors in 2014, it took a full year   before the company was ready to beam an over-the-air software   update to its fleet for automatic steering. Bringing significant   features to Autopilot 2.0 this quickly, therefore, would put the   spotlight on the company's growing prowess in generating useful   data from its sensors, and deploying software updates to take   advantage of them.While Musk's reference to needing ""a lot of road time"" is   vague, the CEO's previous promise to start catching up Autopilot   2.0 to 1.0 in December implies he doesn't expect it to take much   longer. With fourth-quarter deliveries -- all of which include   new Autopilot sensors -- expected to be up about 44% year over   year (and equal to about half of the company's total deliveries   last year), Tesla's higher sales volume undoubtedly helps by   giving the company more vehicles to collect data from. But the   company's growing experience in organizing vehicle data, and   Autopilot 2.0's more powerful computer and software, are likely   also key catalysts in helping Tesla refine the system.Over time, Tesla expects its Autopilot 2.0 capabilities to far   exceed Autopilot 1.0. Tesla says the updated cars have all the   sensors they need to totally drive themselves in the future. Of   course, to get to this point Tesla will need to continue to   validate and refine the system. In addition, Tesla will   need to obtain regulatory approval to enable its cars to   drive themselves.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons NVIDIA Corporation Stock Could Rise;12/22/2016;"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)  has made some impressive moves in 2016 that   have won the company a lot of analyst attention and upgrades --   and rightfully so. The company's ability to challenge industry   giants to grow in many of the most exciting and potentially   high-growth sectors in the tech market could lead to much more   growth in the future. Here are three ways NVIDIA stock could   continue rising.Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();1. More big partnership announcementsNVIDIA has its hands in a lot of segments, but it still gets   most of its revenue from GPUs (graphic processing units). NVIDIA   announced this year that it will be the chip provider forMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) new Surface Studio. This high-end and high-power   computer is undoubtedly going to be one of the industry   news-makers when it's available broadly starting in early   2017.Another exciting partnership announcement this year for NVIDIA   was thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) said in late October that it had ended its   relationship withMobileye, and would be switching to NVIDIA's technology instead.   NVIDIA's automated driving technology is quickly becoming   one of the industry standards, and NVIDIA has now signed deals   with various car companies to get its infotainment and driverless   technology in new generations of connected cars. More big   partnerships like these in 2017 are likely to also send the stock   higher.NVIDIA technology in a MINI Cooper. Image source: NVIDIA.2. VR adoptionOther than autonomous cars, virtual reality (VR) has been a   hot topic in the tech industry in 2016. Its potential uses   in personal media, video games, and even video conferencing   for business meetings has led analysts atDigi-Capitalto predict that the industry could be worth $120 billion by   2020.That would be great news for NVIDIA, which is already one of   the most important names in the space for providing high-power   graphics chips for computers, and especially laptops, to make   them VR-ready. Earlier this year, only a small fraction of   laptops had VR capabilities, but NVIDIA is quickly changing that   by rolling out graphics processors for laptops that are closing   the gap with desktops -- a good sign for gaming and VR adoption.   To speed things up, NVIDIA recently started offering a bundle of   free VR games when users buy NVIDIA graphics hardware. Getting   some good numbers on how much this VR trend is adopted in 2017   should provide analysts reason to upgrade this portion of   NVIDIA's business.3. Another earnings beatIn NVIDIA's most recent quarter, the company posted earnings   per share of $0.83, far ahead of analyst expectations, that sent   the stock surging. This is nothing new for this high-performing   company that consistently beats on earnings and gets a share   price bump each time.NVDAdata byYCharts.It will get harder and harder for the company to keep making   these kinds of earnings beats since analysts will start to   consider so much growth the norm for NVIDIA and begin increasing   their forecasts for the next quarter. Already, Q4 estimates are   high, but if history is any indication, NVIDIA could very well   beat those again, which would likely send the stock higher.Should you wait for a pullback in 2017?NVIDIA has had an incredible 2016, both in terms of smart   moves made by the company, and also by share price growth, which   is up 220% so far in 2016. NVIDIA stock now trades at 67   times earnings, and it has quickly become one of the most   expensive companies in its sector. As we've seen time and time   again, that could mean a slight pullback in the year ahead at the   first sign of growth slowing as the company matures.Still, if you want to buy in but are waiting for a pullback,   consider that shares are trading at just 39 times next   year's earnings estimates because of how quickly earnings are   expected to keep growing, meaning if the company performs on the   bottom line throughout 2017, it could gain substantially before   any pullback. Therefore, it's probably better to take the long   approach with this company and invest for where it might grow to   in the next five or 10 years.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Let Everyone Else Worry About Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;12/22/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt's no secret that I am not a fan ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). I like the cars, but not the stock. I think that Wall Street   has priced in several perfect scenarios. I am not one to bet on   pure ""hopium"" and risk money with aspirations that all goes   well.Click to EnlargeLuckily, the options market makes it possible to trade TSLA   without betting the farm one way or the other. As opposed to   risking my money at current prices, I can structure options   trades with room for error.makeArticleAd();I have good results trading TSLA using ranges. Whenever   possible, I sell risk against those ranges. So in essence, I sell   lottery tickets to other hopeful traders. I do my homework and   set the trades outside of the ranges then let time do the trick.   When selling spreads, theta is my friend.3 Stocks That Could Get Pounded by Tax Loss       SellingSince I don't want to reinvent the wheel, today I will reset   the same trade that paid me last time. I collected about 80 cents   per contract for selling a TSLA iron condor. The trade was a   complete win without any trouble.The Trade:Sell the TSLA March $160/$155 credit put spread. This is a   bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract. If   successful, this trade yields 12% on money risked. The 20% price   buffer gives this trade a 90% theoretical chance of success.Usually I like to hedge my trades. In this case I want to find   an opposing bearish trade to balance my TSLA portfolio.The Hedge (Optional):Sell the TSLA March $255/$260 credit call spread. This is a   bearish trade for which I collect 45 cents per contract. To win,   I need TSLA stock to stay below the spread. With the current   price buffer, I have a 90% theoretical chance of succeeding. The   potential yield on this side alone is 9% on money risked.Taking both trades leaves me short an iron condor. This is a   range-bound trade where I need TSLA stock to stay between both   spreads sold through expiration. If successful, the overall yield   of the iron condor jumps to over 20% on money risked. Why?   Because I can only lose on one side or the other. The drawback of   having both sides is that I would risk loss in either   direction.3 Big ""Moat"" Stocks Paying Investors 5% (TUP,       IRM, VTR)The Twist:The March contract would include a TSLA earnings report. For some   people this is a scary proposition. So I can set a similar trade,   but for the Jan. 27 contract. The buffer from current price would   need to tighten but would still be viable. An example would be   TSLA Jan. 27 iron condor. I sell a $180/$175 credit put spread   opposed a $235/$240  credit call spread. I collect a net   premium of about 90 cents per contract.I am not required to hold these trades through expiration.

"Auto Stock Roundup: Winnebago Beats on Earnings; GM, Ford to Trim Production Level";12/22/2016;"The auto sector had a mixed week in terms of developments, although the performance of stocks was mostly positive. Winnebago Industries, Inc.WGOsurpassed earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while Toyota Motor CorporationTMprojected 1% global sales growth for 2017.Meanwhile, General Motors CompanyGMannounced new investments as well as plans to temporarily stop production in a few U.S. plants. Even Ford Motor Co.Frevealed plans to pause production in Venezuela.Additionally, Honda Motor Co., Ltd.HMCannounced that it is in discussion with Waymo for a self-driving collaboration.Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1. Winnebago reported adjusted earnings of 60 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Nov 26, 2016), higher than 32 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. Revenues for the first quarter increased 14.5% to $245.3 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $221 million. The year-over-year increase in top line was due to strong growth in the towables business.Winnebago currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Toyota expects global sales to increase by 1% to 10.2 million vehicles in 2017 over its projection for 2016, triggered by higher sales in North America, China, Europe and Asia. Launch of new models, including the C-HR compact sport utility vehicle, will drive sales for the automaker. These benefits will offset sluggish demand in the Middle East due to lowoil prices(read more:Toyota Projects Global Sales Increase of 1% for 2017).Currently, Toyota has a Zacks Rank #3.3.General Motors announced plans to invest around $552 million in the U.S.mainly for upgrading manufacturing facilities in Tonawanda, Lockport and Rochester located in New York and Parma Metal center in Ohio.

Per the discussions, Honda will provide modified vehicles, which will be integrated with Waymo's self-driving technology and become part of the latter's test fleet.Honda currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.5. Ford halted production in Venezuela last week and said that it will not restart it before next April. This decision has been taken in the wake of sluggish demand for new cars in South America. The shutdown will affect around 2,000 workers. This temporary halt in production is not likely to affect Ford's results as the company reports its Venezuela operations separately (read more:Ford Halts Production in Venezuela till April on Weak Demand).Ford carries a Zacks Rank #3.PerformanceThe strong performance of the overall equity market pulled up all auto stocks over the last week.

Image source: Lucid   Motors.What Lucid said about the LG Chem dealIn a statement, Lucid said the new agreement ""establishes LG   Chem asone ofthe key suppliers of cells for Lucid's products"" (emphasis   added). The cylindrical battery cells LG Chem will produce for   Lucid use a ""proprietary chemistry"" developed jointly by the two   companies.Lucid's statement directly acknowledged the existing   relationship with Samsung SDI:Lucid has recently announced a separate battery cell supply     agreement with Samsung SDI. Although both supply agreements are     intended for Lucid's first vehicle, there are other possible     applications for these cells. These could include batteries     developed for other companies as part of Lucid's powertrain     supply business, or variants of the sedan with specific     performance requirements. The differing performance attributes     available from the two cell suppliers provide Lucid with     maximum flexibility to select the best cell for each     application.Lucid has very high expectations for the cells that are used     in our batteries, and we are fortunate to have two companies     that are willing and able to work with us to meet our     requirements.So, what's going on here?Two deals with two heavyweight rivalsIn one sense, it's not surprising that Lucid would seek a deal   with LG Chem, which is already an established player in the   still-new market for lithium-ion cells for automotive   applications. Most notably, it supplies the cells (and some other   parts) forGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM)Chevrolet Bolt EV, and it has been aggressively building production capacity and   seeking other clients around the world. (The Bolt's cells use a   different proprietary chemistry owned by GM.)Of course, we could make a similar case for Samsung SDI.   Samsung, which has made lithium-ion cells for consumer   applications for years, ramped up its electric-car efforts when   it acquired an automotive battery-pack business fromMagna Internationalin 2015. That was one of several moves it has made over the last   couple of years in an effort to build a sizable business as atop-tier auto-industry supplier. Samsung SDI now supplies batteries forBMW's""i"" vehicles andFiat Chrysler Automobiles' electric Fiat 500e.Simply put, both Korean companies are established heavyweights   jockeying for position as electric vehicles become more   commonplace. Meanwhile, aside from a few hand-built prototypes,   Lucid has yet to build a single car -- but it has managed to get   deals with both to supply batteries for its future products.How did Lucid do that? And why?The answer to the ""how"" may be found in Lucid's history. The   company now known as Lucid Motors was originally called Atieva,   and it was originally founded in 2007 to develop advanced battery   packs for electric vehicles. In its initial incarnation, Ateiva   reportedly did electric-vehicle design and engineering work for   GM,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andAudi, and it also did some work on battery packs for electric buses   in China.Ateiva's direction changed in 2014 after a big fundraising   round intended to jump-start its development of a line of   electric cars (and its name changed in October). But the company   retains deep expertise in batteries and battery packs for   electric cars -- and possibly, as its statement about the LG Chem   deal hints, for other applications as well. That's probably why   both Samsung SDI and LG Chem were willing to make deals.As for why, Lucid hasn't quite spelled it out. But there are   many Tesla veterans on Lucid's team (including CTO Peter   Rawlinson, who was the chief engineer on Tesla's groundbreaking   Model S). The company often seems determined to out-do its larger   electric-car rival -- or at least to make a point of showing that   it has learned from Tesla's mistakes.In this case, it's worth noting that Tesla has a deep   relationship with one primary battery supplier (Panasonic). Lucid may feel that Tesla's dependency on a single battery   supplier exposes it to some risk that could be hedged by having   strong relationships with two big suppliers.More evidence that Lucid is for realThe deal with LG Chem is another sign that Lucid is a serious   effort worth watching closely. Lucid is planning to break ground   on its new factory in Arizona sometime in the second quarter of   2017, and it's hoping to begin shipping its first model (the Air   sedan) by the end of 2018.Those dates may slip. However, my sense is that Lucid and its   car are for real, and it looks like a couple of very big   suppliers agree.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Catalysts for Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Vehicle Deliveries This Quarter;12/21/2016;"As far as deliveries go, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) crushed it last quarter. Deliveries were up 114%   year over year and 72% sequentially. But despite the recent rapid   growth, Tesla's guidance for the final quarter of the year   suggested management only anticipated a modest hike in unit   sales. The company said it expects deliveries to be just over   25,000 units, or only a few hundred units higher than in its   third quarter. Could this guidance be overly conservative?Model X production at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California.   Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();There are three catalysts for continued growth in Tesla's   deliveries that could boost deliveries higher than management   forecast.1. Self-driving hardwareJust one week before Tesla posted its third-quarter results   and shared guidance for its fourth quarter, the company   surprisingly announced it had begunshipping every vehicle with sensors for fully   autonomous driving.While software updates enabling these new vehicles to start   driving themselves could be years away in many of Tesla's   markets, as the company refines the system and waits for   regulatory approval, the significance of this update shouldn't be   overlooked. The new sensor suite includes 360-degree visibility   around the car up to 250 meters, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors   to supplement its cameras, and forward-facing radar. And these   sensors are powered by a new onboard computer with over 40 times   the computing power of the previous-generation processor in Tesla   vehicles.Fortunately, Tesla isn't making buyers wait until the   self-driving update is ready to begin letting customers benefit   from these sensors. Customers who buy these vehicles with the   updated sensor suite can purchase what Tesla calls its ""Enhanced   Autopilot,"" or essentially an improved version of its existing   driver-assist Autopilot system. Tesla plans to begin rolling out   its software updates for its enhanced autopilot as soon as the   company has enough data from updated vehicles on the road to   calibrate the new sensor suite.Throughout the quarter, Tesla has been prominently marketing   the inclusion of self-driving sensors in every vehicle by   highlighting the feature on its homepage and linking to a video   showing the feature in action.2. Model S and X updatesDuring the fourth quarter, Tesla also announced a few notable   upgrades to its Model S and Model X.The Model X (left) and Model S. Image source: The Motley   Fool.For its Model S, Tesla added an option for an all-glass roof.   The new upgrade option no longer includes a center crossbar,   creating a long seamless piece of glass across the top of the   vehicle.And Tesla's new Model X option is perhaps even more notable.   The company finally began offering a seating option with a   foldable second row. The feature helps create 88 cubic feet of   interior cargo space, giving the SUV the greatest interior   storage capacity of its class, according to Tesla. Not having an   option for foldable second-row seats was one of the biggest   complaints about the Model X.These updates were announced in the beginning of November,   leaving enough time for customers to place orders for vehicles   with these new options and still take delivery before the fourth   quarter ends.3. Increasing productionFinally, rising production during Tesla's fourth quarter   should make it easier for the company to deliver more vehicles   than its guidance for ""just over 25,000 units"" calls for. Barring   any unexpected bottlenecks in Tesla's factory, it's likely the   company continued to increase production during the final quarter   of the year.Tesla factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.In Tesla's third-quarter shareholder letter, management   specifically noted it was still ramping up production of its   Model X. While Tesla management has repeatedly emphasized how   difficult it is to predict the SUV's production ramp-up, it has   certainly been very rapid recently. Thanks to rising production   of the vehicle, third-quarter Model X deliveries jumped 89%   sequentially. While Tesla's conservative guidance for total   vehicle deliveries obviously suggests investors shouldn't expect   such a sharp increase in Model X deliveries in Q4, it's unlikely   the continued production ramp-up for Model X won't lead to at   least slightly higher deliveries during the quarter.These three catalysts combined should make it fairly easy for   Tesla to beat its own guidance for vehicle deliveries in the   final quarter of the year. The company has beat its quarterly   guidance for vehicle deliveries in 11 of the past 14 quarters,   but has missed its guidance twice this year. Tesla announces   vehicle deliveries within three days of each quarter's end, so   investors can expect an update on the key metric during the first   three days of January.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s Why Tesla Has A Competitive Edge In The Autonomous Cars Market;12/21/2016;"Several automakers and other companies have been working on autonomous cars, which are being touted as the vehicle of the future. Yet another,  Tesla Motors (TSLA), has established a clear lead. The company has installedautopilot hardwarein every vehicle produced since October 2014. These vehicles have now generated nearly 1.3 billion miles of data, which can be used to improve intelligence for a fully autonomous vehicle. This gives Tesla a huge competitive advantage over other players.  These include Google, whose parent company Alphabet recently spun off the autonomous car business intoa separate company.  Also present are General Motors and Uber, which do not have access to any such large volumes of ""real"" data.  Autonomous autos developed by Google have covered around2 millionreal miles, significantly lower than Tesla's data. We believe that, as consumers start thinking of transport as a service instead of a private vehicle, the self-driving market will grow significantly. The number of private owned cars per capita is declining in cities, where there is often excellent public transportation and millennials do not prefer to own cars. In the long run, self-driving cars could augment or even replace the existing public transport infrastructure and we expect this to be a huge opportunity for automakers. (Read Self Driving Cars, Part 2 : Size Of Opportunity Involved).See our full analysis for Tesla MotorsModel 3 Likely To Have Hardware Enabling Full   Self-DrivingmakeArticleAd();Tesla's much awaited Model 3, which is likely to be on the roads by the end of 2017, will have an improved hardware suite that will enable fully autonomous driving. If this launch date is met with the promised features, Tesla will be the first company to release a fully autonomous car in the market. While other companies might not be far behind in launching similar vehicles, the installation of this hardware will ensure that Tesla can collect more data as this model launches, further improving its autonomous driving intelligence.Model 3 is Tesla's mass market electric vehicle and it received an overwhelming response when bookings were opened earlier this year.  According to our estimates, after its launch in 2017, Model 3's market share will climb significantly reaching nearly 20% by the end of our forecast period.A first mover's advantage in the autonomous cars market comes with a huge advantage of accumulating enormous amounts of data, which is the backbone of artificial intelligence. Tesla already had this advantage and is likely to gain more once Model 3 is launched. With self-driving cars likely to be the future of the automotive industry, Tesla will have an edge over other players in this technology.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock   Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Rallies on HUGE Upside Potential;12/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been a roller coaster experience withTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) since its IPO in late June. Within its first three months as a publicly traded company, TWLO stock rose by over 137%, before getting dealt a huge blow in October. Since then, TWLO has lost roughly 53%.Source:Web Summit Via FlickrAs of Dec. 19, TWLO stock had lost roughly 8.5% in December alone. However, the stock price decline improved to just under a 5% loss by Dec. 21.makeArticleAd();The gain here came after Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White initiated coverage on TWLO stock, tagging it a ""buy"" with a $45 a share price target. That's over 30% upside potential.TWLO Stock Valuation ProblemThe truth is that TWLO stock looks overvalued, going by its financials. That's a big reason it's struggled during its first few months in the market.The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnTWLO currently makes no profit. It recorded a loss of about $35.5 million in 2015. In 2014, Twilio stock grew its top line by roughly 78%. In 2015, top line growth came in at roughly 88%. However, the company expects only 61% revenue growth this year. That's worrying because the company is nowherenearthe point where growth should be slowing down.On top of that, TWLO stock currently sports a price-sales ratio of just under 11. A company with similar growth rate,58.com Inc (ADR)(NYSE:WUBA) has a P/S ratio of four and expects to report 60% revenue increase this year. It gets even worse for TWLO on considering that WUBA is expected to report such revenue growth, having grown its top line from just over $87 million in 2012 to roughly $715 million in 2015.Still, valuation isn't everything for companies in early growth stage. If not,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) would probably never have been a good buy.TSLA sported a P/S ratio of about 25 in 2012. That has improved to just over five as of this writing. The growth potential is usually what matters when looking at early growth companies like TWLO stock.Analyst's Case for TWLO StockMoreover, analyst White believes all isn't lost for TWLO in terms of valuation. In his research noteobtainedbyStreet Insider, he said:""Currently, Twilio trades at an EV/revenue ratio of 6.3x our CY:17 sales forecast and well below the 9-22x EV/ NTM ratios (up to three years after an IPO) of high growth companies (seventeen companies we analyzed) of the past. Given the sharp decline in Twilio's stock since September (down 59%), we believe the market has already discounted the lock-up expiration that begins this week""The translation of this is that, the entirety of Twilio Inc is valued fairly relative to its revenue, compared to other 17 high growth companies that Drexel Hamilton has analyzed. Another version is that, at current levels, the company's revenue should be very attractive to potential acquirers.White also made mention of a first mover advantage in the cloud communications platform market. This market is worth over $45 billion, according to estimates from IDC. Interestingly, based on Drexel Hamilton's 2017 revenue forecast, TWLO stock owns less than a percent of the market. Even at this, it's still the biggest player in the cloud communications industry.TWLO has been taking steps to grab more of this market. In the third quarter, it introduced the Twilio Enterprise Plan, which is designed to offer advanced security and access management for bigger organizations. It has also unveiled Voice Insights, which gives developers deeper analytics of the users of their voice applications.Bottom line on TWLO StockAs stated above, most of the valuation metrics you'd want to look at would tell you that TWLO stock is overvalued.Alibaba (BABA) Stock Has a Thorn in Its Side -     Donald TrumpHowever, it's still an early growth company with a disruptive concept. Innovative companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), UberandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are using Twilio.TWLO is definitely worth a watch especially if you're looking to invest in a disruptive company.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for     2017The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016The postTwilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Rallies on HUGE Upside Potentialappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Business Model Will Succeed in Energy Storage?;12/21/2016;"As the cost of batteries, fuel cells, and renewable energy   more broadly come down, it's becoming clear that energy storage   will be a big business in the future. It can smooth out the   variability inherent with wind and solar, provide valuable   services to the grid, and move cheap renewable energy created   during the day to hours when it's most needed.It's becoming more clear that energy storage will be valuable,   like wind and solar energy a decade ago. What's not yet clear,   though, is the answer as tohowenergy storage will generate value for investors. Creating a   business model that can exploit the advantages of energy storage   to make money will be key. And the industry may be perilous for   those on the bleeding edge.makeArticleAd();Powerwall 2 on the outside of a home. Image source: Tesla.Where energy storage has valueGenerally, we know where energy storage has value. Rocky   Mountain Institute has defined 13 value drivers from energy   storage, including self consumption of solar, backup power, and   energy arbitrage (lowering electricity consumption during high   cost times and moving it to low cost times). These are the itemsTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have used to justify a lot of the limited amount   of energy storage that's been installed today, but those   businesses are essentially in pilot mode.Image source: Rocky Mountain Institute'sThe Economics of Battery Energy Storage.If the chart above is correct, the bigger sources of value may   come from the utility side of the ledger. Transmission congestion   relief and distribution investment deferral are two of the most   valuable uses of energy storage, but they're driven by utility   needs and go through regulators. For developers, you can't just   build a battery and bid it into the open market without   regulators driving the utility to buy services from you.There's value from energy storage for the entire grid, from   utility to customer, that much is clear. The question is, who   pays for this value and how? Here's a few viable options.Value to the home and businessesLooking at energy storage from the customer side, the   justification will be all about cost reductions. For homeowners,   that may be energy arbitrage in states like Hawaii and now   California. Commercial customers can justify energy storage   through reducing demand charges, a fee the utility charges based   on peak demand even if it's only for 15 minutes per month. These   are both ways to lower payments to the utility, which has caused   utilities across the country to change rate structures to stem   the loss of customer electricity demand.A potential way forward would be utilities finding a way to   build rate structures that allow customers to install solar and   energy storage on site, but still incorporate into the grid. This   would keep people tied to the grid and create a win-win   situation. But finding a solution that works for everyone won't   be easy.Utilities see energy storage differentlyTo understand how a utility sees energy storage you have to go   back to a utility's business model. A utility's incentive is to   grow electricity consumption and increase their asset base from   which to charge customers. That means they have incentive to keep   customers from owning energy storage and would rather own storage   assets themselves.The problem for utilities is if they push back too hard   against customers owning energy storage, the more they'll push   companies to develop business models to make energy storage   economical. This could even push residential customers to   eventually leave the grid and commercial customers to find   alternatives to buying electricity from the traditional utility,   something that's already taking place in Nevada. So, utilities   will want to create rate structures that allow them to partner   with renewables, energy storage, and customers. This may be   easier said than done and there's no easy answer to how utilities   should react to energy storage.Powerwall 2. Image source: Tesla.Solar + storage may have a bright futureWhen you look at the dynamics, you can see that there are a   lot of complex incentives clashing in energy storage. But one   area where the technology can bring value is when combined with   intermittent renewable energy. This could take hold in   distributed resources or at the power plant level.One idea being pushed by solar installers is for small energy   storage systems in a home or business, known as a distributed   energy storage asset, be compensated to balance the grid on a   localized level. They could store energy when it's cheap and   allow the grid to draw energy when demand is high. Hundreds or   thousands of distributed assets could be tied together to create   a network of assets with the grid providing a price signal and a   third party -- like Tesla, SunPower, or Sunrun -- reacting to   maximize the value of their distributed assets.On the utility side, we could see solar or wind projects bid   energy projects into the grid but provide attached energy   storage. This could reduce the volatility going to the grid,   reducing the need for spinning reserves, and can ease the effects   ofthe duck curve(a spike in demand in the late afternoon when the sun goes down   and people get home from work). If long duration energy storage   technology improves enough we may even see solar projects save   energy for nighttime. That would truly be a game changer.Who will get energy storage right?You can see that creating a business model to take advantage   of energy storage will be difficult. But there are a few things   we can deduce from the state of the industry and the history of   adjacent technologies like solar panels.The first thing is that battery manufacturers and companies   that don't have a discernible technology advantage won't likely   generate much value for investors. Batteries are a commodity and   have been low margin for decades. That's why nearly every company   -- with the exception of Tesla -- has decided to focus onhowto use the battery and not manufacturing of batteries. The same   goes for other energy storage technologies.Utilities will also have a hard time generating a significant   amount of value from energy storage. In some cases, they may be   able to install storage to offset other investments, but that   will mean a smaller asset base to rate base, which hurts the   business long term. There's just no clear model for utilities in   energy storage outside of getting regulators to allow them to own   distributed battery systems in homes and businesses and, like   rooftop solar, that will be a tough sell.That leaves developers buying commodity energy storage   products and selling services to the grid or customers. This is   where I think the true financial opportunity lies. It could take   the form of residential solar companies up-selling storage and   then controlling its functions to maximize value, making money   through a fee or revenue-sharing model with customers. This may   involve aggregating thousands of energy storage systems and sell   the resources into the grid, something an aggregator could do but   a homeowner or single business couldn't. Or the solution may be   as simple as software to tie a battery to the utility's price   signals and then sharing the revenue with a battery owner.I think the business model to watch will be adding energy   storage to another energy service like solar. Solar + storage   could be a compelling proposition and would be an easier sell   than energy storage as a stand-alone service. But that's my best   estimation of what will happen in the future. And like solar a   decade ago, the companies that can build a viable business model   in energy storage have a big market opportunity ahead of   them.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Things You Should Know About the Solar Sector;12/21/2016;"The solar sector can be an enticing and risky space for   investors. There's tremendous growth in the industry andtrillions of dollars in potential revenue, but companies come and go rapidly as the landscape changes.   Before jumping in, here are three things every investor should   keep in mind.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Understand the importance of external policiesSean Williams: One of the most important things to know about solar stocks is   that external policies can have a big impact on the industry.   Three really good examples are OPEC's policies, the EPA's   policies, and U.S. Solar Investment Tax Credit.Solar panel makers thrive when there's both demand and urgency   for their products. This means when fossil fuel prices are high,   the urgency for consumers and businesses to switch to solar is   there. When crude andnatural   gas pricesfall, solar panel supply can increase and the urgency to make the   transition to a green energy solution decreases. Over the past   two-plus years, we've witnessed solar panel supply increase and   urgency decline as crude and natural gas have hit multi-year   lows. However, with OPEC recently agreeing to cut production and   crude prices surging on the news, it's possible we could see   demand for solar begin creeping back into the industry.Within the U.S., policies from the Environmental Protection   Agency can certainly have an impact on the solar industry.   Tougher carbon emission regulations have encouraged utilities to   switch away from coal-fired electrical generation and toward   alternatives, such as cleaner-burning natural gas and   solar-powered systems. Of course, president-elect Donald Trump's   stance that some EPA regulations and oversight should be pulled   back could work against the solar industry in the near-term.Finally, we have the U.S Solar Investment Tax Credit (SITC),   which allows for a 30% dollar-for-dollar tax credit on the cost   of the panels and installation. In late 2015, the SITC was   extended through 2019, providing an impetus for Americans to   invest in home-solar systems. The SITC will begin throttling down   in 2020 before disappearing completely for consumers by 2023.   These subsidies can be a strong tool that encourage or discourage   solar investment.As a solar industry investor you'll need to keep your eyes on   the policies and subsidies that could impact the valuation of the   companies you own.Solar is a big growth industry, but also very cyclicalJasonHall: Today, solar still generates a very small percentage of total   electricity around the world, meaning there's likely to be huge   growth for decades to come. Factor in an expected   one-billion-person expansion of the power-hungry global middle   class over the next couple of decades, and there's a wonderful   growth market for long-term investors to profit from. One has to   look only at power generation in the United States alone to see   the potential:US Primary Energy Productiondata byYCharts.However, investors must also understand the nature of the   solar industry's likely growth to have the best chance at   profiting. The best way to understand solar panel manufacturing   is that it's a wonderful long-term growth industry, but it will   also be highly cyclical from year to year, with ups-and-downs in   the short-term even as long-term demand increases. This is   particularly true in the utility and commercial/industrial   segments, where the amount spent on large, expensive projects can   shift dramatically up or down from year to year.At the same time, solar panel manufacturing is complex,   expensive, and largely a cost-driven, commodity business. This   makes operating leverage critically important, and any solar   manufacturer that's unable to respond to shifts in demand before   the market shifts can swing from solid profits to steep losses   very quickly.For this reason, investors must understand that:These cycles are inevitable.It can take time for even the best manufacturers to work     through those cycles.It can take time for investments to pan out, requiring     discipline and patience, as well as knowledge of which     manufacturers have strong operations and balance sheet     stability.Solar has a lot of potential, both as an energy source and an   investment. But unless you're willing to put in the work and   understand the industry and find the best companies, it's also an   easy industry to lose a lot of money in.Flexibility is a mustTravis Hoium: Sean is right that policies impact the solar industry's demand   more than most industries. And if we want to go more granular we   could look at how policies in states like Hawaii, Nevada, and   California are impacting the industry on a local level.That's why having a flexible business model is really key to   solar companies. Manufacturers need to be able to move supply to   where it's needed all around the globe, installers need to be   able to ramp up and down depending on demand, and finance   companies need to be flexible in the products they offer.One example of a company handling this well isSunPower Corp(NASDAQ: SPWR) , the high efficiency solar panel manufacturer.   The company sells solar panels into nearly every major solar   market, so when Germany was a big installer it had a presence   there and now that China is growing it has solutions there.   SunPower can also go big or small, providing solutions for   rooftop solar customers and utilities looking for massive power   plants. This doesn't guarantee success, but it allows a   flexibility to change the business as market conditions   necessitate.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) subsidiary SolarCity has been on the opposite end   of the spectrum. The company is almost completely focused in the   U.S. and has tied itself to the lease/power purchase agreement   finance model. When states like Nevada change policy the company   has to lay off workers and shut down operations.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Wins 1, Loses 1;12/20/2016;"Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) reportedly made some important progress on   expanding its executive team recently when it hired Volvo's Head   of Interior Engineering. But Tesla also lost a tenured executive   from the company's energy storage business. The two executive   changes, detailed byElectrekon Monday, highlight pressures at the company as Tesla ramps up   for its critical Model 3 launch next year.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Another hire aimed at boosting qualityIt's no secret Tesla has experienced some quality issues.   While the reliability score for the Model S was recently ranked   as average byConsumer Reports, the same product rating agency said the newer Model X has been   plagued with problems. Going further, Tesla cited Model X quality   issues as one of the reasons for the company's   slower-than-expected production ramp-up earlier this year.Tesla has taken a number of actions to address production   quality, including making important hires to help with production   and quality control. Some of the notable hires that Tesla made   during 2016 which aimed at increasing Tesla's expertise in   manufacturing and production quality includeVolkswagen'sPeter Hochholdinger, who was responsible for production of Audi's A4, A5, and Q5   vehicles, andApple's Director of Reliability Engineering.And now Tesla seems to be making another hire that might help   bolster product quality. Volvo's Head of Interior Engineering,   Anders Bell, will join the electric-car maker ""in an equivalent   role this month,"" said Electrek's Fred Lambert.On Bell's LinkedIn profile, he lists key accomplishments in   his most recent role at Volvo of launching the interiors for the   Volvo XC90, X90, and V90.While it's possible Bell will help improve the interiors of   the Model S and the Model X, it's likely Tesla's upcoming Model   3, which management plans to launch before the end of 2017, will   be Bell's biggest priority when he comes on board.It's time for a breakOn another note, Tesla is simultaneously losing key talent.   The VP of its energy storage business, Mateo Jaramillo, is   leaving the company after working there for seven years.   Jaramillo's reason for leaving? The executive is ready for a   break from the high-pressure Tesla culture, Electrek gathers.Tesla Model X production in the company's car factory. Image   source: The Motley Fool.Both Bell's onboarding and Jaramillo's decision to exit put   the spotlight on changes at Tesla as the company begins preparing   to dramatically increase production. With its sights set on   increasing vehicle production from an annualized run-rate of   100,000 units today to 500,000 units in 2018 on the back of Model   3's higher-volume deliveries, Tesla is in the middle of a major   expansion. In Nevada, Tesla is rapidlybuilding its Gigafactorywhile simultaneously increasing battery production in the   portions of the building that are already up. And in California,   Tesla recently unveiled plans tonearly double the size of its car factory. Meanwhile, production and deliveries of the company's Models S   and X are soaring. In Tesla's most recent quarter, deliveries   were up 114% year over year and 72% sequentially.Investors may want to keep an eye on Tesla's executive comings   and goings. While there have been a few prominent executive   departures at the company during the past year, it has   undoubtedly benefited froma strong inflow of integral talent. Of course, this should be expected in light of Tesla's   ambitious growth plans, but it's still comforting to see that   Tesla is able to attract experienced and accomplished names like   Bell.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Ahead of Model 3, Tesla Motors, Inc. Continues to Revamp Its Supercharger Program;12/19/2016;"One of the key selling points toTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) all-electric vehicles is the company's expansive   Supercharger network. This robust network's 120 kilowatt-powered   charging stations makes long-distance travel feasible in the   U.S., Western Europe, China, Japan, and part of Australia -- and   Tesla continues to add new markets. But the network is set to be   tested when the electric-car maker brings to market its $35,000   Model 3 next year.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Ahead of Model 3's launch, and in anticipation of higher   demand for the charging locations, Tesla is making lots of   changes its Supercharger program.Supercharger idling feesThanks to the Model 3's lower price point compared with   Tesla's Model S and X vehicles, Tesla expects that the Model 3   will help take annual production from a run rate of 100,000 units   today to 500,000 in 2018. With five times as many cars on the   road, Tesla needs to ensure the stations don't become congested   -- a problem Tesla has already been dealing with in markets where   electric vehicles are popular -- namely, California and   Norway.But the automaker announced a solution on Friday it thinks   will increase Supercharger availability and ""make the   Supercharging experience far better for everyone."" To address   Supercharger congestion, completely charged vehicles still   sitting at a Supercharger location will now incur a fee.Tesla explained the move in its blog post:The Tesla app allows owners to remotely monitor their     vehicle, alerting them when their charge is nearly complete and     again once fully charged. For every additional minute a car     remains connected to the Supercharger, it will incur a $0.40     idle fee. If the car is moved within 5 minutes, the fee is     waived. To be clear, this change is purely about increasing     customer happiness and we hope to never make any money from     it.But there is one exception to this fee, Musk said in a   follow-up tweet after the announcement: ""We are going to modify   this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If   the site is basically deserted, no problem to park.""Free forever -- but only for someFor now, every Tesla vehicle purchased gets free lifetime   access to Tesla's Supercharger network when traveling long   distance. But, earlier this year, Teslaannouncedthat it will end this benefit for any orders made after Jan.   1.Tesla detailed the change in a blog post:""For Teslas ordered after January 1, 2017, 400 kWh of free   Supercharging credits (roughly 1,000 miles) will be included   annually so that all owners can continue to enjoy free   Supercharging during travel. Beyond that, there will be a small   fee to Supercharge which will be charged incrementally and cost   less than the price of filling up a comparable gas car.""The change, Tesla said, will allow the company to reinvest   into its network, accelerating its growth to improving the   experience for current and future owners. But Tesla was careful   to emphasize that its Supercharger network ""will never be a   profit center for the company.""An expansionModel 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Of course, fees for idle vehicles at Superchargers and the   network's monetization won't be enough to fully alleviate   problems associated with a rapidly growing number of Teslas on   the road as the Model 3 launches at a higher volume. To this end,   the company is also investing in an aggressive expansion of the   network. At Tesla's Model 3 unveiling in March, the company said   it planned to double its Supercharger stations, or individual   charging stalls (not to be confused with Supercharger locations)   around the world by the end of 2017, increasing them from about   3,600 when the Model 3 was unveiled to 7,200. Today, Tesla has   4,875 Superchargers.Tesla's charging network is integral to its customers'   experience of owning a fully electric car. By offeringmuch faster charging than what's available for   other electric cars, Tesla currently is the only manufacturer to make long-distance   travel in a fully electric car feasible. So it's good to see   Tesla taking steps to prepare the way for the Model 3, which   management plans to begin delivering to customers sometime during   the second half of 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Waymo, and Way More Info on Self-Driving Cars;12/19/2016;"December has been a busy month for self-driving car news. In   this week's episode ofIndustry Focus: Tech, Dylan Lewis and Motley Fool senior tech specialist, Daniel   Sparks, give listeners an update on the state of autonomous car   research and production today.First, a look atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) new offshoot company, Waymo,   which is entirely focusing on self-driving tech -- what we know   about the company so far, how it fits into Alphabet's strategy,   and how long it might take before we start seeing results. The   hosts also look at howApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , Uber,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andGM(NYSE: GM)  are progressing in the race, and how investors   need to look at the space as of today.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7, 2016This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016.Dylan Lewis:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, December 16th, and we're doing a   roundup of self-driving car updates. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,   and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist,   Daniel Sparks. Daniel, how's it going?Daniel Sparks:Good, Dylan, thanks for having me on the show.Lewis:A little blustery over there in Colorado, huh?Sparks:Yeah, high wind warnings this morning. It's pretty crazy. Glad   you can't hear it through the microphone.Lewis:Yeah, it seems like the kind of weather you might want some   driving assistance, huh?Sparks:I guess so. (laughs)Lewis:So, Daniel, there's been a ton of news regarding   self-driving cars in the past month or so. It seems like   pretty much every major player in the space has come out with   an announcement of some sort. It seems like on our end, we   were probably due to do a little check-in and see what's going   on. How's that sound?Sparks:Sounds good.Lewis:The first news that I really noticed -- I mean, there were other   ones that came up in the past couple weeks, but one that really   caught my attention -- was Alphabet's self-driving car project   doesn't seem to be just a project anymore. It seems like they're   emphasizing this within the Alphabet holding structure.Sparks:Yeah, we saw that blog post, Waymo is what they're calling it.   It'll be interesting to see where they're taking this, for   sure.Lewis:In that blog post, they said ""Waymo stands for a new way forward   in mobility. We're a self-driving technology company with a   mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move   around."" The TLDR here, the very simple explanation of what's   going on is, they are taking the self-driving car project under   Google X and turning it into an identifiable business under   Alphabet. This is awesome, I think, if you're an Alphabet   shareholder, because it shows that they're going to put a little   bit more emphasis on moving things along and not having these fun   projects be just that, that there's going to be a   commercialization element to it, and a path to that. But to me,   more than anything else, this highlights the benefits of the   Alphabet holding company structure, and how under CFO Ruth Porat,   they've decided to take a more Wall Street-friendly look at   some of the things that are going on there at Google.Sparks:Yeah, it definitely highlights the Alphabet structure that   they have set up, and the benefits of it. Investors should   realize that this isn't just some new project that they're   doing. This is the graduation of the self-driving   car project to an actual company. This is really one of the   first instances where we've seen this under the Alphabet   structure, where we can see, where they take this from   their Google X area, which is more just moonshots in   development, is kind of how they're making it look, and   we're really seeing that with this particular instance, and   then graduating over to an actual company and, like you   said, putting some pressure on it so they can start turning   it into a business.Lewis:Yeah, and this is, like you said, not something that   happened overnight. The self-driving car project has been in   the works, I believe, for over eight years at this point. My read   on this -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Daniel   -- is, we're not really going to be seeing actual financials   on Waymo broken out when Alphabet gives its quarterly   numbers, at least not anytime soon. It seems like they will   probably continue to be lumped into other   bets reporting for the foreseeable future.Sparks:Yeah, I definitely think they're going to keep it in other   bets, because with Google's revenue at the $22.2 billion and   the other bets revenue at about $200   million, virtually all of the company's profits coming   from the core Google segments, and nearly a $1 billion loss   coming from other bets -- I don't think Alphabet is ready, just   because Waymo is turning into a company, to   start segmenting out this information on its own. Not only   would it probably draw attention to simply a losing segment,   since they haven't really monetized this service yet,   and like we said, that's kind of the purpose of it. And,   also, it could potentially give competitors an edge that   they don't really need to let competitors have, by looking   into their business. This is very small to their business, they   don't have to report it to investors. It's not material at all,   so they might as well keep it under wraps as long as they   can.Lewis:Yeah. So, while we won't have a ton of financial insights, it   seems, what I think this does open the door to is some   questions and maybe a little bit more pointed commentary   from management in some of those quarterly calls and   maybe some of those press releases on specifically   what's going on with the self-driving car project. Again,   probably not something we're going to get a ton of insight into   immediately, but something that in the coming quarters and years,   we should definitely expect to hear more from.Sparks:Definitely.Lewis:One of the other things we got some color on regarding   Google's self-driving car project, I guess I should be   calling it Waymo now, is exactly how they plan to   monetize self-driving car technology. This is something   that's been kind of up in the air for a while. At times,   they've talked about not wanting to be a car   manufacturer, but it's hard to take them at face value   there, because they're looking to obscure this as much as   possible. You want to talk a little bit about what we got in   terms of commentary there?Sparks:Yeah, that was one of the big takeaways when they were   coming out with this Waymo announcement. There was some   speculation that Alphabet could be working on its own   Google-branded car. While they might not actually have   thought of planning of manufacturing it, as they do   with their hardware products, they often outsource   the manufacturing and then slap that brand on, similar   to the way Appledoes with Foxconn, but, there was some speculation that   they could try to be working on some Google-branded car,   and we have seen their cars with no steering wheel,   their ambitious vision of a totally autonomous driving   experience. There has been some speculation in the past that they   would be planning to bring a larger fleet of those to the market.   But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that's how you   pronounce it?Lewis:I think it's pronounced another way, but I'm not sure. I've   only seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I   understand how neither of us are totally sure.Sparks:OK, that sounds better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him   John today. John, he emphasized that they're not trying   to turn into a car business, but rather wanting to focus on   the technology behind the cars, and basically, Waymo's mission to   make driving autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name,   really focus on the mobility. I think this is a good move.   This is something that Alphabet has succeeded at in the past by   really focusing on software and gathering data -- because,   essentially, that's the company's core mission, to organize data.   So, by doing this, I'm actually more bullish on the segment by   seeing that they're really going to focus on their core   competencies with it. And maybe similar to the way Alphabet tries   to add in Google-branded hardware later on with Android,maybe they'll do a similar things with cars by trying to bring in   Google-branded cars later on after they've really developed and   honed in on their expertise and the autonomous area of the   technology.Lewis:Yeah, the quote from John, as we'll refer to him, ""We're in the   business of making better drivers. We're a self-driving car   company, not a car company."" I think, if you look back at   some of the things that have happened in the last month or   so, you see that Apple seems to be taking kind of a similar   route with their autonomous driving ambitions.Sparks:Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the   giant automobile segments, where companies like Alphabet and   Apple don't have any significant revenue, and in theory, it   looks like this awesome opportunity for Alphabet and Apple to   start making these cars. Maybe that's why a lot of the   speculation received so much attention, thinking about a   Google-branded or Apple-branded car is a really powerful   idea, it could open up the companies to huge new revenue   opportunities. But, when you actually get down to think   about it, especially in Alphabet's case, it would really be   out of their core competency to start making cars. Even   Apple, by outsourcing their manufacturing and building   Apple-branded hardware products, along with their software, cars   is just a whole 'nother breed. It's a really capital-intensive   business. By Alphabet doing this, and now, like we're going to   talk about, Apple focusing on the software part of the   business, it really de-risks these new segments, but on the other   hand, may decrease some of the potential upside if things do   go well.Lewis:Yeah, you look at the margin profile for the car   business and the smartphone business, and they   are dramatically different. It would be very tough to   achieve high-30% margins in cars. For as much as I know   about the industrials business, I know that. So, you can   understand why these huge tech companies are instead   choosing to focus on something that's super scalable and can be   easily brought into millions of cars without actually having   to manufacture them themselves.Sparks:Right.Lewis:And if you had any doubts about Apple's interest in making   self-driving cars, I think Tim Cook has been pretty   coy in some public interviews about not really letting in on   a lot of details, being a little cagey, the company sent a letter   to the National Highway Traffic Safety   Administration regarding Federal Automated Vehicle   Policy earlier this month. And it made it pretty   clear they have something cooking there. The NHTSA can   grant exemptions to certain compliance standards if   that organization decides that it's important for research   and investigations. Apple's letter was essentially   urging the administration to expedite the exemption requests   that are coming in from some new entrants, so, some people   that maybe haven't been quite as ambitious as the early entrants   into autonomous driving. That, I think, says all you   need to hear about their interest in this space, and the   fact that it's something that they're obviously putting a   decent number of resources into.Sparks:Yeah, I think that Apple is definitely working on a   car, as far as we can tell. Recent reports suggest that   the company has hundreds of employees working on it. The   transition, initially, it was referred to as Project Titan, and   it initially transitioned away from building a car   -- this is all speculation, keep in mind -- to really   focusing on the technology, similar to Alphabet. The rumor   is, now, it's going to be deeply integrated into iOS, and   the company is looking for a 2017 deadline of proof of concept of   something that can work. So, Alphabet and Apple, these are   still really speculative things. But, at least with   Alphabet, we're starting to see a direction, an actual company,   and an effort to monetize the business, which is encouraging.Lewis:And for both of those companies, these are things that are   exciting. They're very attractive, they're fun to   speculate on because they are nascent tech. But they are not   going to be meaningful to the top line or bottom line for quite   some time. That's something to keep in mind there. Of course,   flipping over to the private side of things, not a public   company, but Uber also made headlines this week, of   course, not to be outdone by some of the larger tech names.   After the company had deployed some self-driving vehicles in   Pittsburgh in September earlier this year, they now have deployed   about five or so autonomous Volvo XC90 SUVs in San   Francisco. The aim there was to have them not only be out on the   roads, but out on the roads picking up customers, right?Sparks:Right. They kind of jumped the gun on this one, and put them   out on the California roads without a permit,   which California requires for auto   manufacturers testing autonomous vehicles. What Uber did was   kind of make an assumption with wordplay. Apparently the   rule was that manufacturers testing autonomous vehicles that   don't require human drivers to get a permit, and to make   sure that someone is there, ready to grab the wheel and take   over. That wordplay was that the vehicle was autonomous,   that's when they would need a permit. So, Uber argued,   ""Well, these cars aren't technically   autonomous, because we have drivers there ready to take over   when something goes wrong."" Of course, in their blog post, they   did say they're deploying ""self-driving"" cars, they used that   wording. So, it's really interesting to see them going this   route with it. It caused a lot of debate as to whether   this is right. It brought Uber back to a problem they had early   and were scaling back on, which was being a rebel when it comes   to regulations. Kind of putting them back in that spot right   now.Lewis:Yeah, that certainly doesn't help their case in trying   to improve their reputation. I know that's something that has   plagued them for quite some time. It'll be interesting to   see how that plays out with regulators in California, and   whether it's something they push forward on. In preparing for the   show, we talked about how there's kind of a huge difference   between how a public company and a private company might   handle something like this, just because the liability on   Alphabet or Apple's side, with doing something without express   written consent from the regulatory body, could   be devastating to them as a business and to shareholders.   And, I'm sure there are a lot of controls in place for   people that have private placements with Uber. But, you can   afford to be a little bit more brash when you don't have   public investors, I guess.Sparks:Right. And it's worth noting that, according   to Bloomberg, the California DMV is saying it's   going to try to pursue legal action on Uber. I don't think   it's clear yet that Uber has stopped. But there was an   interesting scenario when, on the first day of this program,   one of the Volvos with the self-driving hardware ran a red   light when a pedestrian was trying to cross the sidewalk.   Uber said in an update that it wasn't actually in self-driving   mode when this happened. They emphasized, ""So, this is why we   need to be pushing so hard for a self-driving future to help with   safety."" Kind of a funny instance.Lewis:Maybe more wordplay there, too, it seems. (laughs) And, last   but not least, I know that you wanted to touch on Tesla,   and how they are going about self-driving a little bit   differently, just because they are not, by nature, a   platform company, they are a manufacturer first, and that   gives them some advantages when it comes to integrating   their solutions, and maybe on the data side, as well.Sparks:Yeah. So, you have companies like Tesla, GM, in some ways,   who are trying to work on the self-driving   software, but also on the manufacturing. You look at Uber,   when they're solely focused on the software for now, for   self-driving, it does present some challenges, as far as   testing these autonomous vehicles and getting them ready for the   public roads works, because a company like Uber can't really give   its sensors away to manufacturers. They would actually have to   sell those sensors. And that's where the challenge is. How are   they going to get these sensors over to all   these manufacturers, and how are they going to get all this   data about how these sensors are operating on the   roads, unless they're actually getting the sensors into the   cars? So, then you have companies like Tesla, who   are already delivering vehicles with the self-driving   sensors in them, they could run these sensors in shadow mode   while people are driving in their normal daily routes, even   while they're holding the wheel, and they could collect   information and really start getting the data, because they're   also a manufacturer. Of course, they're still making money   on their sensors, because they're selling the car itself.Then, you have General Motors, similarly, they are a   manufacturer, but they're also working, at least in part,   with Lyft. And they've made some of their   own acquisitions on developing a self-driving software. So,   they can sell their cars, make money on their cars, and   have a revenue stream with a business model already as they're   putting these sensors in vehicles, and start collecting data. Of   course, they are not to the point yet where they are already   delivering cars with self-driving hardware like Tesla is, but I   imagine that they could do that in the future as well, and run it   in shadow mode. That's just an interesting point.Lewis:Yeah. There are a lot of things that are unclear about the   self-driving car market. The one thing that is clear is   that there are a bunch of different companies with a lot of   money at their disposal trying to crack that nut a   couple of different ways.Sparks:Right, yeah. It's a really uncertain space right now. I   think that's the biggest takeaway from this. It's exciting, it's   interesting, but these are all small portions of businesses. Even   at a company like Tesla, there are no cars actually driving   themselves on the road right now. All of these, investors   should put it into perspective, I think.Lewis:Yeah.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Institutes ‘Supercharger Idle Fee’;12/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) doesn't want customer hogging its superchargers.Source: ©iStock.com/ChenRobertTo stop customers from leaving their cars parked at supercharging stations, Tesla Motors Inc is introducing a supercharger idle fee. This fee will charge customers 40 cents for each minute they leave their cars at the stations once charging is complete.makeArticleAd();The supercharger idle fee isn't designed to make Tesla Motors Inc any money. Instead, the company claims that it just wants to make sure that the superchargers are available to those that really need them. Ablog postfrom TSLA compared leaving a charged car at a supercharging station to sitting at a gas pump once fueling is complete.Tesla Motors Inc is hoping to help customers avoid the supercharging idle fee in a couple of ways. The first involves its app. The app will notify customers when their car is almost charged, and again once it is fully charged. The second way is waiving fees for customers that move their vehicles away from the stations within 5 minutes of reaching full charge.Tesla Motors Inc also says it hopes to avoid this process completely in the future. The company has an interest in creating vehicles that can someday drive themselves away from the supercharging stations once they have a full charge.Tesla Motors Inc announced last month that it plans tobring an end to free supercharging. This change will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017. It will only apply to customers that buy their cars after this date. However, these customers will still get 400 kWh of free supercharging credits each year.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 201710 Dangerous High-Yield Dividend Stocks to     Avoid5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Institutes 'Supercharger Idle Fee'appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Riding a Bumpy Road to Profits;12/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you strip out theSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY) acquisition,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) appears to be headed in the right direction. Tesla's last quarterly report ended a nasty losing streak in the earnings confessional, with the company besting expectations by more than 200%. What's more deliveries are up, and Tesla appears to be on track.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Via FlickrBut the SolarCity deal scuttled any vestige of bullish sentiment TSLA stock may have gained from its strong fundamental performance, leaving the bears in firm control.Now Tesla has a chance to reverse the situation, at least somewhat, when it releases its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report at the end of January.TSLA Stock by the NumbersBy the numbers, Wall Street expects Tesla to report a fourth-quarter loss of 8 cents per share - a vast improvement over the company's loss of 87 cents per share in the same quarter last year. What's more, revenue is expected to rise 30.6% to $2.28 billion.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017That said, sentiment is waning fast on TSLA stock. Fourth-quarter earnings targets have been revised sharply lower during the past two months, dropping from expectations for a profit of 49 cents per share during this time frame. Concerns range from Tesla hitting its deliveries target to the impact of the SolarCity acquisition, which will remain a major thorn in the company's side until the deal shows some positive impact.Taking a closer look at the brokerage community's expectations, Thomson/First Call report that only four of the 20 analysts following Tesla stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. What's more, the 12-month consensus price-target of $233.33 represents a modest premium of about 15% to yesterday's close.Elsewhere, short sellers continue to pile into bearish TSLA stock positions. As of the most recent reporting period, the number of Tesla shares sold short rose by 13% to 35.7 million. This wealth of shorted stock now accounts for nearly 30% of TSLA's total float, or shares available for public trading.Even options traders are jumping on the bearish TSLA stock bandwagon. Currently, the January 2017 put/call open interest ratio comes in at 1.83, with puts nearly doubling calls among near-term options. This ratio dips slightly to 1.19 for the weekly Jan. 27 series - i.e., those options most affected by Tesla's quarterly report, which is expected to arrive around Jan. 25 - giving some indication that short sellers are taking light precautions against a potential rally.Overall, January implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 7.3% for TSLA stock. This places the upper bound at $217.25, while the lower bound lies at $187.75.2 Trades for TSLA StockCall Spread:The negativity behind the SolarCity deal has to wane at some point, and a positive earnings report next month could go a long way toward mending the sentiment picture for TSLA stock. Furthermore, with so many naysayers on the sidelines, there is a wealth of potential buying fuel available to send the shares higher.Traders looking to take a contrarian stance on Tesla stock ahead of earnings might want to consider a weekly Jan 27 series $205/$210 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $2.25, or $225 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $206.94, while a maximum profit of $2.75, or $275 per pair of contracts, is possible if Tesla stock closes at or above $210 when weekly Jan. 27 series options expire.When Will Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Sap Investors' Patience?Put Sell:If selling premium is more your thing, then a weekly Jan. 27 series $170 put sell may be what you are looking for. At last check, this option was bid at $1.88, or $188 per contract.On the upside, you keep the premium received as long as Tesla stock closes above $170 when weekly Jan. 27 series options expire. On the downside, should TSLA trade below $170 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $170 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for 2017The 10 Best Vanguard Funds for 2017The postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Riding a Bumpy Road to Profitsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM-Free Report),Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F-Free Report),Tesla Motors, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),PACCAR Inc.(NASDAQ:PCAR-Free Report) andCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Should Automakers Fear a Trump Presidency?The U.S. auto industry has been experiencing a bull run for the last few years. Sales in 2016 are likely to be 17.5 million autos, in line with the figure recorded in the previous year. The trend is likely to continue into 2017, before dropping to the 16 million range.However, political events and market instability could lead to an early decline. President-elect Donald Trump's policies on imports and economic relations with other countries are expected to impact the industry significantly.One China PolicyThe U.S. auto industry may face challenges in the world's second largest economy due to political reasons. Trump's out-of-protocol decision to acknowledge communication from the President of Taiwan goes against the ""One China Policy"". This may hurt the U.S.-China trade relations. Trump asserted that the U.S. is not bound by the policy that categorizes Taiwan under ""one China"". This is likely to impact the friendly relations that have lasted for decades.While China is not expected to create any military pressure on the U.S., recently the nation's official newspaper China Daily revealed a state planning official's claim that the country will soon fine a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior and price fixing. However, no particular company has been named by the official. While the article stated that nothing improper should be read into the matter, shares of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM-Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F-Free Report) were hit by the announcement. However, no official statement regarding the matter has been released by the government so far.Moreover, the U.S. and China may face other trade problems if Trump puts tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese imports, as per his previous announcements. Shares of Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) and PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ:PCAR-Free Report) also fell roughly 0.6% and 0.5% to close at $197.58 and $65.37, respectively, on Dec 15.Production ProblemsDuring his campaign, Trump had claimed to prevent outsourcing of manufacturing from the U.S. A number of domestic automakers plan to move the production of smaller cars to Mexico for cheap labor. They claim the production of small cars is not profitable in the U.S., unlike the SUVs which are sold for a higher price. The production can easily be shifted under The North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") but if Trump decides to call off the agreement, it may cause problems for automakers. His final policy on the increase of taxes on cars produced in Mexico and changes to NAFTA are expected to impact the auto industry significantly.Trump stated that he will not let car makers shift production facilities from the U.S. to Mexico as this will lead to a transfer of available jobs from U.S. to Mexico. Automakers, however, find it unprofitable to continue production of small cars in the country. Meanwhile, U.S. producers such as Ford and General Motors along with heavy equipment makers like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT-Free Report) and many of their suppliers have invested billions of dollars assuming the continuation of relatively open trade of U.S. with Mexico, China and other countries.Auto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnWhere Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

3 Unbelievably Undervalued Dividend Stocks;12/18/2016;"TheS&P 500is currently trading near an all-time high, which is making it   quite difficult to find companies that are trading on the cheap.   However, if you're willing to turn over a lot of rocks, you'll   find that there are still a handful of stocks out there that   are trading for dirt-cheap prices.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Brookfield Property Partners(NYSE: BPY) ,Ford(NYSE: F) , andGamestop(NYSE: GME) are three such stocks, and better yet, they all offer   up huge dividend yields. Let's take a closer look at all three to   determine if they could be worth buying.A global real estate empireBrookfield Property Partners makes its money by buying real   estate assets such as office buildings, retail stores, and   multifamily properties, and it then leases out space in those   properties under long-term contracts. This business model   provides the company with a steady base of cash flow that   management uses to pay out an ever-rising distribution.Image source: Brookfield Property Partners.Brookfield's assets are currently worth $31 per unit, which is   up about 3% over the year-ago period. That's a solid growth rate   when you consider that the company took a hit on currency   fluctuations, and it also paid out $1.12 in annual distributions.   With shares currently trading under $22 per share, I think   Brookfield Property Partners is meaningfully undervalued.Thankfully, I'm not the only one who agrees. Management has   been buying back its units hand over fist, retiring more   than 2.8 million units in the last 15 months alone. With   shares trading at such a discount to their asset value, I think   that's a great use of capital.An auto giantInvestors haven't been showing large automakers like Ford   any love recently, and it's not hard to understand why. Auto   sales have been on fire in the lucrative North American market,   which is causing traders to worry that sales and profitsare peaking. If true, that could suggest that sales and profit margins are   currently unsustainably high, which means future profits growth   could stagnate, or even decline in the years ahead.If that wasn't enough to worry about, there's also the very   possibility that autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing   service could put a dent in auto sales over the long term. Mix in   the fact thatTesla Motorshas been rapidlytaking market share, and it's not hard to understand why traders are approaching the   company's stock with caution.Image source: Getty Images.All of those worries have weighed heavily on Ford's stock,   which is why the company is currently trading at less than six   times trailing earnings. When you combine that value price tag   with the company's rising dividend payments, Ford's dividend   yield has been above 4.5%.Despite all the doom and gloom, Ford does offer reasons   investors to be optimistic. The company is investing heavily to   mass produce a self-driving car for use in ride-hailing and   ride-sharing by 2021, which Ford believes could driveincreased profitabilityin the years ahead. In the meantime, Ford stock is so cheap,   investors could win by buying shares today.A business in transitionWith trailing and forward P/E ratios below seven, it   isn't much of a stretch to say that investors have written off   video-game retailer GameStop as ""dead money."" It's not hard to   understand the narrative that surrounds the company,   either. Comparable-store sales aredeclining, which is pulling down revenue and earnings per share. With   gamers continuing to shift their attention away   from physical products and toward digital offerings, it   isn't hard to paint this company's future as bleak.Image source: GameStop.However, GameStop's management team is certainly aware of   these industry dynamics, and they're investing accordingly.   GameStop is beefing up its digital and mobile offerings and   bundling them with physical game purchases. That helped drive a   54% jump in its tech brand sales division last quarter. The   company is also making a big push into the collectibles space   through its Think Geek brand, where revenue is growing rapidly.   Better still, these new areas are higher margin than its legacy   gaming business, so gross margins are actually on the   rise.Of course, it will still be some time before the company's   growth initiatives will fully offset the revenue   declines from its physical games business, which is why the   market isn't giving GameStop any credit. However, analysts do   believe these moves will pay off in the long term as   current estimates call for EPSgrowthof more than 7% over the next five years. That's a strong growth   rate for such an absurdly cheap stock. Add in a   dividend yield of 5.8%, and it's possible long-term investors   could do well by buying shares today.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

It’s Energy Storage's Time to Shine;12/18/2016;"Power storage has been a major topic of discussion within   energy industry circles, particularly in connection with   renewable energy, as technological advances appear poised to   bring with them a new level of innovation. Affordable storage   would allow for more renewable power sources on the grid, create   a path for customers to leave the grid, and even allow for new   innovations around dynamic loads in energy.The inconvenient truth is that until recently, energy storage   didn't have any financial justification. Theideaof value was there, but there was no actual value to create.   Rooftop solar power systems create energy and can offset demand   from other sources. The best energy storage systems can do is   move demand from one hour of the day to another, but doing that   was so expensive, it didn't make financial sense.What's changed recently is that utilities are starting to put   rate structures in place that will make energy storage more   economically viable. Ironically, their moves -- designed to   reduce the appeal of solar -- are providing the impetus for   innovation in the energy storage industry.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Where storage is hitting the grid todayThe initial uses of energy storage systems have been primarily   in commercial buildings and utility applications. A commercial   building can use storage to reduce demand charges -- fees based   on the peak consumption in a building every month. And utilities   are running pilot programs and even using stored power to patch   holes in the grid, as Southern California Edison did earlier this   year when it couldn't provide enough peak power to customers   after the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) swooped in and quickly built an 80 MWh energy   storage system to fill the gap.These are important applications, but they're also just the   tip of the iceberg. As costs fall and technology improves, we'll   see energy storage play a bigger role across the country.GTM Research estimates that 260 MW of energy storage will be   built in the U.S. in 2016, but that figure will jump to 478 MW in   2017 and 2,045 MW by 2021.Image source:GTM Research.Developers are just starting to scratch the surface of energy   storage's potential.What the future of storage looks likeThe economics of energy storage start to make sense as the   price of batteries come down. And that's when we'll see greater   adoption.In residential solar, customers will be able to use storage   systems to consume more of the energy generated directly from   their rooftop systems, rather than selling it back to utilities.   This was the intention of Tesla's Powerwall, and withSan Diego Gas & ElectricandPacific Gas & Electric-- two of the largest utilities in California -- transitioning   from traditional net metering to the time of use rates in Net   Metering 2.0, there will be more value to be extracted from good   storage systems.Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are also bringing their own storage solutions to   homeowners, so look for the adoption of residential energy   storage to grow tremendously in 2017.Commercial energy storage will continue to be driven by   demand-charge reductions, but we could see more energy storage   systems installed for self-consumption as well.The segment to watch in 2017 is really utility scale storage.   We will likely see large batteries distributed throughout the   grid, capable of relieving pressure on the grid locally. I also   expect energy storage will begin being included in renewable   energy bids in the future. The large concentration of solar in   California has already led to a power consumption pattern that   has been dubbedthe duck curve: Demand on the grid drops off during day, followed by a large   increase as the sun goes down (taking solar out of the equation)   and most people get home from work. Energy storage systems built   in conjunction with renewable energy plants can help make the   duck curve less dramatic for the grid.Energy storage may start turning a new leafThe energy storage industry is in a similar position to where   solar was in 2010. The economics are starting to justify it for   some applications, and costs are rapidly coming down, opening new   opportunities in the market. That in turn will lead to new   innovations and product offerings. In short, 2017 may finally be   energy storage's time to shine.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft: Trump's Trade War Could End Badly;12/18/2016;"ByBlue Harbinger:Despite bygones, tech leaders and president elect Trump struck a friendly chord at this past Wednesday's Tech Summit held at the Trump Tower in New York. However, gleaning potential policies from the topics discussed (and Trump's campaign rhetoric) could spell trouble for several of the Tech Summit attendees, Microsoft (MSFT) in particular.This article provides a brief review of Microsoft's evolving business, several valuation metrics worth considering, and an overview of the potential impacts (positive and negative) of new policies that may come out of the Trump Administration such as those that would artificially create more US tech jobs, lower corporate tax rates, pressure interest rates higher, allow overseas cash repatriation, and utilize punitive tariffs with international trading partners.OverviewmakeArticleAd();Microsoft's business consists of three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (consists of Office and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (consists of public, private and hybrid server products and cloud services, includes Azure), and More Personal Computing (consists of Windows, devices, gaming, search advertising, Bing and eventually LinkedIn). And for reference, the following charts show the revenue and operating margin breakdown and growth trajectory of each segment.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearnings slides)More Personal Computing is the biggest in terms of revenues, but has lower margins and is therefore the laggard in terms of operating income. And with regards to revenue growth, More Personal Computing (-1%) is also the laggard versus the other segments (+8% and +10%) on a year-over-year basis as shown in the following table.(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearnings slides)With regards to Cloud, Microsoft seems to be the number two player (behind Amazon Web Services) in an extremely competitive space. Notwithstanding any mistakes, Cloud should provide Microsoft continued growth. Additionally, Microsoft's Productivity and Business Process Application provide some strong advantages and barriers to entry versus peers, as does the Windows operating system.For more perspective, the following graph shows how Microsoft's Windows for PCs is becoming a smaller part of Microsoft's revenue, and server products and tools are accelerating.And from a bottom line standpoint, Microsoft's net income remains healthy as revenues remain strong, as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)Additionally, Microsoft has provided a positive outlook whereby revenue in two of its three segments is expected to grow (Productivity and Business Processes plus Intelligent Cloud, but not More Personal Computing).(click to enlarge)Valuation MetricsFrom a price-to-earnings standpoint, Microsoft remains reasonably priced as shown in the following chart (taking the tech bubble era with a grain of salt).(click to enlarge)Additionally, a basic discounted free cash flow model suggests Microsoft has some price appreciation potential. Specifically, if we discount Microsoft's 2016Free Cash Flowof $25 billion, by its 11.85% weighted averagecostof capital and assume a 9.1% 5-year annual growth rate (this is the average estimate of the 8 professionalanalystssurveyed on Yahoo Finance), and a conservative 3-5% growth rate thereafter, then Microsoft is worth $465.0B to $580.4B after adjusting for outstanding long-term debt (-$60.2B) and cash and short-term investments (+$136.9B). On a per share basis, this amounts to a valuation between $59.76 and $74.61, which gives Microsoft current share price roughly 8% upside versus the midpoint of the range.Worth noting, Microsoft pays a healthy dividend. The dividend yield currently sits at around 2.4% (as shown in the following chart) which is above average for Microsoft and above average for an S&P 500 company, particularly one in the technology sector.(click to enlarge)A higher than average dividend yield from a blue chip company like Microsoft can be a signal from management that they believe their stock price should be higher (which would mathematically bring the dividend yield closer to the historical norm, ceteris paribus). Worth noting, Microsoft's dividend payments are well covered as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)In essence, Microsoft is a stable company with an above average dividend and the potential for more growth and share price appreciation.New Administration PoliciesIt is worth considering the potential policy changes (and their impact on Microsoft) that might come out of the Trump Administration following this past week's ""Tech Summit"" (attended by Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracle (ORCL) CEO Safra Catz, and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, to name a few).Specifically, we consider policies that may artificially create more US tech jobs, lower corporate tax rates, pressure interest rates higher, allow overseas cash repatriation, and utilize punitive tariffs.1. More US JobsFor starters, one of Trump's biggest themes is US jobs creation. However, the types of jobs he's talking about (middle class manufacturing jobs) aren't going to help Microsoft, and his views on highly skilled international workers may actually harm Microsoft significantly. For example, Trump has been critical of H1B visas, claiming they take jobs away from Americans. In our view, H1B jobs help Microsoft attract the talent it needs to remain successful. Forexample…""Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H1B visas,   which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign   workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it   difficult to hire employees for the company, stating ""I'd   certainly get rid of the H1B cap."" Critics of H1B visas argue   that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment   for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower   salaries.""Additionally, Trump may attempt to force more manufacturing jobs into the US, rather than allowing US companies to trade more freely with international partners (for example, Trump wants to see Apple's iPhone manufactured in the US, despite daunting economical headwinds). Generally speaking, international trade can increase productivity and efficiency by allowing each partner to focus on what they're best at, and then allowing trade so each partner can obtain what it needs. Policies restricting international trade could particularly impact Microsoft considering ""as of June 30, 2016, Microsoft employed approximately 114,000 people on a full-time basis, 63,000 in the U.S. and 51,000 internationally; and also according to Microsoft ""Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue…"") (2016 Microsoft Annual Report). Overall, Trump may be able to create some new US jobs with his pro-growth agenda, but if he restricts free trade and H1B visas he could significantly hurt Microsoft in particular.2. Lowering Corporate Tax RatesWith regards to lowering corporate tax rates (another one of Trump's consistent themes), this is a no-brainer (in a good way) for US business, but it may help Microsoft less than some of its peers given its already relatively low effective tax rate as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)The theory is that by lowering taxes on corporations, it will make them more competitive internationally. It will also, in theory, prevent companies from relocating to other countries with lower tax rates and taking away US jobs when they relocate. However, as the above chart shows, Microsoft already has a lower effective tax rate than many of its peers. Lower corporate tax rates could help Microsoft on the margin, but competitively less so than its peers. Arguably, Trump could spur the overall economy by lowering tax rates across all market sectors which would eventually trickle down to Microsoft, but in the immediate term a lower corporate tax policy is likely to help Microsoft less than other companies.3. Raising Interest RatesThe Fed sets interest rates, not the President, but Trump's aggressive growth agenda could speed up the economy resulting in the Fed acting sooner to raise rates faster and this could actually help Microsoft given its large cash balance that currently earns very low interest (i.e. higher interest rates mean Microsoft could earn a higher rate of return on its cash). And granted, much of the $137 billion in cash on Microsoft's balance sheet is overseas, but in theory the US can lead interest rates around the world higher if it's successfully able to accelerate growth.4. Repatriating Non-US CashAs the following chart shows, Microsoft has a very large amount of foreign cash. And given the currently high tax rates to repatriate this cash, companies aren't doing it.If the Trump Administration were to orchestrate a tax deal whereby companies could pay less tax, then they'd likely be willing to bring that cash back to the US. This would be a ""win-win"" in the sense that the lower tax rate would allow companies to bring the cash back to the US and create more US growth and US profits, while still allowing the government to collect some revenue from the lower taxation rate on the repatriation. This is a potential Trump policy that actually makes sense and could benefit Microsoft.5. International TradeDonald Trump has expressed a combative attitude towards international trading partners. For example, he is not happy with China, and according to hiswebsite, he wants to:""...label China a currency manipulator.""""…bring trade cases against China, both in this country and   at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the   terms of its entrance to the WTO.""""Use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes   if China does not stop its illegal activities, including its   theft of American trade secrets - including the application of   tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of   1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.""However, if Trump starts a trade war with China, China has the ability (and a track record) to inflict pain on US companies. For example, during the early 2000s, China openly allowed pirated copies of Microsoft Windows to be sold in most big cities for only around $1 (clearly this was not good for Microsoft). And it would be easy for China to allow similar cases going forward if Trump takes any aggressive actions. As another example, China is already flooding US markets with too much steel and aluminum which is keeping prices artificially low and hurting US producers. As yet another example, China has a reputation for manipulating its currency thereby making its exports very inexpensive.If Trump starts a trade war with China (he did threaten a 45% tariff during his campaign), or any other country for that matter, it could end badly for all US companies, especially those with significant non-US business, such as Microsoft (e.g. Microsoft has 51,000 international employees, and international operations provide a significant portion of Microsoft's total revenue).ConclusionThings could end badly for a lot of tech companies, especially Microsoft, if the new administration follows through on some of its aggressive policy ideas, particularly with regards to international trade. However, despite the policy-related risks, we've still ranked Microsoft #7 on our list of top7 Tech Stocks Worth Consideringbecause we suspect cooler minds will prevail, thereby making Microsoft attractive because of its strong evolving business, above average dividend yield, and relatively attractive valuation.See alsoThe Market Simply Can't Go Much Higheron seekingalpha.com"

1 Major Problem With General Motors' New All-Electric Bolt;12/16/2016;"Appleco-founder Steve Wozniak has long been known as an early adopter   willing to give new products a shot early in their lifecycles.   Unsurprisingly, he has been a vocal owner of aTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S -- perhaps the geekiest car on the planet.   And in September, Wozniak said onFacebookhe would be switching toGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt when it came out.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.makeArticleAd();General Motors was certainly happy about Woz's decision. In a   November press conference at the LA Auto Show about the Bolt, the   company highlighted Wozniak's decision to switch to a Bolt,   showing a slide saying, ""Apple co-founder ditching   Tesla."" Woz's decision to buy the Bolt signaled just how   compelling the Bolt was, even to early adopters.But now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak has changed his mind,   instead buying an additional Model S.What happened? Woz is concerned about the feasibility of the   vehicle on road trips, he said on Facebook this week.While Wozniak's story represents the opinion of only one   person, it highlights a major problem with the new Bolt: Its   maximum charging rate is too slow.Woz bolts on the Bolt... for now""I'm concerned about how it would work on our favored road   trips,"" Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. ""So far, Tesla's   the only game in town for that.""Wozniak was likely referring to how much longer it will take   to charge a Bolt. The 50-kilowatt charge the Bolt can handle is   well below the 20 kW of power that a Model S can handle. To   be fair, Wozniak is still considering the Bolt, he said on   Facebook. ""It had a lot of things nicer about it than the Tesla,""   he noted. But General Motors might have to improve the Bolt's   charging speed first.Tesla Superchargers span major highways in the U.S. Western   Europe, and China. Image source: The Motley Fool.The Bolt's website details the Bolt's charge rate: ""Bolt EV   offers DC Fast Charging capability, which provides up to 90 miles   of range in about 30 minutes of charge time."" Going further,   General Motors boldly asserts that, ""By the time you finish a cup   of coffee, you'll be powered up and so will your Bolt EV."" But   this description doesn't truly capture what the charging   experience will be like for Bolt owners.With over 200 miles of range, Bolt owners will likely charge   at home for their daily driving. So the most likely situation in   which Bolt owners would need to stop to charge would be when they   are traveling long distances. And on road trips, Bolt owners will   likely want to charge more than 90 miles, so they should probably   plan for a long dinner instead of a coffee -- a full charge will   take about two hours.Will this impact demand?It's possible Wozniak would have never considered the Bolt in   the first place if he had been aware of how slowly the Bolt would   charge. As Electrekpoints out, GM hadn't actually confirmed the Bolt's maximum charging rate   at the time. Given that the Bolt uses a 60 kilowatt-hour battery   -- a battery capacity Tesla has used in its vehicles before --   buyers would assume the Bolt could handle a charging rate as   powerful as a Model S can. But according to General Motors'   website, the Bolt charge ismuchslower than a Tesla vehicle. For comparison, a Model S's 120 kW   charge can deliver about 170 miles of range in around 30   minutes.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.Sure, the Bolt's $37,500 price tag is much lower than the   Model S's $68,000 starting price, helping justify its much slower   charging rate. But there's no reason Tesla's $35,000 Model 3,   which the electric-car maker plans to begin delivering by the end   of next year, won't be able to match the Model S's charging   rate.As Bolt customers recognize this flaw with General Motors'   newest technology, Woz might not be the only Chevrolet customer   bolting.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Automakers Fear a Trump Presidency?;12/16/2016;"The U.S. auto industry has been experiencing a bull run for the last few years. Sales in 2016 are likely to be 17.5 million autos, in line with the figure recorded in the previous year. The trend is likely to continue into 2017, before dropping to the 16 million range.However, political events and market instability could lead to an early decline. President-elect Donald Trump's policies on imports and economic relations with other countries are expected to impact the industry significantly.One China PolicyThe U.S. auto industry may face challenges in the world's second largest economy due to political reasons. Trump's out-of-protocol decision to acknowledge communication from the President of Taiwan goes against the ""One China Policy"". This may hurt the U.S.-China trade relations. Trump asserted that the U.S. is not bound by the policy that categorizes Taiwan under ""one China"". This is likely to impact the friendly relations that have lasted for decades.While China is not expected to create any military pressure on the U.S., recently the nation's official newspaper China Daily revealed a state planning official's claim that the country will soon fine a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior and price fixing. However, no particular company has been named by the official. While the article stated that nothing improper should be read into the matter, shares of General Motors CompanyGMand Ford Motor CompanyFwere hit by the announcement. However, no official statement regarding the matter has been released by the government so far.Moreover, the U.S. and China may face other trade problems if Trump puts tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese imports, as per his previous announcements. Shares of Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAand PACCAR IncPCARalso fell roughly 0.6% and 0.5% to close at $197.58 and $65.37, respectively, on Dec 15.Production ProblemsDuring his campaign, Trump had claimed to prevent outsourcing of manufacturing from the U.S. A number of domestic automakers plan to move the production of smaller cars to Mexico for cheap labor. They claim the production of small cars is not profitable in the U.S., unlike the SUVs which are sold for a higher price. The production can easily be shifted under The North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") but if Trump decides to call off the agreement, it may cause problems for automakers. His final policy on the increase of taxes on cars produced in Mexico and changes to NAFTA are expected to impact the auto industry significantly.Trump stated that he will not let car makers shift production facilities from the U.S. to Mexico as this will lead to a transfer of available jobs from U.S. to Mexico. Automakers, however, find it unprofitable to continue production of small cars in the country. Meanwhile, U.S. producers such as Ford and General Motors along with heavy equipment makers like Caterpillar Inc.CATand many of their suppliers have invested billions of dollars assuming the continuation of relatively open trade of U.S. with Mexico, China and other countries.Auto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnAuto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnWhere Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

You Got It Wrong. Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Leads the Self-Driving Space.;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoogle's driverless car project has finally graduated fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) research lab to become a stand-alone company calledWaymo. But while Google expects Waymo to become a revenue source soon, it's been attacked for seemingly falling behind in the self-driving car race.Source:Travis Wise via FlickrWaymo CEO John Krafcik, who by the way is an auto-industry veteran, made it clear that Waymo isn't a car company.makeArticleAd();He said Alphabet's self-driving car business is into making better drivers. TheWall Street Journalparaphrased Krafcik assaying, ""[Krafcik] saw opportunities in ride sharing, transportation logistics and trucking, as well as licensing technology to other auto makers.""There were no definite statements on how the company intends to generate revenue, either. What is clear is that GOOGL is unlikely to make its own self-driving cars and investors should appreciate Alphabet's approach. Here's why.Google Leads the Self-Driving Car RaceIn recent months, Google's beencriticized for slacking offin the self-driving car race. However, its self-driving cars have not logged over 2 million miles over the past eight years for nothing.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017OnlyTesla Motors Inc's(NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot program haslogged more hours(100 million miles as of May 2016.) That's because there are around 70,000 autopilot-enabled Tesla cars on the road.Critics have pointing to moves by traditional automakers likeGeneral Motors Company's(NYSE:GM) acquisition ofCruise Automation, and Tesla's Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. Areportfrom earlier this year on howToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) had the highest number of patents related to self-driving cars also helped them buttress their points.After all, Toyota had over a thousand patents as of when the report was published, while GOOGL only had a few hundred patents. However, what's not being said is that the patents Alphabet holds are mostly related to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies.For instance, GOOGL received apatentthat could prevent autonomous car collision victims from being dragged under the car earlier this year.Considering that Google was a pioneer and it doesn't have the most patents, it seems the company has always known the route it would take, which wouldn't be making cars. Obviously, other automakers will need these V2V and V2I technologies to make self-driving cars work well with the surrounding.The idea goes, ""Allow them to make the self-driving cars, they'll pay us to help connect their cars to the surrounding."" Sidewalk and Nest are likely a big part of Waymo because of what they stand for.GOOGL Stock Is Well-PositionedAlphabet's decision not to make its own cars is a good one, and GOOGL stock holders should applaud it. Traditional auto-manufacturing is already highly capital intensive. A futuristic auto manufacturing business is probably going to be even more capital intensive. The huge capital outlay that building its own car will require might not be worth it, as this is an unproven market.Moreover, as Tesla is showing, it's not easy to break even in the car-making business. So making its own cars wouldn't have been the best route to profitability. However, the opportunities that Krafcik outlined are relatively less capital intensive. The translation is that it will be much easier for GOOGL to own a profitable self-driving business going this route.Stay Far, Far Away From Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)     Stock in 2017Looking at it from the perspective of risk-taking, I believe Alphabet knows what it is doing. As stated above, this market is unproven. Therefore, by licensing its technologies, going into car sharing, etc., GOOGL stock is shielded from the worst-case scenario of self-driving cars failing.But even if self-driving cars fail, its technologies can still be monetized because the auto industry will keep evolving technologically. For investors looking to take a relatively safe bet on self-driving cars, GOOGL stock presents one of your best options.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 BlackRock ETFs to Buy for Steady Retirement     IncomeThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017The postYou Got It Wrong.

Is Ford Motor Company (F) Stock a Good Value?;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'll tell you right off the bat. The answer to whetherFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is a good value is … well, maybe.Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)I know that's not the answer you want to hear. But there are a lot of factors to take into consideration when evaluating Ford stock, whether it be individually or relative to its peers. So it just won't be a simple answer.makeArticleAd();In my opinion,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) stock is thebettervaluewhen head-to-head with Ford. Of course, up againstTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), F stock suddenly becomes extremely cheap at 0.33 times sales versus 5.75 times for Elon Musk's wonderful business.And that's why ultimately, despite many metrics to determine it, value is subjective, not objective. You'll never truly know a stock's intrinsic value, which is what people like Warren Buffett use to determine a stock's margin of safety.Ford's Position Says a LotBut what youcando is examine Ford's position within its three key markets of Europe, China and the U.S. compared to its peers.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017Asking two questions about each of these markets, I'll know how Ford's business stacks up against the others. If it does well on these questions, the notion of good value takes care of itself.Is it growing in each of these markets, and if so, by how   much?Who is growing faster and why?Ford - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 78,7922.1%967,675 3.6% China 124,11317.0%1.1M 10.7% U.S. 197,5745.2%2.4M 0.04%So, Ford is growing sales in each of these markets, although its year-to-date numbers in the U.S. leave a lot to be desired. Otherwise, I think Ford is doing a very good job in its three main markets.GM - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 74,695-1.1%923,759 5.6% China 371,7407.0%3.4M 8.5% U.S. 197,6097.9%2.2M 1.6%Fiat Chrysler - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 75,26510.1%918,634 14.2% China N/M N/M N/M N/M U.S. 160,827-14.3%2.0M 1.0%On the second question of who's growing more and why; that becomes a bit of a tricky issue.As much as possible, I've tried to report the retail vehicle sales of each of the Big Three in these three main markets. However, each of the car companies has a particular way of reporting, or not reporting, a particular month's unit sales and those year-to-date.I challenge you to come up with a figure forFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) in China. Its annual report says it sold139,000vehicles in the country for the entire 2015, down 18.7% from 2014. What it has done in 2016, I really couldn't say.That's really too bad, because FCAU is taking Ford and GM to the mat when it comes to their competition in Europe. And they're not doing horribly in the U.S. where they've always been a distant third in the Motor City.At a price-to-sales ratio of 0.1 and Sergio Marchionne at the helm, I do like FCAU as a potential deep value play.If you look at the China and U.S. markets as one, Ford and GM are basically doing about the same in terms of growth with Ford winning in China and GM in the U.S.Is Ford Stock Good Value?As I said earlier, if I had to pick one of the two on a relative value basis, I'd go with GM. However, I'd say Ford is good value relative to its own historical valuation metrics.Sell Your Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock at a Decent     Price ... While You CanThe problem for me is that I'm skeptical of all car companies as investments. They require way too much capital for the profits they generate and the risks they present.In the case of Ford, it's committed to making lots of small cars inMexico- it wants to move Ford Focus production from Michigan - because consumers don't like to pay too much for smaller cars. If Trump decides to carry out his hate-on for Mexico, Ford's going to get caught in the tariff crossfire.But hey, if you want to own stock in a car company, you could do worse than Ford.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBest Stocks for 2017: Citigroup Inc (C) Stock     Is UndervaluedThe 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The postIs Ford Motor Company (F) Stock a Good Value?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Elon Musk's Inclusion in Trump's Tech Summit Matters;12/16/2016;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President-elect   Donald Trump don't exactly see eye to eye. The two clash strongly   in one particular area: global warming. Trump has openly   disagreed with global warming and Musk has embarked on an   ambitious vision to help put an end to it. The election of Trump   to president, therefore, has prompted some uncertainty   surrounding how the presidency will impact Tesla, which aims to   accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by   building and selling electric cars, energy storage, and solar   products.Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();But Musk may have been encouraged recently when he was invited   to President-elect Donald Trump's Tech Summit in New York City at   Trump Tower.Musk goes to Trump TowerThe invitations for Trump's Tech Summit went out earlier this   month to executives of major tech companies. Beyond Musk,   attendees of the event this week included prominent names likeApple's Tim Cook,Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos,Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, andIntel's Brian Krzanich. With less than a dozen tech leaders attending,   invitations were scant, limited only to the tech elite.""I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to   come to this meeting,"" said Trump in his opening remarks.Based on the sentiment expressed by Trump in the short portion   of the meeting made public, the future President said he wanted   to help things go smoothly for the companies represented.I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ...     we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation.     There's nobody like you in the world. ... And, anything we can     do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you.     You'll call my people. You'll call me, it doesn't make any     difference. We have no formal chain of command around here.     We're going to do fair trade deals, we're going to make it a     lot easier for you to trade.As Electrekpointed out, Musk's inclusion in the tech summit meeting is particularly   notable considering the visionary entrepreneur is the only one   leading a company with a market capitalization below $150   billion. Tesla is currently valued at about $32 billion, and   Musk's privately held SpaceX's recent funding valued the company   at about $15 billion. So Musk is arguably lucky to be able to   represent his companies.And Musk apparently received some special attention. Notably,   Trump's transition team's communication director Jason Miller   said Apple's Cook and Musk were going to stick around after the   tech summit event for a private meeting with Trump, according to   AppleInsider.Musk has also been honored with a spot on Trump's Strategic   and Policy forum. A press release about the forum says it   includes ""some of America's most highly respected and successful   business leaders"" who ""will be called upon to meet with the   President frequently to share their specific experience and   knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda."" Musk,   as well as Uber's Travis Kalanick andPepsi's Indra Nooyi were added to the forum a few weeks after the   Trump administration announced 16 other names, including   influential business leaders likeJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon andWalt Disney's Bob Iger.What Musk and Trump have in commonIf the only remarks from Musk during the meeting at Trump   Tower were any indication of the foot the CEO plans to put   forward with the president, Musk seems like he wants to emphasize   Tesla's vision for manufacturing job growth in the U.S. -- an   area Trump has said he will focus on.Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley   Fool.""Building rockets and cars and solar stuff in the U.S. --   actually really excited about expanding our manufacturing   footprint in the U.S.,"" Musk said when he introduced himself at   the meeting.Tesla alone has created about 30,000 jobs, most of which are   in the U.S. and are manufacturing related. And Tesla also   recently announced an expansion to its car factory in Fremont,   California, and said it plans toadd another 3,000 jobs there. Going further, the company plans to eventually employ about   9,000 people at its under-construction battery factory in Nevada   and 1,000 people at its solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York.   Further, Tesla has inspired auto, defense, and solar companies   all over the world to step up their games.With Trump clearly willing to give Musk his ear, and   considering Musk's important role in U.S. manufacturing job   creation, Musk's companies are off to a good start with the   president-elect.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Also the company actively participated in   high-profile discussions on policy issues such as cyber-security   and the spread of violent online propaganda.

He leveraged his sizable following on the   platform to circumvent traditional media to speak directly to the   public and to bash his opponents.During the meetings held to address technology concerns under   the Obama administration, Twitter was a regular participant   and an important one, considering its rampant use by terrorist   groups such as the Islamic State.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Therefore, Twitter's omission from the meeting is very   surprising.Why Twitter wasReallyOmittedTwitter rejected an advertising deal with Trump's campaign in   October.Fortune, citing a source familiar with Trump's relationship with   Twitter, said the company had to bear the brunt of it in the form   of CEO Jack Dorsey not being invited for the meeting.In the fall, the micro-blogging company received a proposal   from the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC)   to spend $5 million on campaign advertising.

2 Risks Qualcomm Will Face After Acquiring NXP Semiconductors;12/16/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) seems to have opened the door to automotive riches   with its pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . NXPcurrently holds14.5% share in the automotive semiconductor market, which is   expected to be worth $36 billion by 2019, and Qualcomm is buying   the lead in this fast-growing market with its pending $47 billion   purchase of NXP.However, Qualcomm's NXP acquisition does not ensure that the   former will become the dominant player in the automotive   semiconductor business, as it will face a stiff challenge fromInfineon Technologies(NASDAQOTH: IFNNY) . Additionally, Qualcomm might face   integration and margin challenges once the merger is   complete.makeArticleAd();Why Infineon could pose a strong challengeInfineon Technologies is the second-largest supplier of chips   to the automotive industry with an estimated market share of   10.4% to NXP's 14.5%. This means that Infineon does not lag NXP   by a huge margin. What's more, in 2015, Infineon led NXP in two   of the three subsegments in the automotive semiconductor   market.Image source: Infineon Technologies.Infineon led NXP in the market for power and sensor chips in   the automotive industry last year. These two markets were worth   $11.3 billion. In comparison, NXP led Infineon by a huge margin   in the microcontroller segment, which was alone worth $6.5   billion.In the long run, Infineon can close the gap on NXP as it is   the leading supplier of drivetrain solutions to electric   vehicles. Infineon supplied its drivetrain solutions to seven of   the top 10 electric vehicles in terms of sales last year. It   counts the likes ofTesla Motors,BMW, Chevrolet,Volkswagen, and BYD Tang as its customers. This puts Infineon in a strong   position in this market as it projects that sales of electric   vehicles will grow from just 400,000 units in 2015 to 10 million   units in 2025.Along with pending growth in the number of electric vehicles   -- which accounted for less than 1% of market share in 2015 --   the amount of semiconductor content is also expected to grow.   Infineon forecasts that the semiconductor bill of materials in an   EV will be as much as $705 per vehicle by 2025. In comparison,   the chip content in each vehicle last year was $332, according to   NXP.EVs will carry higher chip content as compared to   internal-combustion-engine-based vehicles becausethe electric drivetrain used in EVs contains a lot of electronics   for power switching. The electronic systems in a hybrid   drivetrain route power from the battery to the motor through an   inverter, while no such electronic systems are needed in an   internal-combustion engine.According to McKinsey, the average hybrid drivetrain contains   10 times the semiconductor content as compared to an   internal-combustion drivetrain. As a result, the demand for   insulated-gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, will continue   increasing as they play an important role in EV power   systems.Infineon enjoys a strong position in the IGBT market with a   market share of 27.6%. In 2015, the IGBT market was worth $3.94   billion, according to Infineon, and some estimates put it at $6   billion in revenue by 2018.So, Infineon could bridge the market share gap over NXP in the   long run on the back of EV growth.Integration challengesQualcomm's acquisition of NXP will have a negative margin   impact on the former. This is because Qualcomm's gross margin   profile is higher than that of NXP. For example, in the recently   reported third quarter, NXP posted a non-GAAP gross margin of   50.5%. In comparison, Qualcomm's gross profit margin in the third   quarter stood at 58% .Thus, as Qualcomm begins to integrate NXP after the merger is   complete in 2017, the gross margin might start deteriorating. The   higher gross margin profile of Qualcomm is a result of its   fabless manufacturing model as it outsources its chip   manufacturing to foundries such asSamsung.On the other hand, NXP has a foundry-based business model. It   has 14 chip manufacturing facilities, along with seven packaging   and testing facilities. However, these facilities can't   manufacture chips for Qualcomm as they are ""outdated,"" according   toMarket Realist. This reduces one potential synergy from the acquisition.Despite this hiccup, the NXP acquisition is expected to   deliver $500 million in annual cost synergies for Qualcomm within   two years after the closure of the transaction. However, 65% of   the savings will be on the operating expense side as Qualcomm   will be able to use NXP's existing relationships to sell its   automotive and Internet of Things products.Qualcomm will also reduce its cost of goods sold as the   combined companies can negotiate for lower raw material prices   from suppliers. The reduction in the cost of goods sold will   account for 35% of the cost-saving synergy from the acquisition.   The reason the cost of goods sold synergies will be significantly   lower than the operating expense reduction is because Qualcomm   will not make much gains on the manufacturing side of the   business due to the difference in the foundry business.Also, given the legacy nature of the foundries, it is likely   that NXP won't be getting Qualcomm's money to upgrade them. This   is because Qualcomm has a different business model of outsourcing   its manufacturing, and investing in NXP's foundries would lead to   an increase in costs.Although NXP will definitely add another dimension to   Qualcomm's business, we've seen that it will also have a negative   gross margin impact and pose integration issues. Additionally,   the threat from Infineon cannot be ignored.So even though Qualcomm is making a smart move by acquiring   NXP Semiconductors, it is not guaranteed a smooth journey toward   automotive riches.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is on My Buy Radar;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsShares ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), while still lower by close to 18% year-to-date, have shown   good absolute and relative strength over the past week and a   half. Although still not out of the woods just yet, TSLA stock is   increasingly coiling up for a potentially better move to the   upside.Earlier this week, I met with a few client investors. Among other   things, we discussed the importance of exercising patience in   trading and investing. Tesla stock was one of the example stocks   I discussed because although TSLA is beginning to look more   technically sound for a next leg higher, it has been a painful   equity for impatient traders expecting explosive moves (in either   direction).makeArticleAd();One of the best lessons I ever received from a former trading   mentor was that sometimes there are simply no   high-probability trades to be had in any given stock or index,   for an extended period of time. Patience is a virtue both in life   and in trading. The best traders I have met throughout my career   have an uncanny ability to simply sit on their hands until the   best probability trade flashes. Specifically, they let the   stock price come to them (i.e., to their price levels of interest   where they see a good risk/reward equation).They don't chase, and that would be my advice on TSLA   stock.TSLA Stock ChartsWith that in mind, on Tesla's multiyear weekly chart, note   that since early 2014, shares have largely been stuck in a   sideways (albeit sometimes volatile) trading range. TSLA has seen   some over- and under-shooting of this range here and there.But in the bigger picture, the stock is stuck in a wide   trading range where dips were to be bought and rallies to be   sold.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Over the past month or so, TSLA stock has once again found   support at the lower end of the trading range, which currently   also coincides with the red 200-week simple moving average. From   a momentum perspective, we see at the bottom of the chart that   the blue Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is slowly   starting to turn higher as well.Click to EnlargeWhile this all looks more promising, it's no cigar just yer. I   still need to see a better and stronger bullish reversal off the   horizontal support area around $185.When I last discussed Tesla stock onNov. 28, I highlighted the very early stages of selling exhaustion   and said that less risk-averse active investors could consider   taking initial long positions in the stock against the $180 area   as a stop-loss.So far, this support area is holding, and TSLA shares   have seen a new rally with a marginal high against the late   November highs.On the daily chart, we see that over the past couple of   trading days, Tesla Motors attempted to break past diagonal   resistance from the April highs. While the MACD oscillator at the   bottom of the chart is also slowly curling higher, shares still   are trading below their blue 100-day SMA.Click to EnlargeAs a general rule, better odds of trading stocks from the long   side occur when a stock is trading above both its yellow 50-day   and the blue 100-day SMAs, and those moving averages are   sloping higher. So far, both moving averages are still   sloping lower.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Great Short       Right NowThat said, the less conservative trader could still consider   playing TSLA stock from the long side at these levels, using the   $215 area as a next upside target over the next few weeks.Any strong bearish reversal from here should act as a   stop-loss signal.Like what you see?

Why Electric-Car Fans Should Watch Lucid Motors Closely;12/15/2016;"Electric-car start-up Lucid Motors unveiled its first product   in a media event in California on Wednesday. Lucid's Air is a   sleek high-performance sedan that will have specifications and   pricing calibrated to compete directly withTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .This is significant, and investors interested in electric and   self-driving cars should sit up and take note. The Lucid Air is   no flight of designer fancy. It's a serious product, and Lucid is   a serious company that stands an excellent chance of succeeding.   Read on.makeArticleAd();The Lucid Air is an electric luxury sports sedan that promises   long range, thrilling performance, and advanced self-driving   capabilities. Image source: Lucid Motors.About the carThe Lucid Air is a big luxury sedan that promises to combine   extreme high performance with a roomy, comfortable, and quiet   interior equipped with a lot of advanced technology.Like the top Tesla models, the Lucid Air should be very fast,   at least in a straight line. It might be even faster: Lucid   claims ""best-in-class energy density"" for the Air's 100   kilowatt-hour battery pack, which it says will give the Air ""in   excess"" of 300 miles of range.Once the Air is in production, a 130 kWh battery pack will be   available as an optional upgrade. That will offer ""up to"" 400   miles of range and ""up to"" 1,000 horsepower. Both figures are a   step ahead of what Tesla's current top-performing models can   deliver right now.Image source: Lucid Motors.Lucid's battery packs will use a new lithium-ion battery cell   developed by the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) that promises ""breakthrough battery life,""   according to Lucid's chief technology officer, Peter   Rawlinson.The Air's motor and transmission unit was developed entirely   in-house, Lucid said. It claims that it's ""smaller, more   efficient and more power-dense than competitors, while   potentially more reliable."" (The word ""potentially"" is doing a   lot of work in that sentence. But as we'll see, Lucid's engineers   are not new to the car business.)Inside, Lucid promises ""executive seating"" with cushy,   reclining rear seats that offer comfort and legroom comparable to   first-class airline seats. A 29-speaker audio system will provide   active noise cancellation to ensure that it's a quiet space.As you'd expect from a Silicon Valley automaker, self-driving   technology will be built in. Lucid will aim to have the Air   equipped with ""Level 4"" self-driving capability at launch,   pending approval by U.S. regulators. ""Level 4"" systems can take   full control of the vehicle under most (but not all) conditions,   with little to no involvement from the human driver.The Lucid Air's back seat is scaled for adult comfort. Image   source: Lucid Motors.Lucid hasn't finalized pricing for the Air. But it said that a   fully loaded ""launch edition"" will be priced around $160,000,   with standard versions starting around $85,000. Lucid hopes to   get the starting price down to around $65,000 in time.If all goes according to plan, production of the Air will   begin in late 2018. But some big things have to happen in order   for that plan to pan out.Is this vaporware, or is it for real?It's for real. This is not vaporware. It could turn out to be   a big deal. But there are some caveats that come with that   statement.For starters, Lucid is a real company, founded in 2007. It has   about 330 employees, many with past experience at Tesla or at   large global automakers. Its chief designer, Derek Jenkins, was   formerly the director of design atMazdaNorth America. And Peter Rawlinson, the chief technology   officer, came to Lucid with one of the greatest electric-car   resume credentials possible: He was chief engineer on the Tesla   Model S.In some ways, the Lucid Air can be thought of as the Model S   2.0. It's averyserious, advanced design that reads in many ways as a redesigned   Model S informed by experience. And it's clearly very close to   production-ready. It's not a show car.The shape of the Air's roof allows plenty of rear-seat   headroom. Image source: Lucid Motors.But that's where the caveats come in: Right now, Lucid doesn't   have a factory in which to build the Air or anything else.It has a site for a factory, in Casa Grande, Arizona, selected   for its proximity to key auto-industry suppliers in Mexico. It   has a package of subsidies promised by the Arizona state   government, and a detailed plan to start constructing the $700   million facility in the second quarter of 2017.But it will need to raise money to make the factory a fully   functional operation. Lucid has said that future fundraising   rounds are planned, but it hasn't yet given specifics.So should we take Lucid Motors seriously?I think we should. Lucid seems to be positioning itself as a   sober-minded (""lucid"") alternative to Tesla, in part by making a   point of being entirely focused on electric automobiles. It   doesn't have a whiz-bang CEO like Elon Musk -- but Lucid (which   employs a lot of Tesla veterans, remember) might argue that   Musk's outsized public image and futuristic visions take   attention away from Tesla's products in the here and now.If anything, Lucid seems quietly determined to learn from (and   not repeat) Tesla's missteps. It won't rush the Air into   production nor let itself get distracted by far-future visions.   That ""lucid"" attitude, the car itself, and the serious cash   already invested in the company make it worth close attention as   its plan unfolds.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Shrugs Off a Q4 Earnings Beat;12/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) said on Thursday that it registered 22% year-over-year growth in revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter. After digesting the number for a few minutes, the stock … well, people still weren't sure what to do with ADBE stock.Source:Marcin Wichary via FlickrAn initial negative reaction immediately after the bell might have represented confusion over GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, or it might have been a reaction to conservative estimates for 2017 growth from the company.makeArticleAd();Many analyst estimates use non-GAAP earnings, and estimates were for86 cents per shareon that front. The non-GAAP number came in at 90 cents, but the reported GAAP number was just 80 cents per share. What looked like a miss on expectations turned out to be a beat. Adobe has now beaten earnings estimates for 12 consecutive quarters.Net income for the quarter came in at $399.613 million, onrevenue of $1.608 billion.While Adobe pays no dividend, the company bought back 3.2 million shares during the quarter for $331 million, supporting the price of ADBE stock.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017Still, as after-hours trading went on, some investors saw the beat as a reason to split. The company's strong performance over the past few years has pushed the price-to-earnings ratio to 53. A few of those who enjoyed the ride decided to take profits.Adobe Stock: A Bargain Measured in MinutesThe initial negative reaction in ADBE shares caused analysts to call the numbers a good opportunity to buy the stock, which is up 15% over the last year and 275% over the last five years.As I wrote in previewing the numbers, Adobe is getting a payoff from its past investments in cloud computing, selling more of its graphics and marketing software via subscription instead of through physical media.All segments of the company showed growth. About two-thirds of revenue comes from digital media tools, and 30% from marketing, with just 3% now coming from the fading print and publishing segment that made Adobe famous in the 1980s.The Cloud, The Cloud, The CloudCloud creates a virtuous circle for software companies. Revenues come in regularly through subscription, past use of the software almost guarantees renewals, and costs for maintaining files on cloud goes down over time.Adobe entered the cloud era with a big lead in creative software, and has used its advantages to grow in marketing software.

3 Growth Stocks You Should Avoid in 2017;12/15/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.There's no sugar-coating it: Growth stocks have been the   shining stars over value stocks since the Great Recession ended.   Although aBank of America/Merrill Lynch study found that value stocks have outperformed   growth stocks over the past 90 years with an average annual gain   of 17% versus 12.6%, the low-interest-rate environment over the   past eight years has allowed growth stocks access to cheap and   bountiful capital to rapidly grow their business.But just because low interest rates favor growth stocks, it   doesn't mean you can throw a dart and land a winner. Some growth   stocks are better off avoided in 2017. Here are three such growth   stocks that I'd suggest keeping you distance from next year.makeArticleAd();Tesla MotorsOne high-profile growth stock that I'd strongly suggest   investors leave parked on the sidelines in 2017 is electric   vehicle manufacturerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .This isn't to say Tesla isn't without its positives. Tesla   obliterated Wall Street's earnings estimates in its third-quarter   report, it wound up paying off about $600 million in debt, and   its Model S sedan continues to gain market share. Perhaps most   importantly, Tesla's production levels were a record of 25,185   vehicles, a 92% year-over-year increase and a 37% improvement   from the sequential second quarter. Yet, in spite of an expected   quadrupling in sales between 2015 and 2019, I'd advocate keeping   your distance from Tesla because of three major risks.Tesla Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.The first risk involves increasing competition. Just a few   years ago, Tesla's Model S was the clear leader in mileage range   and luxury. However, other automakers have made a commitment to   bringing more efficient EVs to market. We're seeing improved   mileage ranges between charges, as well as more power and luxury   withBMW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz offering new concepts that could   reach the market before the end of the decade. While Tesla's   market share dominance is likely to continue in the near term, it   could begin to be chipped away beyond 2017.Secondly, I'd be concerned about Tesla's ramp-up in spending   which is likely to keep it as a cash-flow negative company for   years to come. No one said building a Gigafactory was going to   cheap, or that expanding its annual production from 100,000   vehicles to 500,000 vehicles was going to go off without a hitch.   But Tesla has also racked up more than $3 billion in debt, even   after paying off $600 million. Its debt-to-equity of 118% further   confirms the weight on the company's shoulders.Lastly, the valuation remains something out of a horror film.   Tesla commands a $34 billion market cap despite only producing   about 100,000 vehicles a year and losing money. Conversely, a   company likeGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) produced 9.8 million vehicles in 2015 and made an   adjusted profit of more than $5 per share. Personally, Tesla   looks like a no-brainer growth stock to avoid in 2017.BioMarin PharmaceuticalAnother growth stock that I don't believe has what it takes to   excel in 2017 is rare-disease drug developerBioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN) .On the surface, BioMarin has a lot to like for longer-term   investors. Its focus on rare-disease drugs means it'll face   minimal competition and that it'll probably have excellent   pricing power if its therapies are approved by the Food and Drug   Administration. BioMarin already has five rare-disease drugs   approved by at least one major regulatory agency around the   world, and all of its therapies focus on ultra-rare diseases.   Between 2015 and 2019, Wall Street is forecasting that BioMarin's   sales will essentially double from a reported $890 million to   approximately $1.8 billion.Image source: Getty Images.However, there are also two drawbacks to BioMarin. To begin   with, incoming president Donald Trump in his latest interview   withTimesuggested that he would lower drug prices in the United States,   which is a point he previously stated on the campaign trail.   Trump's only policy mention related to drug prices, thus far, was   outlined in his seven-point healthcare reform. Within his   proposal, Trump opines that consumers should be able to look   overseas for their medicines, since similar drugs in overseas   markets are typically priced lower than the U.S. It's unclear if   Trump's call for lower drug prices will have any traction in   Congress, but rare disease drugmakers like BioMarin that have   drugs exceeding the $300,000 annual cost barrier are clearly on   Trump's radar.An even more immediate issue could be BioMarin's ongoing   losses. To some extent the company's steep full-year losses can   be forgiven since it's reinvesting back into its pipeline. Then   again, waiting until 2019 to see a full-year profit doesn't seem   worthwhile for a company with a $14 billion market cap when you   can go out and open a position in a number of rare-disease   drugmakers that are already healthfully profitable, such asAlexion PharmaceuticalsorShire.There appear to be far better options in biotech in 2017 than   BioMarin Pharmaceutical.FitbitFinally, investors would probably be wise to step away from   fashionable growth storyFitbit(NYSE: FIT) as we head into 2017.Like the growth stocks above, Fitbit does have positives that   can be taken away. For example, Fitbit announced in its   third-quarter earnings report that new products accounted for an   amazing 79% of its quarterly revenue. Furthermore, total revenue   increased 23% year over year, 60% of its customers were new, and   20% of its customers reactivated after being inactive for 90 or   more days. This would imply strong new traffic to the brand.Image source: Fitbit.But I'll also admit that I was wrong advocating that Fitbitcould be poised for a reboundback in October. Despite heavily reinvesting in its new products,   the launches of those product, and marketing, all Fitbit got out   of it was significantly lower margins and a reduced profit   forecast. There's no denying that revenue rose 23% in Q3 2016   from Q3 2015, but just 11% of that was an increase in units sold.   The remainder was comprised of price increases on its products.   This would suggest that interest in Fitbit's products could be   ebbing, even with a lot of extra money being spent on innovation   and marketing. The company's lowered fourth-quarter guidance   could imply a year-over-year decline in units sold, with a higher   average selling price of those units leading to growth.Fitbit will also need to overcome the stigma of wearable   technology that it's nothing more than a fad. In other words, can   Fitbit get customers to continually upgrade their device in the   same fashion that consumers upgrade their smartphones every year   or two? Based on the data released during the third quarter, it   doesn't look as if Fitbit's products are resonating enough with   existing customers yet. That could change, but I wouldn't look   for 2017 to be the year we see this ramp up in upgrades.Though Fitbit is on track to see its sales climb by more than   50% between 2015 and 2019, I'd suggest keeping your distance from   this growth stock in 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Will Win Big With Waymo;12/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Waymo becomes part of theAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) family of companies, most analysts are asking when or whether it will contribute to GOOG stock's bottom line.Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)The launch event on Dec. 13 featured a blind man given a ride around Austin, Texas ina car without a steering wheel,and vague discussion of how the project's 2 million miles of self-driving experience could be put to work in ride sharing, trucking or public transport.makeArticleAd();While previous GOOG projects like Nest, the automated home company, and Google Fiber, the phone company competitor, quickly floundered as their teams tried to change the world, the car company Waymo seems interested in getting paid for helping others change the world.It's an important distinction. Google X, the unit into which CFO Ruth Porat put CEO Larry Page's ""moonshots"" in technology unrelated to the search engine, is now expected to turn into a real company or go away.A Real Market for GOOGThe new Waymo is being run by a car guy, former Hyundai USA President John Krafcik, leaving the experimental team under Chris Urmson by the side of the road. Urmson islaunching his own startup.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Krafcikis building a team of experienced auto executives, and representing the company in the press, dealing with the fallout from aTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) driver dying with the car in a self-driving mode, the opening of a Waymo design office in Detroit and initial questions of government regulation.These are practical questions previous Alphabet launches tended to ignore. They also tended to ignore whether the opportunity before them was real or in their heads.In the case of Waymo, it's clear there is a real market. Boston Consulting Group estimates it at $42 billion in software and services within 10 years, others say$560 billion in sales within 20.This has attracted real competition, not just from Tesla but from Uber,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM),Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) and start-ups likenuTonomy.The question for Krafcik is not whether Waymo can knock off these other companies, but where Waymo's experience, software and hardware packages can fit into their plans.Deliberately UndefinedKrafcik is leaving that deliberately undefined. The company has soldFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) on a package that will make100 of its minivansself-driving members of the Waymo fleet.But there are other assets Krafcik can capitalize on, and technical hurdles to be overcome along the way. The lidar ""bucket"" on top of current Google cars costs too much, for instance. The problems of scaling the solution are real ones. Getting the public, politicians and the insurance industry to accept self-driving as a concept is going to be a huge job for the company.Waymo needs to bring in enough cash from what it has already done to fund research into these more specialized areas.Does Apple Inc. (AAPL) REALLY Have an Apple     Watch Problem?For now, Krafcik plans to make Waymo an enabling technology, leaving the heavy capital lifting to others, and making his own efforts self-sustaining.The Bottom Line on GOOG StockThis modest approach will free corporate assets to keep investing in software, in cloud data centers, and in device hardware, which is where CFO Ruth Porat wants the company to be.It should also satisfy shareholders. If Waymo can break even going forward, it will leave GOOG stock's 29.3 price-to-earnings multiple and $554 billion in market cap alone.Since Porat became CFO for what is now Alphabet in June, 2015, GOOG stock is up 49%, the bottom line growing 20% while the top line has grown 10%; it has kept its operating margins at about 25%, and the company will announce revenues of well over $80 billion for the year when it reports 2016 on Jan. 26.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Future is Getting Brighter For Clean Energy;12/15/2016;"According to a new report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy   Industries Association, the third quarter of 2016 was a record   quarter for the U.S. solar industry. 4.14 GW of solar was   installed, nearly as much as all of the solar installed in 2013   (4.76 GW). For all of 2016, the researchers predict 14.1 GW of   solar will be installed, enough to power 2.3 million homes.This is an interesting finding considering the challenges   solar stocks have faced this year.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) have all seen their stocks plunge for a variety of   reasons. And it's those details within the report that are worth   examining.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The biggest solar segment by a long shot77% of all solar installed in the U.S. last quarter was   utility scale, which has helped First Solar and SunPower as two   of the country's largest installers. But we knew late 2016 was   going to be good as developers completed projects contracted to   go online by the end of the year.Image source: GTM Research and Solar Energy Industries   AssociationQ4 2016 Solar Market Insight.An interesting takeaway from the report is that 2017 is   shaping up to be a little better than expected. Corporate   customers are buying energy from solar projects, and a policy   known as PURPA that allows clean energy projects to be built if   they're lower cost than the avoided cost of fossil fuels is   driving adoption.The low cost of utility solar is starting to take hold, and   over the next few years it's the cost advantage that will drive   greater adoption. For now, it's good news that 2016's record year   may not be followed by a completely terrible 2017.Commercial solar is becoming a strengthOne major bright spot was commercial solar, which was up 15%   sequentially and 37% from a year ago. This report includes   community solar in the commercial, or non-residential, segment,   so that helped the growth figures.What's worth pointing out is that commercial customers are   finding solar attractive to purchase and developers are figuring   out ways to finance projects. That's a new trend in 2016, and as   costs come down and financing becomes available we could see a   boom in commercial projects in the same way we saw in residential   solar from 2010 to 2015.Residential solar is having a tough timeSpeaking of residential solar, it's becoming harder and harder   to sell incremental rooftop solar systems, a challenge that led   to a shrinking market in the third quarter. Installations were   down 10% sequentially and 2% from a year ago.There were strengths in new markets like Utah, Texas, and   South Carolina, but big markets like California are actually in   decline. National installers like SolarCity and Vivint Solar are   also dealing with a ""quicker than expected"" customer shift from   leases and power purchase agreements to loans.Despite the decline in residential solar last quarter, this   remains a segment with a lot of potential long-term. A relatively   small number of states -- including California, Massachusetts,   and Arizona -- have long accounted for most rooftop solar demand,   and as more states open up the segment will grow. But it could be   a choppy transition, particularly for companies without flexible   business models to adapt to customer preference.What we learned in Q3 2016Overall, the solar industry is hitting record levels primarily   because of its cost competitiveness in a growing number of   states. And investors should take some comfort in the fact that   demand for utility projects in 2017 is growing and commercial   demand is picking up steam.With that said, the next year or two will be challenging for   residential solar as well as utility demand in some states.   Investors will want to look at the industry cautiously, because   record high demand doesn't mean everyone in the solar industry is   seeing a bright future.10 stocks we like better than Vivint SolarWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Magna International May Soon Build a New Auto Factory;12/14/2016;"Auto-industry supplier and contract manufacturerMagna International(NYSE: MGA) may soon build a new auto factory, a key executive   said this week.Magna's primary business is focused on making components for   the big global automakers. But it also manufactures complete   vehicles: The company's Magna Steyr unit runs an auto factory in   Austria that has made vehicles for several different automakers   over many decades.Apparently, demand is growing for these services -- and that   has implications for all automakers, as well as some companies   that might be looking to enter the auto industry.makeArticleAd();Mercedes-Benz G-Series SUVs roll down the production line at   Magna's contract auto factory in Graz, Austria. Image source:   Magna International.What Magna saidThe head of Magna Steyr's European business, Guenther   Apfalter, told a German trade magazine this week that demand may   be strong enough to warrant construction of a factory near its   existing plant in Graz, Austria.Right now, the Graz plant builds Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUVs   forDaimler AG(NASDAQOTH: DDAIF) . It recently wrapped up production of the   Mini Countryman forBMW AG(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) , and will begin building BMW's 5 Series   starting next spring. Later in the year, it's expected to begin   building the battery-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV forTata Motors(NYSE: TTM) . Another yet-to-be-announced model from Jaguar Land   Rover is also headed to Graz, possibly in 2018.Apparently, there's demand for even more, and one factory   might not be enough. In a German-languageinterviewwith Germany'sAutomobil Produktion, Apfalter said that the Graz factory is likely to hit its   maximum production capacity by the end of 2018, if not   before.""We are looking at potential locations in Europe, North   America, and China,"" for a new factory, Apfalter said. ""Should   Graz overflow, a new plant nearby would be an option,"" possibly   in Slovenia.He said a decision was likely sometime in the next few   months.Why this is important for the whole auto industryThere are huge contract manufacturers for many things (like   cellphones) in Asia. But auto manufacturing requires hugely   expensive specialized tooling, some of which is specific to a   given model. There are no contract manufacturers for cars --   aside from Magna Steyr.For decades, Magna Steyr has had a profitable business making   vehicles for the big automakers. Sometimes it's a small-volume   model like Mercedes' highly specialized G Series, and sometimes   (as with the BMW 5 Series) Magna provides extra production   capacity to help meet strong demand. The Graz facility can build   internal-combustion, hybrid, and fully electric vehicles.With companies fromAppletoAlphabetto a host of start-ups contemplating various ways to enter the   auto business, demand for contract auto manufacturing could   increase sharply in coming years.Magna's strong hint that it will add a second factory to its   contract-manufacturing operation suggests that it wants to   position itself as an option for those new industry entrants.   That could be very profitable for Magna -- and very helpful to   upstart would-be automakers.The upshot: Another area to watch as the auto industry   evolvesBuilding a new high-volume auto factory from scratch can be a   billion-dollar investment, out of the range of many start-ups and   emerging companies.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has essentially bootstrapped its factory,   expanding from a small production line as its business (and   income) has grown. But that has been a slow process, and other   potential market entrants might not be willing to wait.For companies that want a high-quality contract manufacturer   for vehicles, Magna Steyr is (right now at least) the only game   in town. Its hints that it will soon invest the considerable sums   needed for a second factory suggest that it knows a lot of new   business is on the way. For those interested in the ongoing   transformation of the auto industry, this is something worth   watching.10 stocks we like better than Magna     InternationalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

General Motors' Chevy Bolt Just Officially Beat Tesla Motors to Market;12/14/2016;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) said that it delivered its first three Chevrolet Bolt   EVs to paying customers on Tuesday, fulfilling a promise made by   CEO Mary Barra that sales of the innovative electric car would   begin by the end of 2016.What GM said about the first Chevy Bolt salesGM said that the first Bolts to be sold at retail were   delivered to three customers at Fremont Chevrolet in Fremont,   California. All three customers had previously owned hybrid or   electric vehicles.makeArticleAd();Bobby Edmonds, William ""Bill"" Mattos, and Steve Henry became   the first three customers to take delivery of new Chevrolet Bolt   EVs in Fremont, California, on Tuesday. Image source: General   Motors.One customer, who purchased a Bolt to replace aBMWi3, said that he was attracted to the electric Chevy by its range   and technology, and by the fact that GM is an American   company.GM executives were understandably pleased. ""All of the hard   work that the Chevrolet team have put into designing, engineering   and building the Bolt EV brings us to this truly satisfying   moment of making the first deliveries to customers on time, as   planned,"" said Alan Batey, president of GM North America and   Chevrolet brand chief. ""Chevrolet is proud to offer a vehicle   like the Bolt EV, with ground-breaking technology wrapped in a   modern design that is also fun to drive at an affordable   price.""For now, GM is building and shipping only a small number of   Chevy BoltsGM is rolling its little electric crossover out slowly,   currently building about 100 Bolts a day, according to an   Automotive News report.GM's factory in Orion, Michigan is reportedly building about   100 Bolts a day. It has the capacity to ramp up significantly if   demand is strong. Image source: General Motors.Shipments are ramping up, too. GM said that more Bolts are   currently in transit to dealers in California and Oregon, set to   arrive before the end of December. Dealers in a few other   markets, including New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia, will   receive their first Bolts sometime this winter.More will be rolled out in the spring, and GM expects the Bolt   to be available at ""Bolt EV-certified"" Chevy dealers nationwide   by about the middle of 2017.GM has a window of opportunity to poach buyers from   TeslaThe Bolt's price tag ($37,495 before a $7,500 federal tax   credit) and range (EPA-estimated at 238 miles) have made it an   appealing alternative to a high-pricedTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S or Model X, at least on paper -- and put   it a big step ahead of mass-market-priced electric vehicles from   other automakers.But the Bolt -- by design -- is very different from the   high-performing and sleekly styled Teslas. The Teslas were   designed to compete head-to-head with German luxury cars, but the   Bolt was created with ride-hailing and car-sharing duties in   mind: It's essentially a 21st century taxicab.The Bolt is a fine choice for someone who wants an electric   commuter car with good acceleration and a roomy back seat, but   nobody will call it sexy like a Model S.That would put the Bolt at a disadvantage (at retail, at   least) if Tesla had a car in the Bolt's price range. That car,   the Tesla Model 3, is in development. Tesla hopes to have it in   production by the end of 2017, though many analysts think mid- to   late 2018 is more realistic. Either way, that gives GM a window   of opportunity.The Bolt isn't a Tesla -- but unlike Tesla's upcoming   ""affordable"" Model 3, it's available now. That gives GM a chance   to poach some buyers from the Silicon Valley automaker.One last thought: The location of the first Bolt EV sales was   no accidentBy the way, I don't think it was a coincidence that the first   Bolts were delivered in Fremont, California. Tesla's factory is   in Fremont, and I think GM enjoys giving its electric rival a   poke in the eye. After all, GM did beat Tesla to market with an   affordable long-range electric car.Don't get too offended, Tesla fans: GM has done this kind of   thing with its crosstown Detroit rivals (and vice-versa) for   decades. Extending it to Tesla is arguably a mark of respect.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

""As demand for   ridesharing continues to skyrocket, the future of transportation   will be a mix of human drivers and self-driving cars.""But there are a couple catches to Uber's new ""self-driving""   cars in San Francisco.Are these vehicles really autonomous?""San Francisco, your Self-Driving Uber is arriving now,"" reads   an Uber's Wednesday morning blog post. This bold statement,   however, isn't quite accurate.Later in the same post Uber says, ""For us, it's still early   days and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person   monitoring them."" Like Uber's vehicles deployed in Pittsburgh,   these new ""self-driving"" vehicles require a driver to sit up   front to ensure the ride goes normally. If something goes wrong,   these operators need to take over the wheel.Furthermore, there's a debate about whether Uber even has   permission to operate vehicles like this in San Francisco. The   state of California requires companies testing self-driving   vehicles to obtain a permit to test these vehicles, and Uber   doesn't have one.Going into Uber's launch of its five self-driving vehicles in   San Francisco on Wednesday, the ride-hailing company is aware of   the controversy. Uber acknowledged the issue in its blog post:   ""Finally, we understand that there is a debate over whether or   not we need a testing permit to launch self-driving Ubers in San   Francisco. We have looked at this issue carefully and we don't   believe we do.""California rules don't apply to their situation since the   permit is intended for cars that drive without someone   controlling or monitoring them, according to Uber.But the California DMV disagrees,reportsThe Wall Street Journalon Wednesday. ""Twenty manufacturers have already obtained   permits to test hundreds of cars on California roads. Uber shall   do the same,"" said the DMV.Permit or not, Uber is clearly adamant about pushing the   envelope when it comes to deploying and testing autonomous   technologyTesla's advantage over UberInterestingly, Uber's questionable strategy for testing   autonomous driving technology in Pittsburgh and San Francisco   highlights a major advantage electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , which alsoplans to launch its own self-driving ride-hailing   service, has over Uber.Tesla demonstrated a self-driving Model S. Image source: Tesla   Motors.By beginning toinclude sensors for autonomous driving in every   vehiclein October, Tesla is able to operate its vehicles' new   sensors in ""shadow mode,"" collecting data from every new   vehicle's driving and determining how systems would have   performed in different situations. Not only will this shadow mode   data help Tesla refine its self-driving software before it is   released, but it will also help serve as a benchmark for   regulators to illustrate how the technology can increase safety,   Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said.Therefore, while Uber's San Francisco launch highlights a   debate about regulatory challenges with testing self-driving   technology, the more notable takeaway may be the weakness in   Uber's overall approach. Uber's small number of vehicles for   testing autonomous driving technology in Pittsburgh and San   Francisco pales in comparison to Tesla's current production rate   of 100,000 vehicles annually. Tesla's biggest advantage over Uber   in preparing to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service may be   its ability to generate far more data from self-driving   sensors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks for 2017: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Soaring;12/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEditor's note: This column is part of our Best Stocks for     2017 contest. Louis Navellier's pick for the contest isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Self-driving cars. Virtual reality headsets. Artificial   intelligence. The past year has brought incredible advances in   technologies that defied the imagination not too long ago. My   best stocks for 2017 pick is at the forefront of these   fast-growing technologies - and is profiting handsomely from   them.makeArticleAd();Nvidia Corporation(NASSDAQ:NVDA) is a leading computer graphics company, making graphic   processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses. From video   games to professional visualization, datacenter and automotive   applications, Nvidia's graphics cards enhance the processing   capability of its users' computers.The company has been in the computer graphics business for   more than two decades - it invented the GPU in 1999 - so it is a   well-established player. To date, Nvidia owns 7,300 patents   relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its   kind.NVDA Stock Powering UpWhile NVDA stock got its start as a graphics card company that   catered to video game enthusiasts, it turns out that the GPU has   a wide range of powerful applications. Graphics cards can be used   to aid computers in applications like financial modeling, oil and   gas exploration, virtual reality and even in self-driving   cars.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017To that last point, Nvidia currently has partnerships with   many leading automakers, includingAudi,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Mercedes-Benz,Volvo,Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:HMC) andBMW. As self-driving cars become more widely adopted, NVDA stock's   artificial intelligence car computing platform will be in hot   demand.This is on top of Nvidia's already explosive growth. Last   quarter, revenue soared 54% to a new record of $2 billion, up   from $1.3 billion in the third quarter a year ago. Earnings per   share surged 104% year-over-year to 94 cents, up from 46 cents in   the same quarter a year ago.The analyst community was expecting earnings of 57 cents per   share on $1.69 billion in sales, so NVDA stock posted a stunning   65% earnings surprise and an 18.3% sales surprise.And Nvidia is expected to keep up the pace for the foreseeable   future. For the fourth quarter, NVDA now expects revenue of $2.1   billion, which represents 50% annual sales growth. Analysts are   also forecasting 137% earnings growth. For the next several   quarters, the company is expected to maintain double-digit sales   and earnings growth.I must also mention that for more than four years, Nvidia has   paid a consistent quarterly dividend. In November 2012, the   quarterly payout was 7.5 cents per share. This past quarter, it   paid 14 cents per share, over an 86% increase. At current prices,   NVDA has a 0.6% annual dividend yield and a 22% 12-month dividend   growth rate.

Alphabet Inc.'s Self-Driving Car Project Becomes a Company, Gets a Name;12/14/2016;"Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google self-driving car project   is no longer just a project. Starting today, the tech company's   self-driving car efforts have graduated from the Google X   research unit, as one of Alphabet's ""moonshots,"" to an official   Alphabet business called Waymo.Self-driving car. Image source: Waymo.makeArticleAd();""Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility. We're a   self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe   and easy for people and things to move around,"" Waymo said in a   blog post on Tuesday.Alphabet's launch of Waymo comes nearly eight years after the   company began working on self-driving cars, but it enters what is   quickly turning into a fiercely competitive market asTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) asserts it isalready including self-driving sensors in every   vehicleand as other auto manufacturers, tech companies, and ride-hailing   services explore ways to monetize the nascent technology.Meet WaymoWaymo was careful to emphasize that this is not the beginning   of Alphabet's efforts in this important space, but rather the   culmination of years of work.""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced   self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,""   said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in the company's blog   post.Waymo technology. Image source: Waymo.Alphabet knew it was time for Waymo to begin the process of   becoming its own company when the former Google X project   completed ""the world's first fully self driven car ride"" in late   2015, Krafcik said. Navigating through Austin's suburbs with   legally blind passenger Steve Mahan, Alphabet says the drive   reflected everyday driving situations.Mahan explained the importance of this milestone:The ability to complete a fully self-driven trip on everyday     public roads, with no test driver, was a big milestone for our     team and the history of this technology. It was the signal that     we could begin to shift our focus from foundational technical     work toward launching our own company so we can offer many more     rides, in more places, for more people.Self-driving technology -- not self-driving     carsInterestingly, in conjunction with the announcement of Waymo   today, Alphabet is reportedly backing off any plans to   manufacture and sell its own self-driving cars, opting instead to   partner with auto manufacturers in order to deploy the   technology, according toThe Information's Amir Efrati.Alphabet has backed off plans to develop a revolutionary car     without a steering wheel or pedals, at least for now, according     to people close to the closely watched project. Instead, the     self-driving car pioneer has settled on a more practical effort     to partner with automakers to make a vehicle that drives itself     but has traditional features for human drivers.And a comment from Waymo's Krafcik during a press conference   on Tuesday seems to confirm the new company's choice to abstain   from auto manufacturing for now. ""We've been really clear that   we're not a car company,"" Krafcik said (viaThe New York Times). ""We're not in the business of making better cars. We're in the   business of making better drivers.""Tesla recently released a video of a Model S driving itself.   Image source: Tesla Motors.Alphabet's decision to refrain from manufacturing its own   self-driving vehicles differs from Tesla's emphasis on both the   self-driving technology and the manufacturing of self-driving   vehicles and it means Tesla doesn't have to worry about the   technology giant becoming a direct competitor -- for now.   However, it's worth noting it was never certain Alphabet ever   intended on manufacturing its own vehicles in the first   place.Given how competitive and capital intensive the auto market   is, focusing solely on the self-driving technology may arguably   be the better move for software-centric Alphabet's Waymo. Indeed,   Waymo isn't the only major company to acknowledge the challenge   ambitious manufacturing plans could bring about. By focusing on   the autonomous driving software instead of building self-driving   cars, Alphabet's Waymo vision mimics a recent report thatApplehas also shifted its focus from building its own self-driving car   to emphasizing the development of the underlying technology for   autonomous driving.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Yellen, Trump and Tech: Will They Help Dow Hit 20K?;12/14/2016;"Wednesday, December 13, 2016makeArticleAd();Ahead of the opening bell this morning, the Producer Price Index (PPI) - a key inflation metric - for November looks to be running hot at +0.4%, both as the headline number and after stripping out (more volatile) food and energy costs.

Can Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Keep This Fire Burning?;12/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicroprocessor firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) has nearly tripled so far this year. Investors are growing increasingly enthusiastic that its transformation from a purely graphics chip firm to a purveyor of graphics processing units (GPUs) will send sales and cash flow - and as a result, NVDA stock - significantly higher in the coming years.makeArticleAd();Source:via NvidiaBased off the run in Nvidia shares, the company is already a bona fide success. But most of the run has come on an expansion of NVDA's earnings multiple. That said, earnings expectations have run 32% higher - from $1.84 per share to $2.42 per share - over the past 90 days. That's pretty solid earnings momentum.The key question for prospective investors: Will the momentum in fundamentals continue? Based off current valuations, significant growth already is priced into NVDA stock. That could leave a lot of room for disappointment.On the flip side, the markets that Nvidia is actively targeting are arguably in a revolutionary stage.A Look at Nvidia's Recent ResultsRevenue for Nvidia's third quarter jumped 53.5% to $2 billion. Management called it a ""breakout"" quarter where revenue and earnings hit records. Net income jumped to $570 million, or 94 cents per share of NVDA stock.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Growth was strongest in selling chips and related systems that power video games, datacenters run by the likes ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and a burgeoning automotive market.Nvidia's most important segment is gaming. Customers in this segment includeSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) and its PlayStation franchise. The company mentioned games including Battlefield 1, Call of Duty, and eSports for deploying its Pascal-based graphics processing units (GPUs). Annual gaming growth has been stellar at 30% annually over the last three years.Gaming sales increased 63% and exceeded $1 billion to account for more than half of total revenue. Professional visualization is the next largest unit but only saw a modest increase to $207 million in quarterly sales. This unit provides chips for a mix of industries, including media and entertainment.Automotive sales jumped 61%, but at $127 million are still a small percent of the total pie (6%). The auto segment has huge upside potential because of excitement surrounding development of self-driving cars.Nvidia's Growth DriversNvidia serves huge markets that continue to grow. It estimates the gaming market at $100 billion and its market share at only 3.5%.Automotive represents a total market over $10 trillion. Nvidia is fast positioning itself as the chip provider of choice to automotive companies. Its systems are already present in more than 10 million vehicles around the world. During its earnings conference call, it detailed thatTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)is powering its autonomous car system with its Nvidia Drive PX 2 that are more than 40 times faster than earlier technologies.The datacenter segment is another growth avenue. NVDA partners withVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) and Citrix in this market. So far this year, growth is running at 121% to represent the fastest growth market for the company. Its datacenter GPU also happens to be known as Tesla, and it has been used in scientific applications to help improve heart surgery and mapping of the human genome.Artificial intelligence also is turning out to be a huge growth avenue. Nvidia defines AI as the use of computers to recreate human thinking and intelligence. This covers deep learning frameworks, such as big data applications that collect and track information on servers and cloud-based networks. It also covers self-driving cars where AI technology drives an automobile and helps steer it clear from accidents.Bottom Line for NVDA StockNvidia is ambitiously pursuing growth in gaming, automotive, as well as artificial intelligence applications. Based off total expected revenue growth of 37% to nearly $7 billion for this year, the potential appears to be great.Nothing Will Save Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock. Nothing.Unfortunately for prospective investors in NVDA stock, the share price has continued to move upward and may have run ahead of what is supported by the fundamentals. The profit expectation for this year is $2.42 per share. The stock is currently trading at 38X these estimates.This doesn't mean that investors should avoid the stock completely. Keep an eye on the earnings trend - if it continues to move upward, the stock should continue to move upward. The chip business is also cyclical - an overall downturn in the industry could knock Nvidia stock down too.Looking at Nvidia's past results could also deceive investors. Sales had been stuck in the $4 billion range for the better part of a decade. That ticked up slightly over the last couple of years, and appears to be building steam.Given the vastness and growth potential of the current markets being served, the upside  in NVDA stock is appealing.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in of the other aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017The 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The postCan Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Keep This Fire Burning?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

General Motors' All-Electric Chevrolet Bolt Deliveries Begin;12/13/2016;"Living up to its promise,General Motors(NYSE: GM) delivered the first affordable fully electric vehicle   with over 200 miles today. Perhaps in a move to rub it in, the   Chevrolet Bolt was delivered in the same city in which   electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) builds its vehicles: Fremont, California.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.makeArticleAd();Here they come""All of the hard work that the Chevrolet team have put into   designing, engineering and building the Bolt EV brings us to this   truly satisfying moment of making the first deliveries to   customers on-time, as planned,"" said GM North America president   Alan Batey in a company press release announcing the first three   deliveries of its Bolt, which boasts 238 miles or EPA-rated range   on a single charge and an impressive $37,500 price tag. ""Only   Chevrolet is able to offer a vehicle like the Bolt EV,"" Batey   boasted, ""with ground-breaking technology wrapped in a modern   design that is also fun-to-drive at an affordable price.""The first three deliveries went to customers in California   cities Fremont, Castro Valley, and Portola Valley.""The range and technology attracted me to the Bolt EV,"" said   Castro Valley's Bobby Edmonds. ""It's also a great-looking, roomy   vehicle, and I love the fact it's from an American brand. I look   forward to the longer drives I can make compared to the i3 that I   owned.""Though GM is living up to its promise by beginning Bolt   deliveries before the end of the year, investors should note that   the vehicle will only be available in limited quantities. Beyond   initial deliveries in California, Bolt deliveries will make their   way to ""a number of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States including   New York, Massachusetts and Virginia"" this winter, General Motors   said. And the vehicle will hit ""additional major metro markets""   during the first half of next year, with nationwide availability   at ""Bolt EV-certified dealerships"" in mid-2017.General Motors' reportedly plans to producearound 20,000 to 50,000 Bolt units next year.An important milestoneWhile General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt is unlikely to have any   meaningful impact on the company's financial results in the near   future, investors still shouldn't underestimate the importance of   the first Bolt deliveries. The Bolt is a notable achievement for   a number of reasons, including:The Bolt's 238 miles range on a single charge makes it the     first electric vehicle to have comparable range to Tesla     vehicles. Further, the range is higher than the 215-plus miles     Tesla has promised for its upcoming $35,000 Model 3.The Bolt's price is even more noteworthy; at $37,500, the     vehicle has more range than the base Tesla Model S' 218 miles     of EPA-rated range and costs 45% less than the luxury     sedan.It signals General Motors' commitment to long-range     electric vehicles. With sales of long-range EVs growing at 50%     annually and expected to continue growing at this rate for     years to come, General Motors is dipping its toes in a     promising market.It shows General Motors won't let Tesla launch its Model 3     without a fight.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Setting apart its more ambitious vision for electric vehicle   production, Tesla plans to begin delivering Model 3 during the   second half of 2017 and expects to achieve volume deliveries   before 2017 is over. Further, Tesla expects Model 3 will help   take the company's annualized production from a build rate of   100,000 units today to 500,000 in 2018.Of course, investors shouldn't discount General Motors' Bolt   production just because the company isn't aiming for the same   delivery volume as Tesla is with its Model 3. Tesla's plans   remain targets while GM's Bolt is already in the hands of   customers.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Electric Minivan Could Be a Hit;12/13/2016;"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) plans to unveil a fully electric vehicle based on   the Chrysler Pacifica minivan at the Consumer Electronics Show   (CES) in Las Vegas next month, according to a Bloombergreport.FCA is also working on a battery-electric Maserati sports car   that will aim to compete with the premium electrics fromTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , the report said.makeArticleAd();The stylish Chrysler Pacifica Minivan is already available as   a plug-in hybrid. Is a fully electric version the next step?   Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.What do we know about the new electric Pacifica?We don't know much. Officially, FCA hasn't said anything at   all, and the Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed ""people   familiar with the plans,"" was short on details.But we can draw some conclusions from the fact that it will   reportedly be based on the Pacifica, rather than on a small car   or crossover. For starters, it seems likely that the choice of   the Pacifica, and the decision to unveil the new electric at CES,   are signals that this new electric model will be more than a   so-called ""compliance car.""What's a ""compliance car""?Battery-electric vehicles that were developed from models   originally designed for internal combustion, likeFord'sFocus Electric and FCA's own Fiat 500e, are often (and somewhat   derisively) referred to as ""compliance cars.""Vehicles like these tend to have ranges of around 100 miles   (or less) compromises in their packaging (batteries filling much   of the former trunk, for instance), and high prices. Enthusiasts   argue that they seem less about drawing eager customers and more   about satisfying a regulatory requirement as cheaply as   possible.Why should we think the electric Pacifica will be more than   that?Well, first of all, FCA already has a compliance car, the   aforementioned Fiat 500e. It doesn't need another.But there are other reasons why FCA might have chosen the   Pacifica as the basis for its first longer-range EV. The Pacifica   is a new design that is already available in a plug-in hybrid   version. That plug-in Pacifica is a technologically advanced   vehicle -- enough so that it waschosen as a test platformforAlphabet's Google Self-Driving Car Project.But more to the point, the plug-in hybrid drivetrain was part   of the Pacifica's engineering from the start, not tacked on   later. As you can see from the cutaway illustration below, the   hybrid battery pack is below the van's floor. It doesn't take too   much imagination to visualize a larger battery pack in the same   general location, especially if the gasoline engine is   replaced by a much smaller electric motor.Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.It's very possible that the Pacifica was engineered from the   start with the possibility of a larger battery pack in mind, one   that would give an electric Pacifica a range of 200 miles or   so.An electric minivan with good range and a mass-market price   would be an intriguing product. Fold in the Pacifica's unusually   (for a minivan) stylish good looks, and it could catch on as an   affordable alternative to Tesla's Model X for green-minded   families that need a big kid-hauler.What about that electric Maserati?Back in 2014, FCA's Maserati brand showed a prototype of a   sleek high-performance coupe called the Alfieri. A production   version is expected to arrive around 2019, and there have been   strong hints from the company that an all-electric Alfieri will   follow about a year later.A production version of 2014's Maserati Alfieri concept car is   expected to arrive in 2019. An electric version could arrive a   year or so later. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.As with everything having to do with FCA, particularly when it   comes to the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, it's very possible   that schedules will slip and products will be delayed or changed.   But the industry rumor mill strongly suggests that the company's   current plan is to deliver an electric coupe that will probably   look very similar to the show car pictured above.What would this mean for Fiat Chrysler?It's a big shift for FCA. CEO Sergio Marchionne has said   repeatedly that he thinks it will be years before battery costs   fall to the point where electric cars make business sense.But despite that concern, he said in June that he wanted FCA   to experiment more with electric drivetrains. He has recently   pushed FCA to more aggressively embrace other advancing   technologies, including partnerships with potentially disruptive   Silicon Valley giants.In addition to partnering with Google on self-driving, FCA is   also working withAmazon.comon a pilot program tosell cars directly to customers online. It's possible that we will learn in January that FCA has found   one or more partners to help speed its electric-car development   as well.What's next for FCA's electric-vehicle effort?Again, it's hard to say until we have a better idea of what   the company is planning. We should know much more after FCA makes   its presentation at CES on Jan. 3.10 stocks we like better than Fiat Chrysler     AutomobilesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech and Trump: Can They Find Common Ground in New York?;12/13/2016;"Tomorrow, all eyes will be on New York City's Trump Tower as President-Elect Donald Trump sits down with Silicon Valley's top tech leaders. While the meeting's agenda has yet to be disclosed, it is safe to assume themes like job creation, immigration, regulation, and encryption will all be likely discussion topics.It's been well documented that the vast majority of Silicon Valley leaders opposed Trump during the presidential election, with some helping and fund-raising for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during her campaign. The Obama administration has acted largely favorable towards large tech corporations over the years, from its ""net-neutrality"" policy-which requires internet providers to treat all web traffic equally-to its hands-off tactics to the tech industry's growing concentration of power.Joining Trump on his side of the table will be Reince Preibus, his chief of staff, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and key transition team member Peter Thiel, a tech investor who was one of the few Silicon Valley names to support Mr. Trump.Expected tech executives include:AppleAAPLChief Executive Tim CookFacebookFBChief Operating Officer andLean Inauthor Sheryl SandbergMicrosoftMSFTCEO Satya NadellaAmazonAMZNCEO andThe Washington Postowner Jeff BezosTesla MotorsTSLACEO Elon MuskAlphabetGOOGLCEO and Chairman Larry Page and Eric SchmidtIntelINTCCEO Brian KrzanichIBMIBMCEO Ginni RomettyOracleORCLco-CEO Safra CatzCiscoCSCOCEO Chuck RobbinsSurprisingly, TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey will not be present at the meeting, given how much Mr. Trump prefers the social networking platform over others.Many of these tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, saw theirshares slidethe day after the election on worries that a Trump presidency would negatively affect their manufacturing and product distribution methods here in the U.S. and especially abroad.One area of common ground, however, could be tax reform. According to theWall Street Journal, the president-elect is ""expected to promote corporate tax reform, which, depending on the details, could enable U.S. tech companies to bring home hundreds of billions of dollars they currently hold offshore.""The meeting is set for 2:00pm on Wednesday afternoon, and the world will be watching, waiting to learn all the minute details, hoping for, at least, some agreement on key issues, and realizing that the tech industry and Mr. Trump may need more from each other than either is willing to give.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Why Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) Stock Could Blast Off in 2017;12/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSirius XM Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ:SIRI) has had a pretty good year in terms of stock price. SIRI stock has improved by more than year-to-date and roughly 36% since its February low. Shares even hit a 10-year high in November.Source:Vinod Sankar via FlickrWith the 2016 remaining just a few weeks, it's almost certain that SIRI stock will record a positive year altogether, barring any late market fiasco, of course.makeArticleAd();The question now is if Sirius XM Radio shares can enjoy another (or an even more) stellar year in 2017.I think the answer is a resounding ""yes.""The State of SIRI StockSirius XM literally owns the satellite radio market. As of the end of the third quarter, SIRI had more than 31 million subscribers compared to just under 29 million a year ago. Impressively, the company has reported 28 consecutive profitable quarters as of the third quarter. Sirius XM also has been pretty consistent in growing revenues over the past decade.However, the investment community isn't particularly upbeat about the future of SIRI stock. The worry? That satellite radio is atransitory technologyat risk of becoming obsolete. The smartphone revolution as well as the growing popularity of connected cars instills the belief that internet radio - not satellite radio - is the future.Merger With PandoraCNBC reported that internet radio giantPandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) is open to an acquisition by Sirius XM. This is something of a reversal, asPandora reportedly rejected a $15-per-share offerfrom SIRI earlier in the year.5 Tech Stocks That Should Top Your 2016     Christmas Wish ListIf the two do pair up, it's likely to be announced in 2017. Such a merger will effectively reduce fears that Sirius XM is going away sometime soon, as it will address the oncoming force of Internet radio by … well, joining it.As RBC analystMark Mahaneysaid, this would allow Sirius XM to diversify its revenue streams as well as customer base. Sirius currently depends on subscription for its revenue; Pandora's sales come primarily on ad dollars.Moreover, having access to Pandora's customers would give SIRI stock an avenue for upsells. Not to mention, a Sirius XM-Pandora merger would likely increase the combined appeal of the joined companies to advertisers.The potential for revenue growth in this prospective deal is wide and considerable.Don't Count Out a Sirius XM Video App, EitherWhen Howard Stern signed a new contract with Sirius XM last year, the company also announced a possible video-as-a-platform initiative. While SIRI execs haven't been forthcoming regarding the details of the video service, Stern was upbeat.Sirius' James Meyer said during the third quarter earnings call that the company had signed an agreement withWhalerockto plot a path for how SIRI can use video to improve its services over the long-term. He hinted that the video service would launch next year.It's unclear whether Sirius is planning to monetize the video content based on its traditional subscription model. We'll have to wait until the service launches. If SIRI takes the route of making its video content available on subscription, it's difficult to see how it'll yield any significant growth for the company. The internet is littered with tons of free video services already. Not many folks will be willing to pay for it, except the service somehow comes bundled with the usual sat-rad subscription.The smarter route to take would be using the video content to simply grow Sirius XM's popularity, thereby, allowing for improved organic growth of its radio business. Again, we'll have to wait to see the path the company takes.The Latest Apple Inc. (AAPL) Delay: BeatsX     EarbudsSo SIRI stock holders should keep an eye out for developments on this front, too.Bottom Line on Sirius XMIf Sirius XM can pull off either of the above catalysts, expect 2017 to be another stellar year for SIRI stock.Also, I think the fear regarding the future of Sirius' satellite radio business is blown out of proportion. The company keeps growing its subscriber base too fast for a company that's at risk of obsolescence.A freshly minted dividend also should give shareholders more confidence in the company's financial standing.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceDoes Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in     Your IRA?Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Top Tech Leaders to Meet Trump: 4 Stocks in Focus;12/12/2016;"Reportedly, technology leaders are set to meet President-elect Donald Trump in a summit to be held on Wednesday (Dec 14, 2016). PerThe Wall Street Journal, the small selective group is expected to include top-executives from Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, IBMIBM, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle Corp., along with Tesla Motor'sTSLAElon Musk.makeArticleAd();The event is significant for the technology and allied sector as it grapples with growing uncertainty over Trump administration's economic policies and its impact on the industry.Notably, top-most technology leaders of the Silicon Valley had openly protested against Trump's rhetoric during election campaign. The President-elect had threatened to force technology companies like Apple to bring their overseas manufacturing operations back to the U.S.Moreover, Trump's views over antitrust enforcement, trade protectionism, immigration policy (particularly issuance of H1B visas used to hire skilled foreigners) and net-neutrality (Donald Trump is known as a criticizer of this policy) are some of the major headwinds for the U.S. technology companies like IBM, Alphabet and NetflixNFLX.Another concern is Trump's determination to cut clean energy spending. Most of the big technology companies have been moving toward clean energy with the help of government tax breaks. Any spending cut will certainly be a dampener on these plans.Computer and Technology Sector Price IndexComputer and Technology Sector Price IndexTechnology Sector and Donald Trump - Common GroundDespite the verbal volleys and pre-election enmity, it is now quite clear that none of them - Donald Trump nor the Silicon Valley bigwigs - can ignore each other. For the sake of smooth running of their businesses as well as the U.S. economy, a ""common ground"" is necessary as observed by the Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant.Corporate tax reform that has been blatantly advocated by the President-elect since early days of his campaign is an issue that can bring technology leaders and Donald Trump to a truce.Per data from Moody's Investors Service Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle together made up almost 30% ($504 billion) of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015. According to figures from the WSJ: ""Apple alone holds about 91% of its $237.6 billion in cash offshore.""Notably, the U.S. government currently levies a 35% tax rate on repatriated cash, which Trump has promised to lower to 15%. An ideal restructuring of tax rates will enable companies like Apple to bring back a major part of their offshore cash to the U.S.Will Technology Stocks Rebound?Since Donald Trump's selection (Nov 9), we note that the Zacks Computer & Technology industry has returned a modest 2.12% as compared with S&P 500 Composite's gain of 4.22%.

Tesla's Price Target Slashed: What You Need to Know;12/12/2016;"Monday is opening on a down note forTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors.This morning, analysts at Deutsche Bank announced they   are resuming coverage onTesla stock. That's the good news. The bad news is that Deutsche doesn't   really like what it sees. According to the analyst, the stock   that has lost 12% of its value over the past year might rebound   slightly in 2017 -- but not nearly so much as we once hoped.   Deutsche is reducing its price target on Tesla stock from $290 to   just $215. And while this new target is about 12% above where   Tesla shares sit today, Deutsche is only rating Tesla stock hold   -- not buy.makeArticleAd();Here are three things you need to know about why.Tesla is re-envisioning the electric car with its Model 3 sedan.   Image source: Getty Images.1. Challenging assumptionsTesla has famously boasted that it expects toramp vehicle production to 500,000 unitsannually -- most of them budget-model Model 3 sedans -- by 2018.   Previously, Deutsche took that promise on faith, and built a   valuation model on Tesla stock that assumed the company would hit   its 2018 goal, then go on to produce as many as 650,000 Model 3s   annually by 2020 -- but now, Deutsche's not so sure.According to a write-up onStreetInsider.comthis morning, Deutsche still believes that ""EV growth will   surprise as costs converge with ICEs."" But the analyst is pulling   back from its previous prediction of 650,000 units sold in 2020,   and now predicts Tesla will sell only 450,000 Model 3s that   year.2. Trust, but verifyMind you, Deutsche's new estimate doesn't necessarily mean   that Elon Musk's estimate is wrong. If Tesla were to produce   450,000 Model 3s in 2020 (as Deutsche now predicts), and produces   a few more Model S units, Model X units, and perhaps a handful of   redesigned Roadsters -- it could still reach Musk's goal of   500,000 total electric cars produced in 2018, 2019, and 2020, as   well. All Deutsche is saying is that it's decided to build   ""additional conservatism into our assumptions for the Model 3   ramp.""Even so, Deutsche's new estimate implies less free cash flow   being generated by Tesla. And based on this, the analyst is   cutting its ""discounted cash flow derived"" target on Tesla's cars   business, yielding an implied price target of $214 on this half   of the company, instead of the previous target of $290.3. What about the rest of Tesla?If you've noticed by now that $214 is not the same thing as   $215, then kudos for paying attention. Here's how Deutsche   explains that tiny disconnect: The final piece of the Tesla   puzzle is SolarCity, the solar power business that   Teslaacquiredlast month. Many investorsopposed this moveby Tesla when it was first announced. Surprisingly, Deutsche is   not one of them.As detailed in its report, Deutsche believes that   Tesla-qua-Tesla is worth $214 today, based on where the analyst   thinks it will be in 2020. The analyst proceeds to discount that   value by $14 based on an assumption that Tesla willdilute its stockholderswith additional share issuances to cover a $2.5 billion shortfall   in cash requirements between now and 2020. This brings the value   of Tesla's car business down to $200. What takes it up again to$215is the value of adding SolarCity to the mix.Albeit Deutsche doesn't think SolarCity is worth the $20.45   that its shares ended up selling for, it does admit that ""with   SCTY we derive a target of $215"" -- $200 for the cars business,   and another $15 for SolarCity.The most important thing: SkepticismEven after all this math and even after convincingitselfthat Tesla stock is worth 12% more than it currently costs,   Deutsche Bank still cannot bring itself to recommend that anyone   actually buy Tesla shares. I think that's a prudent call.As Deutsche's recommendation demonstrates, valuing Tesla today   requires a lot of assumptions -- about the rate at which Tesla   can ramp electric car production, about the car-buying public's   willingness to switch from gasoline-powered automobiles to   electrics, and about Tesla's need to dilute shareholders with   additional share issuances en route to an eventually profitable   future. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to lose money ($874 million   over the past 12 months, according to data fromS&P   Global Market Intelligence) and burn cash ($876 million in negative free cash flow).Until those facts change, Tesla remains a speculative   stock.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Does Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in Your IRA?;12/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA couple of years ago I wrote an article forInvestorPlacethat pittedTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) againstApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) in the ultimate battle of tech darlings. Tesla stock or Apple stock? Which stock should investors entrust their hard-earned money to?Source: TeslaNot an easy decision,thenor now.makeArticleAd();In hindsight, the quick answer to that question is Apple, whose stock has appreciated 16.3% over the past 26 months compared to a 32.8% decline in the TSLA stock price. It's ironic, though, given that Tesla's recent quarters have seen some of its best financial numbers in the company's history, while Apple is mired in sales declines.Why is Tesla stock reversing its field? Why is the world round? There are so many reasons it has gone into a funk the closer it has gotten to actual profitability.A Few Reasons for CautionStill,InvestorPlacefeature writer James Brumley recently provided several reasonswhy it makes sense to wait and see what happens with Teslabefore investors pile on the next leg up to financial immortality.The Best Investments for 2017Specifically, Brumley mentioned three things to consider before buying TSLA stock:Has Elon Musk bitten off more than Tesla can chew with itsSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY) acquisition? Does it really need this distraction as pushes   toward profitability? TSLA's downward trend says investors think   not.Can Tesla get the cost of producing a vehicle in the vicinity   of its gas-powered peers? Industry experts say it costs Tesla   $81,000 to produce a single vehicle. Hedge fund manager Mark   Spiegel reckons with economies of scale and the use of steel   instead of aluminum, Tesla could drop that number to $48,000, 27%   higher than the suggested price of its new, supposedly affordable   Model 3.Competitors likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) are purposely ramping up their electric carproductionso they can offset the great fuel consumption of the Chevy Bolt   and Volt against their bigger SUV gas guzzlers.If the market for electric vehicles expands beyond the 2% to 3% of total vehicles produced every year, the consensus is that Tesla won't be able to keep up.Look,I'm a fan of Elon Musk. It's not Donald Trump who will make America great. It's brilliantly passionate people like the Tesla CEO who will - hands down.""In keeping with a fast-growing technology company, all free cash flow is plowed back into R&D to drive down the costs and bring the following products to market as fast as possible,"" Elon Muskwrotein 2006. ""When someone buys the Tesla Roadster sports car, they are actually helping pay for the development of the low-cost family car.""Brilliant.That said, Tesla is probably not the best stock to have in your 401k or IRA - if you're retiring anytime soon.Tesla Stock Definitely Isn't a Retirement Pick NowHere's what I said in 2014:""I'd suggest you buy an ETF that holds Apple and/or Tesla stock if you're 10 years or less from retirement. If you're between 10 and 20 years to retirement, I'd go with AAPL stock. And if you're 20 or more away from hanging them up, I'd go with Tesla stock.""Nothing's changed in my opinion.Assuming an average retirement age of 65, I'm comfortable recommending that investors 45 or younger seriously consider TSLA stock for their retirement accounts. Of course, many 401k plans - which most people have - either don't allow individual stocks or make it cost prohibitive.If you have a 401k, where it makes sense, buy Tesla, and if it continues to go lower, you've got loads of time for it to recover. And if you can't put it in your 401k, consider putting it into an IRA instead.There's only one caveat.Chesapeake Energy (CHK) Stock Is the Right Way     to Play OPECMake sure TSLA stock represents no more than 5% of the overall market value of your plan, regardless of the type. Besides, your equity funds or ETFs held in the plan will likely own TSLA stock as well, so there's no need to overdo it.Is there risk investing in Tesla stock?Absolutely, there is. But if you diversify appropriately, in 20 years, it won't matter if Tesla ultimately goes broke.I say put TSLA in your retirement accounts, but only if you're prepared to wait.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Gold Stocks to Short Into the Dirt4 Energy Stocks to Gain from Trump's Preferred     EPA ChiefThe 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2017The postDoes Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in Your IRA?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

NVIDIA (NVDA) to Move Further into Autonomous Car Market;12/12/2016;"Over the last few years,NVIDIA CorporationNVDAhas been putting in a lot of effort to strengthen its position in several emerging industries. Apart from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning, the company is working hard to establish itself in the driverless cars industry, and yes, its efforts have been rather impressive.Most recently, NVIDIA achieved another milestone in this space after the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CDMV) granted it a permit for testing self-driving vehicle technology on public roads for the first time.It should be noted that California has been a hotbed for autonomous testing since 2014, as it was the first state that established regulations for self-driving vehicles on its public roads. Since then, various companies including Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Tesla MotorsTSLAhave been cleared by CDMV to test their driverless cars.Notably, since 2015, NVIDIA has been providing various autonomous technologies such as digital instrument clusters, navigation, advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment under its partnerships with several automakers including HondaHMC, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Therefore, we believe that the recent permit to test its driverless cars will encourage various other auto manufacturers to use NVIDIA's processing units in their autonomous driving systems.NVIDIA's Journey in the Driverless Cars SpaceNVIDIA forayed into autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space in 2015 by launching a computer vision system at the Consumer Electronics Show. It hasn't looked back since then and has been continuously bringing new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of this year, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 - the world's most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. The company's Drive PX 2 computer chip for self-driving cars is considered to be as powerful as 150 MacBook Pros, and has the capacity to power 12 video camera inputs and sensor fusion. The chip, according to NVIDIA, can run about 24 trillion deep learning operations per second, thereby enabling driverless cars to determine the next move in a fraction of a second.In Sep 2016, the graphic chip behemoth unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam. Xavier is a system-on-chip (SoC), which is built with an 8-core ARM64-based CPU and a next generation 512 core NVIDIA GPU. The chip also integrates a new computer vision accelerator.As per the company, the processor is capable of delivering 20 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance, while consuming just 20 watts of power. The company anticipates making the processor available to automakers and other groups developing self-driving cars during the fourth quarter of 2017.Huge Growth Potential of the IndustryAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estimates encourage us about NVIDIA's growth prospects in the space. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to capitalize on this opportunity.Bottom LineNVIDIA continues to be the world's biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. The company's efforts toward autonomous vehicle segment indicate that it intends to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. Furthermore, by expanding its business avenues, the company will be able to reduce its dependency on the PC industry, which is currently declining.It should be noted that during the last reported quarterly results, the company witnessed a 61% year-over-year jump in automotive segment revenues, mainly driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars.The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained approximately 179% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor-General industry return of just about 30%.The stock has grabbed the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and strong growth projections. Keeping this in mind, we believe investing in this stock would yield strong returns for your portfolio in the short term.Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Can Intel Challenge NVIDIA in the Self-Driving Car Space?;12/9/2016;"Intel Corporation'sINTCrecent deal wins is anticipated to strengthen its footprint and improve its competitive position against NVIDIANVDAin the self-driving car market. The company recently created a new division called Automated Driving Group (ADG), which focuses on this fast-emerging market.makeArticleAd();Per Intel, the company has already won self-driving car deals worth $1 billion this year. Most prominent among them is the partnership with German carmaker BMW and Mobileye for developing self-driving car technology.Auto parts maker Delphi and Mobileye have also chosen Intel chip to power their self-driving vehicles. Initially, they would be using Intel's Core i7 chip and later on upgrade to an even faster processor that is expected to be launched by the chip-maker in a few weeks time.Intel has said that it is currently involved in 30 vehicle programs, but that number would swell to 49 by 2020. Moreover, the company's venture capital division will invest $250 million over the next two years into autonomous driving technology. The fund will support the development of self driving and other technology (connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), safety and security) for cars globally.INTEL CORP Price and ConsensusINTEL CORP Price and Consensus|INTEL CORP QuoteSelf-driving Car ParticipantsAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista estimates the market for the fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, which will be around 12-13% of the total automotive market.Self-driving car market's rapid growth potential has attracted many technology players like NVIDIA, AlphabetGOOGL, Apple and Baidu. Car makers like TeslaTSLA, General Motors, Toyota, BMW, Volvo, Nissan, Ford, Daimler, Honda and Hyundai have also been in the fray.Notable collaborations include the Ford and Baidu's partnership to jointly invest $150 million in Veldyne Lidar, a maker of light sensor technology. Alphabet has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler under which Google will incorporate its self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles.Separately, Google and Ford Motor have partnered to lead a coalition of companies that will push for federal approval of autonomous cars in the near future. Uber, Lyft and Volvo are other members of this coalition.Further, we note the recent collaboration between Tesla and Microsoft. Under the terms of the partnership, Tesla will use Microsoft's Azure to develop AI technology for its self driving cars.Where Does Intel Stands Against NVIDIA?NVIDIA is already a dominant name in the self-driving car space based on its DRIVE Automotive Technology platform. Moreover, the company's Tegra brand of mobile processors is adaptable for in-car use. The company is also partnering with major car makers like Audi, Tesla, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz.On the other hand, Intel is a relatively new name in the self-driving car space. The company's recent endeavors into the space are a part of its diversification strategy, as its products face intensifying competition in the high performance computing (HPC) market. Moreover, declining PC sales is impacting its top-line growth.Intel expects autonomous vehicles to be a core component in the world of Internet of Things (IoT), due to massive amount of data they will generate. Per Intel's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich by 2020, average autonomous car will create about 40 gigabytes of data each minute.The company anticipates that its chips will be used by autonomous vehicles to process this massive data, which will improve the self-driving technology. Moreover, it has also made some strategic acquisitions like Yogitech, Arynga and Itseez that have expanded its capabilities in terms of security and machine learning technology.Although NVIDIA is still a dominant power in the self-driving car market, we believe that Intel is fast catching up as a formidable challenger.Stock Price MovementWe note that Intel's stock price has underperformed the broader Zacks Electronic Semiconductors industry over the last one year. While the stock generated a modest return of 2.16%, the sector generated a strong return of 30.17%.We also note that Intel's performance is less impressive compared with NVIDIA over the same period. However, Intel's investments in IoT, security and memory could pay off this year. We believe that these investments will help the stock rebound going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 China Stocks to Buy Before They Make a BIG Comeback;12/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDonald Trump's election victory has proved to be a major shot in the arm for most American stocks, but it certainly hasn't helped China stocks. Trump's platform of deregulation and tax cuts may result in a significant boost to U.S. corporate earnings. On the other hand, Trump has had consistently harsh words for U.S. international trading partners, specifically China and Mexico.Source:Maher Najm via FlickrTrumphas accusedChina of ""robbing Americans of billions of dollars of capital and millions of jobs."" He has also threatened to impose a 45% tariff on imported Chinese goods. Is Trump more bark than bite when it comes to China?makeArticleAd();That remains to be seen.Understandably, many U.S.-listed Chinese stocks haven't participated in the post-election rally. Trump may prove to be an unpredictable complication for Chinese companies in the near-term. But long-term investors can take advantage of the rare opportunity to buy some quality stocks following significant pullbacks. There are plenty of Chinese stocks that make fine long-term investments, and investors should buy the Trump-fueled dip.5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberWith that as a backdrop, here are three china stocks to buy on this dip.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU)After dropping more than 5% immediately following the U.S. election,Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) is now only down 0.4% since Nov. 8. Since Trump's victory, the ""Chinese Google"" has held up fairly well compared to the actual Google:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is up only 0.3% since Election Day.BIDU is the top search engine in China, but there's a strong argument that the stock is a better investment than its American counterpart. Incredibly, the internet penetration ratein Chinais still only around 50%.  That leaves plenty of opportunity for future growth.In addition to its dominant position in the Chinese internet space, Baidu has a number of potential long-term growth sources. BIDU owns the second-largest video player in China, iQiyi. The company has also invested heavily in artificial intelligence technology as well.For Americans,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is the leading brand when it comes to driverless cars.Morgan Stanleynow expects the Tesla Model 3 to begin shipping in late 2018. In China, BIDU expects to have its owndriverless caron the market in 2018 as well.When it comes to large-cap China stocks, Baidu is certainly one of the best long-term investment options. Now's the time to buy the dip in BIDU.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA)Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) has its finger on the pulse of two of the fastest-growing segments in technology: e-commerce and cloud services.Those segments are the reason why a company the size of BABA has somehow managed to accelerate its revenue growth in recent quarters. After three straight quarters of revenue growth in the 26% to 28% range, BABA has delivered revenue growth of 33%, 48% and 47% in the past three quarters.Much likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the U.S., e-commerce should provide steady long-term growth for BABA. However, the company'scloud servicessegment is growing faster than any other company's in the world, including AMZN.In many ways, Alibaba stock is a bet on the Chinese economy. Despite Trump's tariff threats,Societe Generalerecently upgraded Chinese stocks from ""Underweight"" to ""Overweight."" The firm believes all emerging market economies will benefit from U.S. economic growth under Trump.The 10 Best IPOs to Buy in 2017Boston Consulting Groupprojects China's economy will grow by $2.3 trillion from 2016 to 2020. BABA stock is the best way for U.S. investors to get exposure to that astounding growth.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd (ADR) (MPEL)I will start off by saying thatMelco Crown Entertainment Ltd (ADR)(NASDAQ:MPEL) is much more of a wildcard than BABA stock or BIDU stock.MPEL is the only U.S.-listed Chinese company that is licensed to operate casinos in the world's largest gambling destination: Macau, China. Gambling is illegal in mainland China, but it is legal in Macau.In 2014, the Chinese government decided it was going to crack down on money laundering in Macau. Macau's VIP gaming revenue subsequently plummeted as Macau high-rollers opted to avoid Macau all-together. After more than two years of declining gaming revenues, Macau recently put together four consecutive months of positive gaming revenue growth.In that four-month stretch, MPEL stock was up 37%. However, justthis week, casino operators received bad news that the Chinese government is now ramping up its regulation of Macau by slashing daily ATM withdrawal limits by 50%. The new rule goes into effect immediately and is intended to reduce currency outflow.It seems as if there has been some nefarious activity in Macau in recent years in addition to gambling. However,Las Vegashad a long history of nefarious activity prior to the modern era of massive growth.MPEL stock sold off by more than 13% on the day that China announced the new ATM restrictions. If investors ignore the noise and focus on the long-term secular growth potential of the legitimate gambling market in Macau, Melco stock is the only U.S.-listed pure play on Macau. The stock is worth a long-term bet, especially following the double-digit sell-off.As of this writing Wayne Duggan was long BABA and   MPEL stock.The post3 China Stocks to Buy Before They Make a BIG Comebackappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors, Inc. Is Gearing Up for Model 3;12/9/2016;"At about half the price of its Model S sedan, electric-car   makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) expects its upcoming Model 3 to turn the company   into a high-volume auto manufacturer. But it will need faster,   bigger production lines in order to pull it off. And its recent   approval to double the size of its car factory in Fremont, CA,   suggests the company isn't messing around.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Tesla needs more spaceEarlier this week, the city of Fremont approved Tesla's plans   to boost the square footage of its factory from 5.3 million to   9.9 million, Electrekreports.The expansion, which will include 11 new buildings at Tesla's   Fremont property, reaffirms the company's commitment to continue   expanding in California, and it will give the company more space   to ramp up and optimize production.Already the state's largest auto-industry employer, following   the expansion, Tesla will be an even more formidable employer in   the Golden State. Reflecting the significant investments needed   to support higher volume Model 3 production, Tesla anticipates   hiring an additional 3,000 employees as part of its plan to grow   its production in Fremont, putting total Tesla Fremont employees   above 9,000.But the company isn't waiting for this expansion to start   building production capacity for Model 3. In its most recent   shareholder letter, Tesla said it had already completed its   production line layouts for Model 3 and will soon begin   installing new body welding and final assembly lines for the   vehicle.Beyond obtaining approval to expand its factory in         Fremont and preparing to begin tooling for Model 3, the         company also continues to rapidly expand its Gigafactory,         where it plans to build batteries for Model 3 and its         energy-storage business. Tesla's Gigafactory construction         remains on track to support volume Model 3 production in         the second half of 2017, according to the company's most         recent quarterly update.Building a mass-market electric carBig investments will likely be a major theme for Tesla in the   coming quarters, as the Model 3's planned launch for the second   half of 2017 draws closer. Tesla is aiming to achieve high-volume   production before 2017 ends.Tesla's plan to double the size of its Fremont factory, which   once supported production of 500,000 vehicles annually as part of   aGeneral MotorsandToyotapartnership, comes shortly after Tesla decided to double down on   production targets -- a decision that was spurred by a surprising   373,000 deposit-backed reservations for Model 3 within a month   and a half of the vehicle's unveiling.""[G]iven the demand for Model 3, we have decided to advance   our 500,000 total unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X,   and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned,""   Tesla announced in its May 4 quarterly shareholder letter.This revised target marks an astounding fivefold increase in   the company's current annualized vehicle build rate in just two   years' time. With such ambitious plans on such a short timetable,   the company is obviously going to require some significant   investments -- and doubling the size of its car factory is   apparently one of them.Tesla factory in Fremont. Image source: The Motley Fool.Ahead of its Model 3 ramp up, Tesla expects its capital   expenditures (capex) to jump sharply, starting with this quarter.   In the first three quarters of 2016, Tesla's capex amounted to   $759 million, but the company expects to spend just over $1   billion on capex in the fourth quarter alone.Going into 2017, Tesla has said its annual capex will continue   to increase as the company makes payments on Model 3   investments.Investors should keep an eye on the company's investment   progress, with particular interest in whether Tesla is staying on   track with its goal to achieve volume Model 3 production in the   second half of 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrances Inc (ULTA) the Amazon of Brick and Mortar?;12/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUlta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrances Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA) is continuing its stunning growth.Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrWithout a doubt, this is the preeminent retailer in the market today. The only one that even comes close isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), but AMZN doesn't have brick and mortar stores to impede its stunning growth. Meanwhile, ULTA has mega-stores that average 10,000 square feet, with many housing a 1,000-square-foot salon.makeArticleAd();As of August 2015, it had 815 of these stores spread from sea to shining sea. And it continues to open stores at stunning rates, up to 100 stores a year. Some of the newer stores are somewhat smaller than their traditional stores, but these are usually stores that are operating where there is a standard Ulta store nearby. The slimmed-down stores offer more premium products and services.For years, analysts have been saying that ULTA stock can't keep up this pace and that eventually we'll start to see a deterioration of its sales growth and margins.Well, Q3 numbers came out last week and they didn't disappoint. Same-store sales (the true measure of a retailers' strength) were up once again by double digits, and even outpaced the company's own raised guidance for the quarter.5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberRevenues were up 24% year over year. Net income was up 23%.These are impressive numbers. And it's hard to compare Ulta to other big-box retailers, since their product lines are entirely different. So, if we takeTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) as a big-box competitor and look at its recent numbers, you might get an idea of the difference in ULTA's growth versus TGT's.In the most recently reported quarter, Target actually raised its guidance on same-store sales range from -2% to 0, to -1% to 1%. And same-store sales were down 0.2% for the quarter. Ulta same-store sales were up 17% for the quarter.What about online? TGT is doing well online, where online sales growth grew 26% year over year. But TGT has declining same-store sales, so it's vital that TGT makes up some ground on its waning brick and mortar business.On the other hand, ULTA online sales are up almost 60% so far this fiscal year.The one concern you will hear about ULTA is that it can't keep growing at this pace. And once the growth stops, it will collapse. But the 'experts' have been saying that for the past decade. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.The Biggest Enemy to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)     Stock Right Now? Time.The fact is, ULTA stock has proven it can sustain this growth and make its brick-and-mortar stores as valuable as its growing online business. Right now, margins aren't growing as fast as they could, but that's because it is continually rolling money back into expansion plans.This is a good thing, but it's the same knock people use against Amazon. And that company has been on a growth tear for a very long time. I expect the same for Ulta.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Market Fallout From the EPA's Rush Decision;12/8/2016;"With the sun setting on the Obama presidency, the   administration and government agencies are moving quickly to set   in stone as many regulations as possible before President-elect   Donald Trump takes office. With that in mind, the Environmental   Protection Agency recently announced that is moving to finalize   its 2025 corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission targets   well ahead of its 2018 deadline. While this would not be   impossible for a Trump administration to roll back, the auto   industry has no choice but to move forward as if this aggressive   target will be the law of the land.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The EPA will require automakers to have a fleet average of   54.5 miles per gallon. If that looks like a high number to you,   it's because it is. Official testing numbers are always higher   than real-world results -- theWall Street Journalexpects the actual number to be closer to 40 mpg, but even then   it's still a huge gap to bridge.Currently, vehicles average 24.8 mpg in real-world use. While   we have seen a huge, 28% improvement in efficiency over the last   decade -- thanks, in part, to forced induction, direct injection,   and stop-start technology -- that only equated to 5.5 miles per   gallon. A similar efficiency increase would leave us just over 30   mpg and well short of the EPA's mandate.There's only one way to meet this aggressive goal: a massive   increase in electric vehicle sales over the next decade.   Significant efforts to achieve this goal are already underway.   The implications of this have flown under the market's radar,   giving investors an opportunity to be ahead of the curve.One winnerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is poised to be a winner despite increased direct   competition from established luxury players and downward pricing   pressure from mass-market manufacturers. Unlike legacy   automakers, Tesla won't be burdened by attempting to juggle the   production, sales, and maintenance of two different propulsion   systems to meet these new stringent regulations.Tesla is also better positioned and further along its   transition from pure carmaker to mobility provider. Investors   should not underestimate the significance of the automaker's   Gigafactory -- its massive scale lowers costs and enables the   company to become a battery supplier to the rest of the   industry.Volkswagenis planning to build its own battery production facility in   Germany, but smaller automakers may decline the huge up-front   costs of a vertically integrated supply chain. Given its   execution risk and premium valuation, Tesla may not be the safest   play for investors, but I anticipate it will remain a leader in   the space.One loserSuppliers who derive a large portion of their revenue from   powertrain systems, likeDelphiAutomotive(NYSE: DLPH) , will face stagnation, if not erosion of that   business over the coming decades. Delphi's largest unit is still   electrical/electronic architecture, but 28% of its net sales in   2015 were tied to the internal combustion engine.The rise of electrification and advanced driving technology   has also given rise to new competitors. Take, for instance,General Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt, a $37,500 mass-market EV with a   200-mile range. The Bolt's battery pack, motors, and infotainment   system are supplied by South Korean consumer-electronics giantLG.This is not simply an anecdotal point. As cars transition   toward becoming giant self-driving smartphones, the OEMs will   require a set of solutions more easily supplied by large tech   companies. Current suppliers need forward-thinking management,   plus a commitment to innovation, and even then they still may   come up short.The Foolish bottom lineWhile auto industry insiders may be grumbling about the EPA's   aggressive move to finalize without further debate, the   requirements itself are not a surprise -- the industry agreed to   these terms in 2012. Given the long lead time of auto development   and the giant step up in requirements, it's only a matter of time   before consumers have a variety of electric options at different   price points from most automakers.We can't afford to think of this as just a typical cyclical   industrial industry anymore. Major upheaval is on the cusp of   happening, and a forward-looking view of the new automotive   landscape will reward investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Facebook Inc (FB), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG);12/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsNewer technology names continue to struggle during this sector   migration as investors continue to eye the new bull market   sectors like materials, industrials and transportation stocks.   The result is that a large number of the traditional technology   leaders are under pressure from their charts.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all in the position of lagging broader indices. It has   become time for a make-or-break situation as each are currently   facing short-term chart resistance.makeArticleAd();Facebook Inc (FB)Shares of Facebook had struggled since the election for a few   reasons. The drop in price transitioned the 50-day moving average   for FB stock into a bearish trend, indicating a higher   probability of lower prices over the next 4 to 6 weeks if the   trend remains in place.The fact that the stock recently moved below its heavily   monitored 200-day trendline and is now finding resistance at the   $120-price where it resides has put Facebook shares into this   must-win situation. This is FB's current ""must-win"" price as a   break above will open some room overhead for the stock to move   higher.The 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of       2016Facebook shares recently benefited from an oversold technical   bounce, but volume has dried after that rally, indicating that   the bounce may be more of the ""dead cat"" variety.For now, traders should steer clear of FB as a rejection   at $120 is likely to target another wave of selling and the   potential for Facebook to test its June lows of $108.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)Another technology company struggling in a downward trend is   Tesla Motors. Since peaking in April, TSLA shares have shed over   25% as the stock charts a pattern of lower highs and lower   lows.  The pattern suggests that Tesla stock is   suffering as traders and investors are taking any rally as   an opportunity to reduce holdings.From a long-term perspective, TSLA is trading in a bear market   as the stock is well below its 20-month moving average, which is   also trending lower. Some traders may see Tesla stock as a   ""value"", but the technical trend suggests otherwise.Looking at the chart, TSLA's ""must win"" price is at $195; the   spot where its 50-day moving average currently sits. This   trendline has been staunch resistance for Tesla stock since it   rolled over in August and began to trend lower.From there, TSLA stock gets into a technical pinch as   support is immediately below at $180. This means that we're   likely to see an increase in volatility in Tesla shares as one of   these key levels is going to give way for the next big move in   the stock.Alphabet Inc (GOOG)Alphabet is the last of the stocks in the technical must-win   situation today. While GOOG shares have been lagging the   broader market, they are performing better than a large number of   technology stocks.As early as last week, Alphabet shares found key support at   their 200-day moving average. From there, GOOG stock shot back to   the $800-level where it is going to find some resistance impeding   its move higher.International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)       Stock: 2 Reasons to BuyThe proposed resistance comes in the form of a confluence of   technical trendlines, namely the 50- and 100-day moving averages   of Alphabet's price. Both trendlines intersect just below $800   and they will certainly start to tip technical traders to sell   unless GOOG stock breaks cleanly higher.Volume on Alphabet shares is lightening up a bit as the   traders are taking a wait and see attitude towards the $200   price. This makes this level the ""must win"" target for   GOOG over the next few trading days.Failure to break higher will likely result in another trip to   the $760 price, where the 200-day trendline resides. This has   supported the stock twice in the last month. Given the inversion   of the 50-day moving average, the risk of the 200-day moving   average giving way to lower prices is now higher.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberThe 10 Best IPOs to Buy in 2017The post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Facebook Inc   (FB), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Rising Oil Prices Are Good for EVs and Renewable Energy;12/8/2016;"If you're a fan of wind power, solar power, electric vehicles,   or any other form of alternative energy or transportation, you   should be cheering OPEC's recently announced agreement to cut 1.8   million barrels per day in production from both OPEC and non-OPEC   countries' supply. Most of the reaction on the stock market   related to oil stocks surging, but this is really great news for   alternative energy as well.The reason comes down to the other half of the energy equation   we often don't talk about. The simple fact of the matter is that   many in the industry are beginning to talk regularly about how   quickly the cost of solar energy is falling or how cheap   batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming. But the other   side is the fossil fuel energy they're competing against. Higheroil   pricesmake EVs more attractive on a cost basis and will make   corporations, consumers, and governments think twice about where   they're spending energy dollars in the future. Rising oil prices   is the push alternatives need.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The dollar drives everythingIf you look at the growing adoption of solar energy, wind   energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles -- the four biggest   cogs in a renewable energy future -- they've all been driven   primarily by economics over the past decade.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity subsidiary grew on the back of a $0   down solar lease and wind and solar energy are winning   competitive bids for electricity contracts around the world. New   technologies like energy storage are helping commercial customers   lower electricity bills and costs are improving constantly. To   top it off, EVs are starting to take off just as cars priced   around $35,000 are hitting the market.Subsidies get a lot of coverage in the media, but non-fossil   fuel forms of energy are competing with fossil fuels because   they're a lower-cost option and that cost advantage is improving   by the day. Higher oil prices only improves the competitive   advantage of alternative energy, which makes it more attractive   to buyers like utilities and corporations making choices about   where they're going to get energy in the future.The perception battle in energyOne of the strange dynamics in energy is that oil dominates   perception of what sources of energy are competitive. Even in   solar energy, where the competition is really with coal and   natural gas, when oil is high people love the idea of solar   energy, and when oil is low investors just don't believe in the   solar future.This can be seen on the stock market, where solar   manufacturers and developersFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have long been impacted directly by the price of   oil. Look below at their performance as oil prices dropped in   2014. As oil fell, so did their stocks, even though they're not   really related businesses.WTI Crude Oil Spot Pricedata byYCharts.Whether you're thinking about putting solar on your roof or   buying your next vehicle, the perception of energy prices is just   as important as the real price you pay for energy. And increasing   oil and gasoline prices are maybe the best reminder of what   energy costs, whether or not they directly compete with   alternative sources of energy.Where we can expect to see winnersIf oil prices do rise, I would expect that to have a major   impact on the adoption rate of electric vehicles. Tesla is   clearly leading the charge there led by the Model S and upcoming   Model 3, butGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevy Bolt hitting the market later this year will be   worth watching if gasoline heads toward $4 per gallon again. EVs   can justify themselves on economics alone if gas prices rise. It   costs about $12 to fill a Model S with over 300 miles of range,   compared to $40 or more if gas is $4 per gallon. So, rising gas   prices will make EVs more competitive just as low cost EVs hit   the market.Solar and wind energy will also be winners, particularly on   the utility side. When wind and solar projects are built, they   come with long-term power purchase agreements, setting the price   of electricity for a utility. Rising oil prices will be another   hard reminder that commodity risk falls on consumers, and with   the cost of renewable energy now competitive with fossil fuel   across the country, it'll be a risk regulators won't want to ask   customers to take.On the consumer end of things, we could see another big solar   push as well. What better way to break free of foreign oil than   by putting solar on your roof and using it to charge your   electric vehicle?Surging oil prices may be just what alternative fuels and   renewable energy need heading into a Trump administration. And it   looks like they'll be here just in time.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can’t Count on a Boost From Self-Driving Cars;12/6/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn September of this year, investors were led to believeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) was backing off on its plans to build a self-driving car from the ground up. The companylaid off a few dozen employeeswho had been working on the project, nicknamed Titan, just a few months after naming Apple veteran Bob Mansfield as chief of the Apple car project. The sudden (and mostly unexpected) changes suggested to current and would-be owners of AAPL stock that things were not going swimmingly on the autonomous vehicle front.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashAs it turns out, the market may have read a little too much into the restructuring.Though Apple may well be backing off on its plans to develop its own car, as a letter recently submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) suggests the company has put the pedal to the metal with its plans to build an artificial intelligence system that can drive a car.Apple ""Investing Heavily In Machine Learning""In aletter written by Apple's VP of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, to the NHSTA on Nov. 22, Apple noted:""Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year … It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.Apple affirms that, in order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHSTA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlines in Section IV of the Policy - including expanded exemption authority - with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology.""Translation: Apple is very much behind the eight-ball in terms of developing self-driving systems, and unless the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration helps the company out in a big way, AAPL shareholders are going to be severely disappointed that Apple didn't capitalize on the opportunity when it could have done so several years ago.7 A-Rated Tech Stocks That Power the IndustryRivals already working on machine-learning for the purpose of autonomous cars are, of course,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), just to name a few. GM already has a fleet ofabout 30 autonomous vehiclesin testing, and the technology now comesstandard on all Teslas. Alphabet - Google - has already put2 million miles on its fleet of autonomous cars.It's not clear where the development of the self-driving Apple car technology is. It is clear, though, it's not nearly as far along as the platform created by others in the space. It has got a lot of catching up to do. The letter to the NHTSA was meant to be a means of keeping that door open.Bottom Line for AAPL StockApple spokesman Tom Neumayradded to the discussion on Friday of last week:""We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. … There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.""It's Neumayr's thoughts that really add some much-needed color to the matter … that,and the notion that""established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.""In short, Apple knows it's behind its competition, but after spending an untold amount of money on the development of self-driving automobile technology, it can't walk away empty-handed now.Perhaps the most noteworthy thing owners of AAPL stock may want to digest is that Kenner's letter was neither solicited nor required. The NHTSA is simply open to hearing suggestions about how it can most effectively shape its guidelines for the advent of autonomous cars. Apple's suggestions just so happen to be favorable to Apple's present situation on the R&D front; the agency isn't required to take them.Expedia Inc (EXPE) Spinoff Trivago Nears IPO TakeoffIn a bigger sense, the fact that a five-page plea was submitted at all at this stage of the game could be an indirect sign that Apple is simply too far behind in this race to ever meaningfully catch up.That's OK. Such a platform was never entirely in the company's wheelhouse anyway. Unless its work-to-date is close to being a finished project though - something Apple could plug into a car in the very near future with little additional cost - AAPL shareholders may find the autonomous car project is a little too fruitless to continue supporting.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Best Investments for 2017The 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of 2016The postApple Inc.

3 Stocks That Could Make You Rich;12/1/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.If someone tells you that they have stock picks that they   guarantee will make you rich -- run the other way. However, an   investment style of looking for rule-breaking companies with   incredible management teams, ones that are investing in   exponential growth rather than meeting short-term expectations,   is a good way to earn long-term portfolio growth. Here's why   these three stocks are those kinds of holdings, along with other   companies that fall within the same investing style, that could   make investors rich.Under ArmourUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UA-C) was a market darling for the last few   years -- until it wasn't in the most recent quarter. Shares were   hammered around 20% the day of its recent Q3 earnings release   when management said that it no longer expected to reach a 2018   profit goal of $800 million.makeArticleAd();Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said the reason that the company   would not meet its previous goal is that it is investing more   heavily in future growth, including building out its   international business and increasing its focus on footwear. The   company is also making other investments in things likeoverhauling its manufacturing processesand starting new lines of clothing such as the recently launched   Under Armour Sportswear.From Under Armour's manufacturing innovation lab in Baltimore.   Image source: Under Armour.This is the perfect example of a company that the market has   punished for taking a long-term growth strategy. To be fair,   Under Armour certainly faces risks from intense competition and   other hurdles to future growth, but so far the company has   continued to innovate and grow in incredible ways, and its future   prospects still look solid. Sales are still on track to reach   their previously set goal of $7.5 billion by 2018, so for   investors willing to look past 2018 earnings, this recent drop   could be a very attractive entry point for longer-term gains.ShopifyAnother stock with massive long-term potential isShopify(NYSE: SHOP) , the online shopping and payment portal that has   partnered with some of the biggest names in business as well as   hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs to provide e-commerce   solutions. Now with more than 325,000 merchants as of the most   recent quarter, a 62% jump year over year, Shopify is beginning   to reach a scale at which it will start to become very   interesting. The total value of sales processed through Shopify's   platform was almost $4 billion during the quarter, double from a   year ago.Image source: Shopify.To attract merchants, Shopify just recently began offering   payment solutions throughFacebookMessenger, released a Shopify mobile app to make it easier for   merchants to do business on the go, and addedApplePay to its website. Sales for the most recent quarter grew   89% year over year, and they look to have plenty of room to keep   surging.Shopify is still reporting a loss, as it's using money to   invest in making its platform better, and also spending more   heavily on marketing and other ways to bring on more merchants.   However, Shopify recently closed a successful new stock offering,   meaning that it has plenty of cash for the year ahead, and   expects to break even in 2017. For all of those reasons,Shopify stock looks like a growth gem.Image source: NvidiaNVIDIALast but certainly not least,NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)  continues to prove why it deserves a place   on this list. This chipmaker is one of the most dynamic and   connected companies in its industry, working withthe biggest namesin autonomous cars, video games, virtual reality development, and   artificial intelligence. The company recently announced   that its Drive PX2 platform will officially be used for   Tesla's future self-driving cars.In the most recent quarter, NVIDIA blew analyst expectations   out of the water by reporting $2 billion in sales, ahead of the   $1.68 billion guidance. GAAP earnings per share grew an   impressive 89% year over year.NVIDIA is by far the leader in many of the most exciting   categories it's going after, and its technology looks to be   leading in those areas. The stock has risen substantially already   this year, so its price-to-earnings ratio looks relatively   expensive now at 48. Still, with earnings growing quickly, the   stock is trading at 35 times next year's earnings estimate, and   looking further out into the future, this stock looks even more   attractive.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

The company is starting small by going after the bus market, but its technology could soon find its way into autonomous cars through partnerships with major automobile manufacturers.TheOlli driverless transit vehiclewas shown off at the Los Angeles Auto Show with full demonstrations. Designed by Local Motors, this is the first product to use Watson in its automotive technology. This autonomous car can transport 12 passengers along pre-determined or on-demand routes at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. Local Motors calls the vehicle perfect for current bus routes, airports, theme parks or college campuses.10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017IBM stock won't see a huge boost from this early Watson-powered device. The possibilities here are what investors should be excited about when International Business Machines finally lands inside other autonomous cars.Perhaps the coolest feature from IBM's Watson is theabilityfor passengers to talk to their autonomous car Olli and ask questions about the route, the technology used or recommendations for places to go. Watson acts similar toApple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri orAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa.The difference here is that International Business Machines' Watson doesn't just provide facts, it is able to familiarize itself with the person inside the vehicle and learn patterns that could lead to better feedback and recommendations.Earlier this year, Watson software was also used byGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) for its new OnStar Go platform. The service, which will be available to more than 12 million automobiles, is a ""cognitive mobility platform"".Like Olli, passengers will be able to ask for recommendations and see tailored settings to their habits. This OnStar platform will also use IBM to help launch advertisers and partners, likeMastercard Inc(NYSE:MA), iHeartRadio andExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM). This partnership could be the first of several between GM and International Business Machines.IBM has been pushing its internet of things business and is listing automotive as one of the areas on its site. Olli is being rolled out in Washington D.C. and has deals in place with Miami and Las Vegas. This puts autonomous cars on the road using International Business Machines' Watson as the brains.The internet of things market remains a huge opportunity for IBM stock. The companyseesthe IOT market hitting $11 trillion by 2025 and 250 million connected vehicles on the road by 2020. That's why International Business Machines is pushing Watson and its other businesses into connected areas like homes, buildings, retailers and vehicles.IBM pushed Watson into the healthcare field shortly after its Jeopardy win. Watson has gone on to be aforce in the healthcare fieldin areas like medical imaging, cancer treatment, diabetes treatment and diagnostics. A 2013 article hit on the fact thatusing Watson was helping doctors better diagnose patients' conditions. In lung cancer diagnosis, International Business Machines' Watson had a success rate of 90% versus doctors' 50% rate.Bottom Line on IBM StockThe push of IOT and Watson is starting to benefit the company's financials and should soon boost IBM stock. International Business Machines reported a strong third quarter, powered by growth in its cloud businesses.Cloud revenue hit $12.7 billion over the last reported twelve months; Cloud-as-a-Service has an annual run rate of $7.5 billion. And the company's Technology Services & Cloud Platforms segment led the way in the quarter with $8.7 billion in revenue.Can Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to     Sell More Cars?IBM continues to be one of the most promising technology companies for the future. The company is pushing further into the internet of things, a major growth area for years to come. And Watson is a great tool that is being used by the company to expand into new areas. Its entry into autonomous cars may seem small, but with the name recognition of Watson and the demonstration at the Los Angeles Auto Show, I would expect more deals to come soon.IBM stock trades close to a 52-week high and has seen a nice increase of 16% in 2016. The stock has declined 9% over a five-year period and remains far off from the $200-level it saw just a few years ago. Look for Watson and new growth areas to rev up International Business Machines stock over the short- and long-term.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend     Stocks to Buy NowThe Top 10 Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The postInternational Business Machine Corp.'s (IBM) Not-So-Secret Weapon: Watsonappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Can Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to Sell More Cars?;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter the successful completion of the deal to acquireSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY), Elon Musk announced thatTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is officially entering the home building arena. According to Bloomberg, TSLA stock will begin offering revolutionary new solar-powered residential roofs sometime in 2017.Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)In avideo presentationon the Tesla website, Musk stated that his company's new roofs are expected to cost less than traditional roofs, and that ""electricity is just a bonus.""makeArticleAd();Fortune reported that much of the projected cost savings for homeowners is tied to the expectation that a new Tesla solar roof will be""lighter and easier to ship, thus reducing costs on breakage and transportation.""Bloomberg called the roofs ""stunning"" and described them as ""a range of four solar roofing materials that lookvirtually indistinguishable from high-end terracotta, slate or slick modern asphalt shingles.""Musk Will Incorporate Panasonic Solar TechnologyThrough a partnership withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY), a company that has struggled to generate profit in the solar industry, TSLA and SCTY plan to manufacture the solar roof tiles in SolarCity's Buffalo, New York, factory when construction is completed.The 3 Best Mega-Cap Tech Stocks to Buy on a     DipAccording to Musk, the Tesla solar roof tiles could incorporate""a lot of techniques from the automotive glass business,""and that glass is ""very cheap and very resilient."" Ideally, combining TSLA's financial resources with expertise in the creation of increasingly efficient solar panels from SCTY and PCRFY has the potential to yield some extremely impressive residential roofing options.Some analysts are concerned about TSLA's ability to actually manufacture these revolutionary new roofing tiles in the large-scale quantities that might be necessary if Musk's endeavor takes off. Additionally, there has been concern about theinternal technology Musk will be usingto generate electricity from a Tesla solar roof; two years ago, SCTY acquired a small startup calledSilevo, which had been developing new technology that apparently exceeded the efficiency of existing solar panels.However, the Silevo panels hadn't reached production stage, yet, and SCTY has not announced any advancements in their development. But, according to Fortune, SCTY stated that the Tesla solar roof will incorporate several components from all three companies - Tesla, SolarCity and Panasonic - and""integrate them into the new solar module that will be produced in Buffalo, NY.""Can a Tesla Solar Roof Sell More Cars?While it wasn't something directly mentioned or discussed by Musk, it's hard to ignore the connection between TSLA's dominant electric vehicle line and the creation of high-end residential solar roofs.With more businesses and consumers looking to ""go green"" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Tesla and SolarCity are both in solid positions to excel in the years ahead.That being said, it's not a giant leap to imagine TSLA offering to add the proper electrical interface and infrastructure required to house a Tesla vehicle into a home being outfitted with a new solar roof.On the east coast, for example, one of the largest obstacles to owning a Model S is a lack of charging stations. Owners mustmodify existing electrical systems in their homesto allow for proper charging of such a vehicle.Considering that the Tesla solar roof currently resembles modern high-end roofing materials, the demographic that would most likely be in a position to afford such a purchase might also likely be amenable to purchasing a high-end electric car. This possibility could be increased if incentives were added to solar roof purchases, making a new TSLA vehicle even more affordable.What This Means for TSLA and SCTY InvestorsIn the short term, there isn't likely to be much in the way of an impact on SCTY or TSLA stock, as Musk's recent announcement was just that - an announcement. There is, indeed, rather significant potential for shareholders if Musk can successfully manufacture his solar roof tiles in sufficient quantities and at affordable prices. However, none of this will happen until the construction of SolarCity's new factory in Buffalo is finally completed.Considering only the new solar roof project, shareholders of both SolarCity andTesla stockshould continue to hold their current positions.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Surface Studio     Upgradability Is HorridBut, once construction of the Buffalo factory is finished and manufacturing of the solar roof tiles begins, investors should keep a close eye on the sales and production numbers.Bottom Line on Tesla and SolarCityA partnership between Tesla, the undisputed king of the electric automobile market, and SolarCity, the largest residential and commercial solar energy provider in the U.S., has the potential to be a match made in heaven, ultimately benefiting both companies and their respective shareholders - if Musk's bold jump into the residential solar arena pays off.Even considering the fact that the solar roof technology Musk intends to use hasn't been as extensively tested as traditional solar cell materials and techniques, the companies involved - Tesla, SolarCity, and Panasonic - are an impressive force with extensive resources and experience in this industry.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldThe postCan Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to Sell More Cars?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Finally, Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Gets Some Love!;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares inFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) were on fire to start December, as both saw strong gains in November sales and investors suddenly saw how cheap GM and Ford stock are.Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)The big U.S. brands rose rather than their international competitors because U.S. demand again was dominated by light trucks, with both Ford and GMbeating analyst estimates on sales growth.Ford alone sold over 197,000 vehicles during November, with pickup sales growing 14% to 72,000.makeArticleAd();Even with gains of nearly 7% in Ford stock and 5% in GM stock, these picks are still incredibly cheap. Ford trades at just 7 times earnings, it's covering its dividend of 15 cents per share easily with profits, and the yield of 4.7% is higher than any government bond. GM boasts a P/E of slightly more than 4, and a yield of 4.2% is covered four times over by net income.Can the Love Last?What everyone asks when there are good auto sales is, can it last?It is now assumed that, in a world of Trump, which is dedicated to protecting manufacturing and energy jobs, the answer at least for now is that it can. If it can, your investment in General Motors stock today will be covered by earnings before the new President's term expires in early 2021.10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017The question becomes whether these companies deserve a higher multiple, and more stock market respect, than they are currently getting.WhileTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is marginally profitable and is worth more than half its big auto rivals, and over 7 times its annual sales, Ford is consistently profitable, yet F stock sells for just one-third of its annual sales volume.Ford and GM also retain the financial strength to go after the heart of Tesla's strategic advantages,autonomous drivingandalternative fuel vehicles.Ford's work in alternative fuels was spurred by Obama administration CAFE standards mandating that cars get 60 miles to the gallon by 2025, and light trucks get50 miles to the gallon. Electric vehicles, which don't use gasoline, are included in the calculations, making the numbers manageable.Will Institutions Buy GM and Ford Stock?While there was more institutional selling of Ford stock than buying during the third quarter, several hedge funds jumped in.If the balance between buying and selling adjusts to the buy side this quarter, it could cause a run on the stock which, even if it leads to a P/E of just 10, would bring a 40% gain to both Ford and GM stock holders.When last reported on the companies' 13-F reports, just 56% of Ford stock was held by institutions, while more than 70% of GM stock was institutionally owned. By way of contrast, over 80% of stock in Google parentAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is held by institutions.Institutions have been reluctant to invest in the automakers because they have seen it as a no-growth area with outdated technology. But autonomous, self-driving cars should be a high-growth market opportunity, and if the automakers continue to seize it as they are presently doing the view of both stocks could shift dramatically in 2017.Fitbit Inc (FIT) In Talks to Acquire Smartwatch     Pioneer PebbleOn the other hand, this could be a one-off, a knee-jerk reaction to better-than-expected sales news, and the gains could be short-lived if institutional buyers decide that incentives merely stole volume from later sales, and that profitability will be reduced by those incentives, which often include knocked-down prices and interest-free loans. Higher interest rates also could have a dramatic impact on the sector, making such deals unavailable to next year's buyers.For now, the automakers are enjoying the one-day stand and hoping it becomes a more permanent relationship.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Why GM Is Willing to Lose 9K on Each Green Vehicle Sold;12/1/2016;"General Motors CompanyGMis expected to incur a loss of around $9,000 on every Chevrolet Bolt it will be selling in the U.S. The automaker is willing to bear the expenses as it believes that the strategy will pay off in the long run.makeArticleAd();Other automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.FCAUand Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.NSANYare also incurring losses in order to sell zero emission vehicles (ZEV). Fiat Chrysler is losing $14,000 per vehicle while Nisan Leaf has advertised low lease deals for $149.The reasons behind this strategy include:State GuidelinesThe state of California requires automakers to sell some environment-friendly vehicles in order to do business there. Nine other states have also adopted this strategy, including New York and New Jersey. Together, these states make up around 30% of the total U.S. market. This forces automakers to boost sales of ZEV in these markets.Stricter state laws are expected to require ZEVs to contribute 15.4% of vehicle sales by 2025, which is five times the current level. To meet this target, sales of ZEVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars will rise.Moreover, after the development of charging-station infrastructure and decline in battery costs, global demand for ZEV is poised to rise significantly. There will also be huge demand for ZEVs in China as it is taking note of the climate change threats.Tax BenefitsU.S. offers incentives for the productions of ZEVs. The government provides $7,500 of tax credits to buyers. In addition, the government gives credits to automakers for fulfilling the greenhouse gas reduction target set by Obama administration.Appeal to Younger CustomersChevrolet Bolt will appeal more to young, technologically savvy customers. Bolt offers 238-mileage, which is better than the other mass-market electric vehicles. It will be available to customers in California and Oregon starting this month. General Motors also plans to launch the Bolt in China and Europe. This will give it an advantage over electric automaker Tesla Motors, Inc.'sTSLAmass vehicle Model 3, which will be available from next year.ZEV CreditsGeneral Motors will earn more credits if it sells more ZEVs. It can also sell the surplus credits to its competitors. This will have a positive impact on the results of the company.Price PerformanceIn the last three months, General Motors' share price increased 7.37% while the auto tire truck market share price declined over 1.09%. The company benefitted from better results recorded in the last quarter and its initiatives including expansion of Maven and investment in facilities.

Thanks to Tesla Motors' Brilliance, Some Auto Suppliers Face Rapidly Approaching Challenges;12/1/2016;"Tesla's Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , one of the few electric vehicle start-ups to   survive the financial crisis and the Great Recession, has done an   incredible job of rebranding the electric vehicle. At a time when   many consumers pictured an electric vehicle as a small,   awkward-looking car that struggled to reach 50 miles per hour on   the highway, Tesla was designing the Model S, which would leave   those stereotypes in the dust. While major automakers' EV   programs remained in their infancy, or neglected, Tesla was   establishing its Supercharger network to alleviate range anxiety   and was breaking ground on its Gigafactory.Tesla, despite its manufacturing flaws and unpredictable   strategy (cough,SolarCityacquisition,cough), has lit a fire under major automakers to accelerate their own   EV programs. And that spells bad news for a cluster of auto   supplier stocks.makeArticleAd();What's the big deal?Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas explained the issue in a   note to investors, while cutting his price target onDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH)  from $74 down to $59:Roughly 25% of Delphi's global profit comes from its     powertrain division, a collection of businesses that optimize     the combustion of diesel and gasoline through highly engineered     pumps, injection systems, fuel delivery, exhaust flow, emission     canisters, throttle controls, and sophisticated control     modules. We're not suggesting these products will be replaced     immediately, but we do see scope for diminished economic     returns given changing OEM priorities that create material risk     to the company's earnings trajectory.To make matters worse for auto supplier stocks, that's far   from the only risk. Their margins would be squeezed if the prices   of steel, copper, aluminum, and other raw material move higher   after years of weakness. Combine that with the fact that major   automakers have begun to consolidate vehicle platforms and parts   in an effort to increase their scale and reduce the number of   suppliers -- that means less pricing power for suppliers, year   after year. In fact,General Motorsplans to move from 14 core and 12 regional vehicle architectures   in 2015 down to 4 vehicle sets by 2025. And that's leaving out   the obvious risk that auto suppliers are tied to a highly   cyclical auto industry, and that a key global market, America,   appears to be plateauing after years of consistent growth. Not to   mention, we're not sure how President-elect Donald Trump's NAFTA   threats will play out for the auto industry.Now, it's not as if the executives at auto suppliers don't see   the looming risks, but so far, they haven't been quick to adapt.   Also, it appears that Tesla, approaching the release of its   mass-affordable Model 3, is looking past traditional suppliers.   ""Tesla is turning to South Korean parts makers, which are more   cost-competitive than Japanese rivals, as the electric car   start-up plans to drastically cut costs for the cheaper Model 3,""   said Eim Eun-young, an auto analyst at Samsung Securities,   according toAutomotive News.All is not lostDespite looming headwinds, there are auto suppliers better   suited to survive, and there will be ways for others to evolve,   as none of this will happen overnight. For instance,Lear Corp(NYSE: LEA) is focused on vehicle trends that would be less   impacted by electric vehicles, such as automotive electronics,   higher-quality interiors, and parts in the luxury segment.Magna International Inc.(NYSE: MGA) , as another example, has a massive global footprint   that is extremely important to major automakers and generates   almost half of its sales from Detroit automakers, which will   continue to produce a plethora of trucks and SUVs for the   foreseeable future.Delphi even has ambitious plans beyond electric vehicles. It   has announced a partnership withMobileyeandIntelto collaborate on developing self-driving car technology.   The goal is to develop a complete turnkey ""SAE Level 4/5   automated driving solution"" -- a system that manufacturers could   purchase, rather than research and develop on their own.All is not lost for auto supplier stocks, but they're trading   at cheap valuations for a reason, and you can hardly blame   investors for sitting this one out until suppliers prove they can   adapt and grow their top lines in an auto industry that's poised   to change more in the next two decades than it has in the past   century.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding with the aim of creating a joint venture to build a large number of high-powered charging stations. This will promote the use of electric vehicles for long distance travel.Per this target, most of the charging stations will be situated along highways and major thoroughfares. The chargers will have power levels up to 350 kilowatt to enable fast charging.Construction of the charging stations will commence in 2017 with an initial goal of 400 locations. Within 2020, the companies aim to build a network of thousands of charging points. While Ford, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen will have equal share in the joint venture as founding partners, they are open to the participation of other automakers.Vehicles of all brands that are equipped with Combined Charging System will be able to use the charging network. This move is aimed at facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles in Europe.Notably, the charging network will help these automakers to complete with Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) in the electric vehicle segment. Tesla is a leader in the EV market due to its attractive, technologically advanced products as well as a strong Supercharger network in North America, Europe and Asia. The electric vehicle manufacturer presently has 744 Supercharger stations with 4,703 Superchargers globally. These Superchargers deliver up to 120 kW of power.All five automakers have delivered a negative performance over the last year due to the general weakness in the Zacks-categorized Auto-Tires-Truck industry.The industry posted a 5.8% fall in price over the last one-year period, compared to a 4.2% gain recorded by the S&P 500 market.Zacks RankBMW currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Ford, Daimler and Volkswagen carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Confidential from ZacksThis week, Zacks researchers have named 7 other stocks that look to break out even sooner than today's Bull of the Day.
